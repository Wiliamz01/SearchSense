    "    1. Certain websites cause the error of, specified here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23013220/max-retries-exceeded-with-url-in-requests, which is a connection error. \n",
    "        - this appears to be windows specific as this was not a relevant issue when testing code in ubuntu 22.04, some forum reflect similar message\n",
    "        - FAILED SOLUTION: first response in that stackoverflow page, still kept the stuff bc it seemed like better QOL\n",
    "        - ATTEMPTED SOLUTION: used try and except. NOTE: this solution is not ideal as it does not resolve the issue, it just ignores it and moves on.\n",
    "- **Resolved**\n",
    "    1. The search \"what is a taylor series\" returns SSLCertVerification Error.\n",
    "        - this resolution does not consider the security of the websites being accessed, potentially use try except to have the request verify when possible and not break when cannot verify\n",
    "        - ATTEMPTED SOLUTION: used try except to use verify=False when ssl error occurs. Nested try except to ensure that both connection error and ssl error are handled.\n",
