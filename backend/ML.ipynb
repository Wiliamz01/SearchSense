Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer device like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lot of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving result that were not possible before. In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification task directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning model can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architecture that contain many layers. Why It Matters How It Works Deep Learning with MATLAB Why Deep Learning Matters How doe deep learning attain such impressive results? In a word, accuracy. Deep learning achieves recognition accuracy at higher level than ever before. This help consumer electronics meet user expectations, and it is crucial for safety-critical application like driverless cars. Recent advance in deep learning have improved to the point where deep learning outperforms human in some task like classifying object in images. While deep learning wa first theorized in the 1980s, there are two main reason it ha only recently become useful: Deep learning requires large amount of labeled data. For example, driverless car development requires million of image and thousand of hour of video. Deep learning requires substantial computing power. High-performance GPUs have a parallel architecture that is efficient for deep learning. When combined with cluster or cloud computing, this enables development team to reduce training time for a deep learning network from week to hour or less. Examples of Deep Learning at Work Deep learning application are used in industry from automated driving to medical devices. Automated Driving: Automotive researcher are using deep learning to automatically detect object such a stop sign and traffic lights. In addition, deep learning is used to detect pedestrians, which help decrease accidents. Aerospace and Defense: Deep learning is used to identify object from satellite that locate area of interest, and identify safe or unsafe zone for troops. Medical Research: Cancer researcher are using deep learning to automatically detect cancer cells. Teams at UCLA built an advanced microscope that yield a high-dimensional data set used to train a deep learning application to accurately identify cancer cells. Industrial Automation: Deep learning is helping to improve worker safety around heavy machinery by automatically detecting when people or object are within an unsafe distance of machines. Electronics: Deep learning is being used in automated hearing and speech translation. For example, home assistance device that respond to your voice and know your preference are powered by deep learning applications. How Deep Learning Works Most deep learning method use neural network architectures, which is why deep learning model are often referred to a deep neural networks. The term “deep” usually refers to the number of hidden layer in the neural network. Traditional neural network (4:37) only contain 2-3 hidden layers, while deep network can have a many a 150. Deep learning model are trained by using large set of labeled data and neural network architecture that learn feature directly from the data without the need for manual feature extraction. Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning: Choosing the Right Approach 3:40 Video length is 3:40 Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning: Choosing the Right Approach Figure 1: Neural networks, which are organized in layer consisting of a set of interconnected nodes. Networks can have ten or hundred of hidden layers. One of the most popular type of deep neural network is known a convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet). A CNN convolves learned feature with input data, and us 2D convolutional layers, making this architecture well suited to processing 2D data, such a images. CNNs eliminate the need for manual feature extraction, so you do not need to identify feature used to classify images. The CNN work by extracting feature directly from images. The relevant feature are not pretrained; they are learned while the network train on a collection of images. This automated feature extraction make deep learning model highly accurate for computer vision task such a object classification. Figure 2: Example of a network with many convolutional layers. Filters are applied to each training image at different resolutions, and the output of each convolved image serf a the input to the next layer. CNNs learn to detect different feature of an image using ten or hundred of hidden layers. Every hidden layer increase the complexity of the learned image features. For example, the first hidden layer could learn how to detect edges, and the last learns how to detect more complex shape specifically catered to the shape of the object we are trying to recognize. What's the Difference Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning? Deep learning is a specialized form of machine learning. A machine learning workflow start with relevant feature being manually extracted from images. The feature are then used to create a model that categorizes the object in the image. With a deep learning workflow, relevant feature are automatically extracted from images. In addition, deep learning performs “end-to-end learning” – where a network is given raw data and a task to perform, such a classification, and it learns how to do this automatically. Another key difference is deep learning algorithm scale with data, whereas shallow learning converges. Shallow learning refers to machine learning method that plateau at a certain level of performance when you add more example and training data to the network. A key advantage of deep learning network is that they often continue to improve a the size of your data increases. Figure 3. Comparing a machine learning approach to categorizing vehicle (left) with deep learning (right). In machine learning, you manually choose feature and a classifier to sort images. With deep learning, feature extraction and modeling step are automatic. Object Recognition: Deep Learning and Machine Learning for Computer Vision (26:57) What Are Convolutional Neural Networks? | Introduction to Deep Learning (4:44) Choosing Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning Machine learning offer a variety of technique and model you can choose based on your application, the size of data you're processing, and the type of problem you want to solve. A successful deep learning application requires a very large amount of data (thousands of images) to train the model, a well a GPUs, or graphic processing units, to rapidly process your data. When choosing between machine learning and deep learning, consider whether you have a high-performance GPU and lot of labeled data. If you don’t have either of those things, it may make more sense to use machine learning instead of deep learning. Deep learning is generally more complex, so you’ll need at least a few thousand image to get reliable results. Having a high-performance GPU mean the model will take le time to analyze all those images. Panel Navigation Deep Learning and Traditional Machine Learning: Choosing the Right Approach Read ebook How to Create and Train Deep Learning Models The three most common way people use deep learning to perform object classification are: Training from Scratch To train a deep network from scratch, you gather a very large labeled data set and design a network architecture that will learn the feature and model. This is good for new applications, or application that will have a large number of output categories. This is a le common approach because with the large amount of data and rate of learning, these network typically take day or week to train. Deep Learning in 11 Lines of MATLAB Code | Deep Learning with MATLAB (2:38) Transfer Learning Most deep learning application use the transfer learning approach, a process that involves fine-tuning a pretrained model. You start with an existing network, such a AlexNet or GoogLeNet, and feed in new data containing previously unknown classes. After making some tweak to the network, you can now perform a new task, such a categorizing only dog or cat instead of 1000 different objects. This also ha the advantage of needing much le data (processing thousand of images, rather than millions), so computation time drop to minute or hours. Transfer learning requires an interface to the internals of the pre-existing network, so it can be surgically modified and enhanced for the new task. MATLAB® ha tool and function designed to help you do transfer learning. Transfer Learning in 10 Lines of MATLAB Code | Deep Learning with MATLAB (3:59) Feature Extraction A slightly le common, more specialized approach to deep learning is to use the network a a feature extractor. Since all the layer are tasked with learning certain feature from images, we can pull these feature out of the network at any time during the training process. These feature can then be used a input to a machine learning model such a support vector machine (SVM). Accelerating Deep Learning Models with GPUs Training a deep learning model can take a long time, from day to weeks. Using GPU acceleration can speed up the process significantly. Using MATLAB with a GPU reduces the time required to train a network and can cut the training time for an image classification problem from day down to hours. In training deep learning models, MATLAB us GPUs (when available) without requiring you to understand how to program GPUs explicitly. Figure 4. Deep Learning Toolbox command for training your own CNN from scratch or using a pretrained model for transfer learning. Deep Learning Applications Pretrained deep neural network model can be used to quickly apply deep learning to your problem by performing transfer learning or feature extraction. For MATLAB users, some available model include AlexNet, VGG-16, and VGG-19, a well a Caffe model (for example, from Caffe Model Zoo) imported using importCaffeNetwork. Use AlexNet to Recognize Objects with Your Webcam Use MATLAB, a simple webcam, and a deep neural network to identify object in your surroundings. Learn more Example: Object Detection Using Deep Learning In addition to object recognition, which identifies a specific object in an image or video, deep learning can also be used for object detection. Object detection algorithm like YOLO can recognize and locate the object in a scene, and can locate multiple object within the image.

Substitute one eigenvalue λ into the equation A x = λ x—or, equivalently, into ( A − λ I) x = 0—and solve for x; the resulting nonzero solutons form the set of eigenvectors of A corresponding to the selectd eigenvalue. This process is then repeated for each of the remaining eigenvalues. Example 1: Determine the eigenvectors of the matrix In Example 1, the eigenvalues of this matrix were found to be λ = −1 and λ = −2. Therefore, there are nonzero vectors x such that A x = x (the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = −1), and there are nonzero vectors x such that A x = −2 x (the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = −2). The eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = −1 are the solutions of the equation A x = −x: This is equivalent to the pair of equations which simplifies to [Note that these equations are not independent. If they were independent, then only ( x 1, x 2) T = (0, 0) T would satisfy them; this would signal that an error was made in the determination of the eigenvalues. If the eigenvalues are calculated correctly, then there must be nonzero solutions to each system A x = λ x.] The equations above are satisfied by all vectors x = ( x 1, x 2) T such that x 2 = x 1. Any such vector has the form ( x 1, x 2) T. and is therefore a multiple of the vector (1, 1) T. Consequently, the eigenvectors of A corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = −1 are precisely the vectors where t is any nonzero scalar. The eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = −2 are the solutions of the equation A x = −2 x: This is equivalent to the “pair” of equations Again, note that these equations are not independent. They are satisfied by any vector x = ( x 1, x 2) T that is a multiple of the vector (2, 3) T; that is, the eigenvectors of A corresponding to the eigenvalue λ = −2 are the vectors where t is any nonzero scalar. Example 2: Consider the general 2 x 2 matrix Express the eigenvalues of A in terms of a, b, c, and d. What can you say about the eigenvalues if b = c (that is, if the matrix A is symmetric)? Verify that the sum of the eigenvalues is equal to the sum of the diagonal entries in A. Verify that the product of the eigenvalues is equal to the determinant of A. What can you say about the matrix A if one of its eigenvalues is 0? The solutions are as follows: The eigenvalues of A are found by solving the characteristic equation, det ( A − λ I) = 0: The solutions of this equation—which are the eigenvalues of A—are found by using the quadratic formula: The discriminant in (**) can be rewritten as follows: Therefore, if b = c, the discriminant becomes ( a − d) 2 + 4 b 2 = ( a − d) 2 + (2 b) 2. Being the sum of two squares, this expression is nonnegative, so (**) implies that the eigenvalues are real. In fact, it can be shown that the eigenvalues of any real, symmetric matrix are real. The sum of the eigenvalues can be found by adding the two values expressed in (**) above: which does indeed equal the sum of the diagonal entries of A. (The sum of the diagonal entries of any square matrix is called the trace of the matrix.) Another method for determining the sum of the eigenvalues, and one which works for any size matrix, is to examine the characteristic equation. From the theory of polynomial equations, it is known that if p(λ) is a monic polynomial of degree n, then the sum of the roots of the equation p(λ) = 0 is the opposite of the coefficient of the λ n−1 term in p(λ). The sum of the roots of equation (*) is therefore −[−( a+ d)]= a+ d, as desired. This second method can be used to prove that the sum of the eigenvalues of any (square) matrix is equal to the trace of the matrix. The product of the eigenvalues can be found by multiplying the two values expressed in (**) above: which is indeed equal to the determinant of A. Another proof that the product of the eigenvalues of any (square) matrix is equal to its determinant proceeds as follows. If A is an n x n matrix, then its characteristic polynomial, p(λ), is monic of degree n. The equation p(λ) = 0 therefore has n roots: λ 1, λ 2, …, λ n (which may not be distinct); these are the eigenvalues. Consequently, the polynomial p(λ) = det( A − λ I) can be expressed in factored form as follows: Substituting λ = 0 into this identity gives the desired result: det A =λ 1, λ 2 … λ n . If 0 is an eigenvalue of a matrix A, then the equation A x = λ x = 0 x = 0 must have nonzero solutions, which are the eigenvectors associated with λ = 0. But if A is square and A x = 0 has nonzero solutions, then A must be singular, that is, det A must be 0. This observation establishes the following fact: Zero is an eigenvalue of a matrix if and only if the matrix is singular. Example 3: Determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the identity matrix I without first calculating its characteristic equation. The equation A x = λ x characterizes the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of any matrix A. If A = I, this equation becomes x = λ x. Since x ≠ 0, this equation implies λ = 1; then, from x = 1 x, every (nonzero) vector is an eigenvector of I. Remember the definition: x is an eigenvector of a matrix A if A x is a scalar multiple of x and x ≠ 0. Since multiplication by I leaves x unchanged, every (nonzero) vector must be an eigenvector of I, and the only possible scalar multiple—eigenvalue—is 1. Example 4: The Cayley‐Hamilton Theorem states that any square matrix satisfies its own characteristic equation; that is, if A has characteristic polynomial p(λ), then p(A) = 0. To illustrate, consider the matrix from Example 1. Since its characteristic polynomial is p(λ) = λ 2+3λ+2, the Cayley‐Hamilton Theorem states that p(A) should equal the zero matrix, 0. This is verified as follows: If A is an n by n matrix, then its characteristic polynomial has degree n. The Cayley‐Hamilton Theorem then provides a way to express every integer power A k in terms of a polynomial in A of degree less than n. For example, for the 2 x 2 matrix above, the fact that A 2 + 3 A + 2 I = 0 implies A 2 = −3 A − 2 I. Thus, A 2 is expressed in terms of a polynomial of degree 1 in A. Now, by repeated applications, every positive integer power of this 2 by 2 matrix A can be expressed as a polynomial of degree less than 2. To illustrate, note the following calculation for expressing A 5 in term of a linear polynomial in A; the key is to consistently replace A 2 by −3 A − 2 I and simplify: This result yields a calculation which you are welcome to verify be performing the repeated multiplications The Cayley‐Hamilton Theorem can also be used to express the inverse of an invertible matrix A as a polynomial in A. For example, for the 2 by 2 matrix A above, This result can be easily verified. The inverse of an invertible 2 by 2 matrix is found by first interchanging the entries on the diagonal, then taking the opposite of the each off‐diagonal entry, and, finally, dividing by the determinant of A. Since det A = 2, but validating the expression in (*) for A −1. The same ideas used to express any positive integer power of an n by n matrix A in terms of a polynomial of degree less than n can also be used to express any negative integer power of (an invertible matrix) A in terms of such a polynomial. Example 5: Let A be a square matrix. How do the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of A 2 compare with those of A? Assuming that A is invertible, how do the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of A −1 compare with those of A? Let λ be an eigenvalue of the matrix A, and let x be a corresponding eigenvector. Then A x = λ x, and it follows from this equation that Therefore, λ 2 is an eigenvalue of A 2, and x is the corresponding eigenvector. Now, if A is invertible, then A has no zero eigenvalues, and the following calculations are justified: so λ −1 is an eigenvalue of A −1 with corresponding eigenvector x.
