Part of a series onand Paradigms Problems ( • ) (ECRAM) Learning with humans Model diagnostics Mathematical foundations Machine-learning venues Related articles Part of a series on Approaches / Technology Glossary Machine learning (ML) is an for solving problems for which development of algorithms by human programmers would be cost-prohibitive, and instead the problems are solved by helping machines \\'discover\\' their \\'own\\' algorithms, without needing to be explicitly told what to do by any human-developed algorithms. When there was a vast amount of potential answers, the correct ones needed to be labeled as valid by human labelers initially and human supervision was needed. As computational power has increased and become more powerful, machines have been able to \\'discover\\' their own models, using , and . Recently, generative have been able to surpass results of many previous approaches. The applications include , , , and medicine, where it is too costly to develop algorithms to perform the needed tasks. The mathematical foundations of ML are provided by methods. is a related (parallel) field of study, focusing on through . ML is known in its application across business problems under the name . Although not all machine learning is statistically-based, is an important source of the field\\'s methods. Basic assumption[] The basic assumption underlying machine learning is that whatever worked in the past (i.e. strategies, algorithms, and inferences) will most likely continue to work in the future. An obvious example is \"since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well\". A more nuanced example is \"in X% of have geographically separate species with color variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered exist\". History and relationships to other fields[] See also: The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by , an employee and pioneer in the field of and . The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period. By the early 1960s an experimental \"learning machine\" with memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by to analyze signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary . It was repetitively \"trained\" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a \"\" button to cause it to re-evaluate incorrect decisions. A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson\\'s book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification. Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973. In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a learns to recognize 40 characters (26 letters, 10 digits, and 4 special symbols) from a computer terminal. provided a widely quoted, more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\" This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally rather than defining the field in cognitive terms. This follows \\'s proposal in his paper \"\", in which the question \"Can machines think?\" is replaced with the question \"Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?\". Modern-day machine learning has two objectives, one is to classify data based on models which have been developed, the other purpose is to make predictions for future outcomes based on these models. A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles. A machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions. Artificial intelligence[] Machine learning as subfield of AI As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for (AI). In the early days of AI as an , some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data. They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed \"\"; these were mostly and that were later found to be reinventions of the of statistics. was also employed, especially in .: 488 However, an increasing emphasis on the caused a rift between AI and machine learning. Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.: 488 By 1980, had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor. Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to , but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in and .: 708–710, 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and around the same time. This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as \"\", by researchers from other disciplines including , , and . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of .: 25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s. The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature. It shifted focus away from the it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, , and . Data mining[] Machine learning and often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, focuses on the of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of in databases). uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as \"\" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy. Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge. Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data. Machine learning also has intimate ties to : many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some on a training set of examples. Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples). Generalization[] The difference between optimization and machine learning arises from the goal of : while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set, machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples. Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for algorithms. Statistics[] Machine learning and are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population from a , while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns. According to , the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics. He also suggested the term as a placeholder to call the overall field. distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, wherein \"algorithmic model\" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning. Physics[] Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of . Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of . Theory[] Main articles: and A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience. Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set. The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases. The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of known as via the (PAC) model. Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms. Instead, probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common. The is one way to quantify generalization . For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data. If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data. If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases. But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to and generalization will be poorer. In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning. In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in . There are two kinds of results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time. Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time. Approaches[] Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the \"signal\" or \"feedback\" available to the learning system: : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a \"teacher\", and the goal is to learn a general rule that inputs to outputs. : No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (). : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as or playing a game against an opponent). As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that\\'s analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize. Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems. Supervised learning[] Main article: A is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a . Here, the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. The data is known as , and consists of a set of training examples. Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal. In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an or vector, sometimes called a , and the training data is represented by a . Through of an , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data. An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task. Types of supervised-learning algorithms include , and . Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range. As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email. is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are. It has applications in , , visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification. Unsupervised learning[] Main article: See also: Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points. The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized. Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data. A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of in , such as finding the . Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features. Unsupervised learning algorithms streamlined the process of survey and graph large based of a gene of interest from . Clustering via Large Indel Permuted Slopes, , turns the alignment image into a learning regression problem. The varied slope (b) estimates between each pair of DNA segments enables to identify segments sharing the same set of indels. Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar. Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters. Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity. Semi-supervised learning[] Main article: Semi-supervised learning falls between (without any labeled training data) and (with completely labeled training data). Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy. In , the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets. Reinforcement learning[] Main article: Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how ought to take in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as , , , , , , , and . In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a (MDP). Many reinforcements learning algorithms use techniques. Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Dimensionality reduction[] is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the set, also called the \"number of features\". Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or . One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is (PCA). PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D). This results in a smaller dimension of data (2D instead of 3D), while keeping all original variables in the model without changing the data. The proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional , and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of and . Other types[] Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system. For example, , . As of 2022, is the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning. Self-learning[] Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA). It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice. The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations. The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion. The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: in situation s perform action a receive consequence situation s\\' compute emotion of being in consequence situation v(s\\') update crossbar memory w\\'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s\\') It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a. There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment. The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation. The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment. After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations. Feature learning[] Main article: Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training. Classic examples include and cluster analysis. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions. This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution. This replaces manual , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task. Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data. Examples include , , and supervised . In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data. Examples include dictionary learning, , , and various forms of . algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional. algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros. algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors. algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features. It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data. Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process. However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features. An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms. Sparse dictionary learning[] Main article: Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of , and is assumed to be a . The method is and difficult to solve approximately. A popular method for sparse dictionary learning is the algorithm. Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts. In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs. For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary. Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot. Anomaly detection[] Main article: In , anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as , a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are referred to as , novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity. This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object. Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately. Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns. Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist. Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set. Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" and involves training a classifier (the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection). Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model. Robot learning[] is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and finally (e.g. MAML). Association rules[] Main article: See also: Association rule learning is a method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of \"interestingness\". Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves \"rules\" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge. The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system. This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction. Rule-based machine learning approaches include , association rule learning, and . Based on the concept of strong rules, , and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } \\\\{{\\\\mathrm {onions,potatoes} }\\\\}\\\\Rightarrow \\\\{{\\\\mathrm {burger} }\\\\} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional or . In addition to , association rules are employed today in application areas including , , , and . In contrast with , association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a , with a learning component, performing either , , or . They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a manner in order to make predictions. (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses. Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that all positive and no negative examples. is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as . Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in and . and laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting. Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples. The term inductive here refers to induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than , proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set. Models[] Performing machine learning can involve creating a , which is trained on some training data and then can process additional data to make predictions. Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems. Artificial neural networks[] Main article: See also: An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of in a . Here, each circular node represents an and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the that constitute animal . Such systems \"learn\" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules. An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called \"\", which loosely model the in a biological . Each connection, like the in a biological , can transmit information, a \"signal\", from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a , and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs. The connections between artificial neurons are called \"edges\". Artificial neurons and edges typically have a that adjusts as learning proceeds. The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection. Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold. Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers. Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs. Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times. The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a would. However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from . Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including , , , filtering, and . consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network. This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing. Some successful applications of deep learning are and . Decision trees[] Main article: A decision tree showing survival probability of passengers on the Decision tree learning uses a as a to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item\\'s target value (represented in the leaves). It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning. Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, represent class labels, and branches represent of features that lead to those class labels. Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically ) are called regression trees. In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and . In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making. Support-vector machines[] Main article: Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related methods used for classification and regression. Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category. An SVM training algorithm is a non-, , , although methods such as exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting. In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the , implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces. Regression analysis[] Main article: Illustration of linear regression on a data set Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features. Its most common form is , where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as . The latter is often extended by methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in . When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel), (often used in ) or even , which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space. Bayesian networks[] Main article: A simple Bayesian network. Rain influences whether the sprinkler is activated, and both rain and the sprinkler influence whether the grass is wet. A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic that represents a set of and their with a (DAG). For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms. Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases. Efficient algorithms exist that perform and learning. Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like or , are called . Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called . Gaussian processes[] Main article: An example of Gaussian Process Regression (prediction) compared with other regression models A Gaussian process is a in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a , and it relies on a pre-defined , or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations. Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point. Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in used to do . Genetic algorithms[] Main article: A genetic algorithm (GA) is a and technique that mimics the process of , using methods such as and to generate new in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem. In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s. Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and . Training models[] Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data in order for the models to perform accurate predictions. When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative of data. Data from the training set can be as varied as a , a collection of images, data, and data collected from individual users of a service. is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model. Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions. Bias models may result in detrimental outcomes thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives. is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training. Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably be integrated within machine learning engineering teams. Federated learning[] Main article: Federated learning is an adapted form of to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users\\' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server. This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices. For example, uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users\\' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to . Applications[] There are many applications for machine learning, including: detection classification analysis detection In 2006, the media-services provider held the first \"\" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%. A joint team made up of researchers from -Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million. Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers\\' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (\"everything is a recommendation\") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly. In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis. In 2012, co-founder of , , predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software. In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists. In 2019 published the first research book created using machine learning. In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19. Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers. Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone\\'s performance and thermal behavior based on the user\\'s interaction with the phone. Limitations[] Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results. Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems. In 2018, a self-driving car from failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision. Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested. Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature. While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves. Bias[] Main article: Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases. A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data. When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society. Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases. Machine learning systems used for criminal risk assessment have been found to be biased against black people. In 2015, Google photos would often tag black people as gorillas, and in 2018 this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data, and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all. Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems. In 2016, Microsoft tested a that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language. Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains. Concern for in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including , who reminds engineers that \"There\\'s nothing artificial about AI...It\\'s inspired by people, it\\'s created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people. It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.\" Explainability[] Main article: Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI. It contrasts with the \"black box\" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision. By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively. XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation. Overfitting[] Main article: The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise. Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting. Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is. Other limitations and vulnerabilities[] Learners can also disappoint by \"learning the wrong lesson\". A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses. A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in \"adversarial\" images that the system misclassifies. Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations. Some systems are so brittle that changing a single adversarial pixel predictably induces misclassification.[] Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and/or evasion via . Researchers have demonstrated how can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories \"spam\" and well-visible \"not spam\" of posts) machine learning models which are often developed and/or trained by third parties. Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of is provided, possibly including . Model assessments[] Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set. In comparison, the K-fold- method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model. In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, , which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy. In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively. Similarly, investigators sometimes report the (FPR) as well as the (FNR). However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators. The (TOC) is an effective method to express a model\\'s diagnostic ability. TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used (ROC) and ROC\\'s associated area under the curve (AUC). Ethics[] See also: , , and Machine learning poses a host of . Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (), thus digitizing cultural prejudices. For example, in 1988, the UK\\'s Commission for Racial Equality found that St. George\\'s Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to be either women or had non-European sounding names. Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants. Responsible and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system thus is a critical part of machine learning. AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information. These decisions rely on the objectivity and logical reasoning. Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language will necessarily also learn these biases. Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care. There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public\\'s interest but as income-generating machines. This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increase profits. For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm\\'s proprietary owners hold stakes. There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated. Hardware[] Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units. By 2019, graphic processing units (), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI. estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months. Neuromorphic/Physical Neural Networks[] A or is a type of in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a . \"Physical\" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate as opposed to software-based approaches. More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse. Embedded Machine Learning[] Embedded Machine Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where the machine learning model is run on with limited computing resources such as , and . Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing, henceforth, reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data, and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties, personal data and business secrets. Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including , using , optimization of machine learning models and many more.

Definition, Basics, Characteristics ByMatthew Martin Hours UpdatedJune 10, 2023 What is Software Engineering? Software engineering is defined as a process of analyzing  requirements and then designing, building, and testing software application which will satisfy those requirements. Let’s look at the various definitions of software engineering: IEEE, in its standard 610.12-1990, defines software engineering as the application of a systematic, disciplined, which is a computable approach for the development, operation, and maintenance of software. Fritz Bauer defined it as ‘the establishment and used standard engineering principles. It helps you to obtain, economically, software which is reliable and works efficiently on the real machines’. Boehm defines software engineering, which involves, ‘the practical application of scientific knowledge to the creative design and building of computer programs. It also includes associated documentation needed for developing, operating, and maintaining them.’ In this software engineering tutorial, you will learn: What is Software Engineering? Why Software Engineering? Software Crisis & its Solution Why Software Engineering is Popular? Relationship of Software Engineering with Other Disciplines Challenges of Software Engineering Attributes for Software Products Characteristics of Good Software Why Software Engineering? Software Crisis & its Solution: What was the Software Crisis? It was in the late 1960s when many software projects failed. Many software became over budget. Output was an unreliable software which is expensive to maintain. Larger software was difficult and quite expensive to maintain. Lots of software not able to satisfy the growing requirements of the customer. Complexities of software projects increased whenever its hardware capability increased. Demand for new software increased faster compared with the ability to generate new software. All the above issues lead to ‘Software Crisis.’ The Solution Solution was to the problem was transforming unorganized coding effort into a software engineering discipline. These engineering models helped companies to streamline operations and deliver software meeting customer requirements. The late 1970s saw the widespread uses of software engineering principles. In the 1980s saw the automation of software engineering process and growth of (CASE) Computer-Aided Software Engineering. The 1990s have seen an increased emphasis on the ‘management’ aspects of projects standard of quality and processes just like ISO 9001 Why Software Engineering is Popular? Here are important reasons behind the popularity of software engineering: Large software – In our real life, it is quite more comfortable to build a wall than a house or building. In the same manner, as the size of the software becomes large, software engineering helps you to build software. Scalability- If the software development process were based on scientific and engineering concepts, it is easier to re-create new software to scale an  one. Adaptability: Whenever the software process was based on scientific and engineering, it is easy to re-create new software with the help of software engineering. Cost- Hardware industry has shown its skills and huge manufacturing has lower the cost of the computer and electronic hardware. Dynamic Nature– Always growing and adapting nature of the software. It depends on the environment in which the  works. Quality Management: Offers better method of software development to provide quality software products. Relationship of Software Engineering with Other Disciplines Here, how software engineering related to other disciplines: Computer Science: Gives the scientific foundation for the software as electrical engineering mainly depends on physics. Management Science: Software engineering is labor-intensive work which demands both technical and managerial control. Therefore, it is widely used in management science. Economics: In this sector, software engineering helps you in resource estimation and cost control. Computing system must be developed, and data should be maintained regularly within a given budget. System Engineering: Most software is a component of a much larger system. For example, the software in an Industry monitoring system or the flight software on an airplane. Software engineering methods should be applied to the study of this type of systems. Challenges of Software Engineering Here are some critical challenges faced by software engineers: In safety-critical areas such as space, aviation, nuclear power plants, etc. the cost of software failure can be massive because lives are at risk. Increased market demands for fast turnaround time. Dealing with the increased complexity of software need for new applications. The diversity of software systems should be communicating with each other. Attributes for Software Products The characteristics of any software product include features which are displayed by the product when it is installed and put in use. They are not the services which are provided by the product. Instead, they have related to the products dynamic behavior and the use made of the product. Examples of these attributes are: Efficiency, reliability, robustness, maintainability, etc. However, the relative importance of these characteristics varies from one software system to another. Product Characteristics Description Maintainability The software should evolve to meet the changing demands of the clients. Dependability Dependability includes various characteristics. Dependable software should never cause any physical or economic damage at the time of system failure. Efficiency The software application should overuse system resources like memory and processor cycle. Usability The software application should have specific UI and documentation. Optimizing the above attribute is very challenging. For example, offering a better UI can reduce system efficiency. Characteristics of Good Software Any software should be judged by what it offers and what are the methods which help you to use it. Every software must satisfy the following attributes: Operational Transitional Maintenance Here are some important characteristics of good software developed by software professionals Operational This characteristic let us know about how well software works in the operations which can be measured on: Budget Efficiency Usability Dependability Correctness Functionality Safety Security Transitional This is an essential aspect when the software is moved from one platform to another: Interoperability Reusability Portability Adaptability Maintenance This aspect talks about how well software has the capabilities to adapt itself in the quickly changing environment: Flexibility Maintainability Modularity Scalability Summary Software engineering is a process of analyzing  requirements and then designing, building, and testing software application which will satisfy that requirements Important reasons for using software engineering are: 1) Large software, 2) Scalability 3) Adaptability 4) Cost and 5) Dynamic Nature. In late 1960s many software becomes over budget. Therefore it offers unreliable software which is expensive to maintain. The late 1970s saw the widespread uses of software engineering principles. Software engineering concept 1) Computer Science 2) Management Science 3) System engineering and 4) Economics Increased market demands for fast turnaround time is the biggest challenges of software engineering field. 1)Maintainability, 2) Dependability, 3) Efficiency and, 4) Usability are the most important attributes of software products. Three most important characteristics of good software are 1) Operational 2)Transitional 3)Maintenance.

      "Next, Martin updates the definition of Software engineering with additional information in order to better understand the challenges facing software engineers. He explains that \"software engineering\" consists of three basic principles: first, a technical overview; second, a descriptive description of what it is like to be a software engineer; and third, a detailed assessment of the capabilities of a particular product or service. Martin then provides an introduction to the concept of Software Crisis, which he calls \"Software Crisis & Solution.\" Martin describes the early 1960s as a time when many large-scale, often expensive, software development was common. This crisis was caused by several factors: high cost, availability, complexity, and/or maintenance. These factors led to the 'Software Crisis'. Martin also discusses the importance of \"operational transitional maintenance,\" i.e., the establishment and use of standard engineering techniques. In this tutorial, Martin introduces the concepts of \"Software Engineering\" and \"Why Software Engineering\" throughout the course of the 2023-2023 study period.\n"
