0,nsta,What is STEM Education? and Why is it important?,https://www.nsta.org/nstas-official-positions/stem-education-teaching-and-learning,"STEM education is an experiential learning pedagogy in which the application of knowledge and skills are integrated through in-context projects or problems focused on learning outcomes tied to the development of important college and career readiness proficiencies. The research (Renninger 2000; Tai et al 2006) identifies that personal interest, experience, and enthusiasm are critical to supporting children’s science learning and can be a catalyst for long-term, sustained interest into adulthood. As described in A Framework for K–12 Science Education, many important decisions in the 21st century will require the abilities of the citizenry to frame scientific questions pertinent to their interests; evaluate complex social, civic, economic, political, and personal issues; seek out relevant data and scientific argument; and communicate their understandings and arguments to others. The importance of STEM education to our nation’s future cannot be overstated. As explained in the National Science Foundation (NSF) report A National Action Plan for Addressing the Critical Needs for U.S. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education System, “In the 21st century, scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society, students need to develop their capabilities in STEM to levels much beyond what was considered acceptable in the past.” (NSF 2007) Over the past 25 years, STEM education has been evolving from a convenient clustering of four overlapping disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) toward a more cohesive knowledge base and skill set critical for the 21st century. It now encompasses areas of computer science, the “designed world,” and robotics, as each of these areas reflect the integration of the original four domains of study in which the goals are to resolve problems and create innovative solutions to proposed challenges. These broader categories reveal the opportunities in the current and future workforce. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, employment in STEM occupations grew much faster than employment in non-STEM occupations over the last decade (24.4% versus 4.0%, respectively), and STEM occupations are projected to grow by 8.9% from 2014 to 2024, compared to 6.4% growth for non-STEM occupations (Department of Commerce 2017). Recent Pew Research Center (Graf et al 2018) data shows that STEM workers earn approximately 25% more than similarly educated non-STEM workers, regardless of the education level attained. Overall, blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce relative to their shares in the U.S. workforce as a whole. The number of women in STEM-related jobs has increased in the areas of life and physical sciences, but has actually decreased in one of the highest-paying and fastest-growing STEM clusters: computer occupations. In 1990, 32% of workers in computer occupations were women; today, women’s share has dropped to 25%. A STEM-literate populace and workforce is necessary to sustain the U.S. competitive advantage in the age of globalization: not only as researchers, doctors, and engineers, but also as a hugely technical workforce that can help secure our health and safety, revitalize our utility infrastructures, monitor our food production, and improve our manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities. We must employ all members of the labor pool, especially those who have been overlooked and underrepresented, such as women and minorities. The National Science Board in A Policy Companion Statement to Science and Engineering Indicators 2018 states, “All our people must be armed with the skills and knowledge to meet the future head-on. Among the groups that are underutilized, yet essential to our future competitiveness, are workers who use technical skills in their jobs but who do not have a four-year degree (“skilled technical workers”), and people at all education levels who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. Growing the skilled technical workforce and reducing barriers to participation in STEM will increase individual economic opportunity and support our Nation’s leadership in science and technology.” STEM Education Today Modern STEM education promotes not only skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, higher-order thinking, design, and inference, but also behavioral competencies such as perseverance, adaptability, cooperation, organization, and responsibility (NSTC 2018). STEM is not a single subject, and it should not replace other subjects. Students need to learn the same concepts and skills in science and mathematics as they did before, and how to solve problems through engineering design challenges. STEM experiences must be connected and support the goals of state science standards, as well as those established in A Framework for K–12 Science Education and articulated in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS),by providing students the opportunity to grasp and experience the relevancy of what they are learning. STEM is also not a curriculum, but rather a way of organizing and delivering instruction. It is not another “ingredient” in the lesson “soup,” but the recipe for helping learners apply their knowledge and skills, collaborate with their peers, and understand the relevance of what they are learning. This does not de-emphasize the teaching of core ideas, but rather gives students the ability to know how they can apply the content they are learning. Today STEM is identified in many different ways, including in computer science and engineering/robotics. Computer science courses focus on problem solving through coding, as in the coding opportunities presented in the Hour of Code, the global movement spurred by education leaders in computer science, or in Girls Who Code, the national nonprofit organization that aims to close the gender gap in technology by building girls’ confidence and expanding their computer experience. Robotic challenges highlight engineering challenges like the FIRST Robotics Competition, which teams students, coaches, and companies. Many corporations, such as Shell, Toyota, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, also promote these engineering design/problem challenges, which are mainly for middle and high school students. STEM education leaders must continue to broaden and deepen the scope of STEM education and further transcend the fields of study beyond just a combination of the four disciplines to include the arts and humanities (i.e., STEAM). The ability to think creatively, to communicate ideas in writing and speech with precision and clarity, to formulate and defend arguments based on evidence, and to create visual or digital models that convey evidence clearly and succinctly require students to have a strong foundation in language and creative arts. The ability to fully comprehend global issues requires that students can acknowledge and appreciate important cultural norms, social biases, and historical accomplishments of other countries and peoples. It is the combination of all of these factors that drive our innovations and technological advancements. To achieve this, educators and other leaders representing the entire educational system should consider redefining what learning success looks like for STEM education. This includes reevaluating how the physical classroom structure could better support inclusion, peer discourse, and ongoing engineering design innovations; making a commitment to advocate for a comprehensive STEM education that begins in preschool and continues post–high school; and actively promoting diversity in STEM education for all students. Lastly, STEM experiences should provide opportunities to unify communities by engaging multiple stakeholder groups, including teachers, business leaders, parents, policy makers, and most of all, students, in working toward common goals. The engagement of the entire community should play a critical role in shaping the STEM vision, promoting its importance economically, supporting its implementation through active participation like mentoring, and creating an environment of shared values. Such community advocacy can improve opportunities for many community members and raise the standard of living for all citizens. Declarations As the leading organization for science teaching and learning, NSTA asserts that educators, administrators, parents, and all stakeholders should consider the following recommendations as they develop and refine STEM education programs. STEM education programs should be grounded in the tenets of constructivism supported by the findings of three decades of cognitive science. Integrated STEM education occurs when learning is viewed as an active, constructive process, and not a receptive one; student motivation and beliefs are integral to cognition; social interaction is fundamental to cognitive development; and knowledge, strategies, and expertise are contextualized in the learning experience. High-quality K–12 STEM education is an essential, relevant, and continual endeavor for all students. STEM education enables analytical and critical thinkers; increases science, mathematics, and technology literacy; fosters the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs; provides opportunities for students to engage in 21st-century skills of teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, communication, and creative thinking; and offers learning experiences in which students apply what they are learning in relevant, meaningful ways. The promotion and advocacy of STEM education should focus on the following: Teachers, school administrators, school boards, and school and dis­trict leaders should identify common goals and pathways to create a shared vision and definition of STEM teaching and learning for their communities. Teachers of STEM should be provided with resources necessary to implement quality STEM education in their classrooms, including opportunities for professional growth and learning through continual and sustained training, mentoring, and support services, as they plan, develop, and execute their STEM lessons and units. Schools and districts should continually provide access to technologies, materials, tools, and resources to facilitate the application of integrated STEM teaching and learning. Schools and districts should recognize that STEM education begins as early as preschool and provide accessible educational experiences that span the preK–16 spectrum. This includes embracing new approaches to STEM teaching, creating new definitions of learning success, and considering new ideas about the physical structure of the educational environment so that it is more inclusive and conducive to exploration, discovery, and design iteration. Schools and districts should implement models of professional learning and ongoing support to sustain changes in pedagogy, including instructional methods that promote learning for adults that mirror the methods to be used with students. Schools, districts, employers, the community at large, and all interested stakeholders should seek opportunities to build a capacity for joint learning, job shadowing, and mentoring of students to support students’ transition into the workforce. Schools, districts, employers, the community at large, and all interested stakeholders should help promote, facilitate, and financially support STEM"

What is STEM Education and why is it important? STEM Education helps in inculcating life long skills in individuals so that they can be practical as they seek to solve everyday problems in their surroundings. It encourages learners to do things and learn from experiences. What does STEM Education mean? STEM Education has 4 letters forming an acronym which stands for studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics or Medicine. How do you define STEM Education? STEM Education is a form of imparting knowledge to ensure that learners get practical skills that they can apply in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. STEM is an acronym for Science, Technology, and Engineering. STEM Education focuses on these four main disciplines. STEM Education Instills Knowledge From an Early Age!

Reading about forests, attending a lecture on what a park ranger does, watching a video called 'A Day in the Life of a Park Ranger' or frequently hiking through national forests? The experience of actually hiking and the pleasant memories associated with the experience, more than any of the other choices listed, would probably spark your interest in that career path. This is the theory behind STEM education. By exposing students to STEM and giving them opportunities to explore STEM-related concepts, they will develop a passion for it and, hopefully, pursue a job in a STEM field. So what is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. These four symbols represent the different areas of STEM education. STEM education integrates concepts that are usually taught as separate subjects in different classes and emphasizes the application of knowledge to real-life situations. A lesson or unit in a STEM class is typically based around finding a solution to a real-world problem and tends to emphasize project-based learning. A variation of STEM is STEAM, which includes an 'A' for art and design. Artistic design is becoming an important part of STEM education since creativity is an essential part of innovation. Many STEM lessons involve building models and simulating situations. A good STEM lesson ensures that students understand the connection to the real world. A sample STEM lesson would start with showing pictures of large barges carrying crates. Then students would experiment with different materials and computer-aided designs in an attempt to build a model boat capable of holding large amounts of pennies. Math would be incorporated by demanding specific measurements for the design and requiring the students to keep within a certain budget for their materials. This experiment models how real-world engineers and scientists try to improve the efficiency of the current shipping designs. STEM education could take place in a separate STEM class or be incorporated into practically any subject and grade level. Of course science and math classes would be able to directly implement STEM-related lessons. In a social studies class learning about the industrial revolution, however, students may design their own assembly line. Or, in an English class, students may be keeping a journal about their thinking and research processes while designing a realistic bridge from a fictional novel. Careers in STEM-related fields are vast and diverse. They obviously include careers in the pharmacy, energy, programming, and engineering fields. However, STEM careers may also take the form of a physician's assistant, network communications expert, or agricultural professional. Finance, risk analysis, and even athletic training have elements of STEM in them. And, of course, teaching is an essential career that stimulates the STEM fields!

Instilling skills such as spatial reasoning, which breaks down a problem by putting it in a three-dimensional space, help clarify abstract concepts. Students can then learn how to apply the concepts by creating practical solutions, which in turn builds their trust in their own knowledge and abilities. The student can then explore the concepts learned and the practical solutions discovered to help solve real-world problems. Students can then look at various issues as they come up, and apply their knowledge and skills to find a solution. Additionally, students can do more research on concepts that interest them the most.

Importance of STEMThe U.S. led the world in STEM fields until recently, but today, fewer students are graduating high school competent in science, technology, engineering and math. According to the U.S. Department of Education, as of 2014, only 16% of high school seniors are proficient in math and wish to pursue a STEM degree. Yet, despite this lack of interest, STEM is all around us. It is a part of everyone's daily lives, from the phones we talk on to the cars we drive and the doctors we visit. seeks to raise students' awareness of how STEM fields affect their daily lives and also seeks to excite them and prepare them for future careers in a STEM-related field. Many new jobs that will be available for students are in the STEM-related fields. It is essential for the survival of the U.S. economy to have people capable of fulfilling these jobs. Ensuring students' interests and competencies is also important for the country as a whole in order to stay competitive in the world market. STEM StandardsAs of 2014, there are no specific national STEM standards, but the Next Generation Science Standards were written to include technology, engineering and math. Common Core, the education standards followed by most states, does not include STEM. However, most individual states have written their own standards and guidelines regarding STEM, which vary from state to state. As of 2014 there are no national requirements for standardized testing related to STEM in public schools, and there are no national requirements to include STEM, but that could change due to the formation of the Committee on STEM Education by President Obama. Lesson SummarySTEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and seeks to increase student competency in these areas, as well as interest in future careers in STEM-related fields by studying real-world problems and solving them through project-based learning. An increase in STEM education and students prepared for STEM-related careers is essential to the survival of our nation and its economy. Though no specific national STEM standards or requirements exist as of 2014, many individual states have written their own standards.

Skills, the thinking goes, that are taught in those subjects. Still, STEM can be hard to define. It’s such a popular term that it means a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Although the science (biology, chemistry, etc.) and math (algebra, calculus, etc.) parts of the acronym might be easy to figure out, the technology and engineering parts might be less clear. Technology includes topics such as computer programming, analytics, and design. Engineering can include topics like electronics, robotics, and civil engineering. The key term when talking about STEM is integration. STEM curriculum intentionally melds these disciplines. It’s a blended approach that encourages hands-on experience and gives students the chance to gain and apply relevant, “real-world” knowledge in the classroom. Education buzzwords and the politicians who love them … Like most things, STEM was around before it had an actual name. But STEM wasn’t known as STEM until Dr. Judith Ramaley coined the term. While working as director at the National Science Foundation in the early 2000s, Ramaley to describe the blended curriculum she and her team were developing. Referred to as SMET at first, which, if we had to guess, might also be the name of a Scandinavian dessert, Ramaley changed the acronym around because she didn’t like how SMET sounded.

Meanwhile, businesses need employees with higher levels of training and education to meet the demands of our 21st century workforce. For example, by 2020, nearly 55% of Colorado’s jobs will require STEM-related training or education. Yet fewer than 25% of Colorado students are earning such credentials. This presents Colorado with a tremendous opportunity to ensure all Colorado students have access to the education and training needed to fill our state’s workforce needs.What Is STEM Education?As an integrated, applied learning program, STEM education can begin as early as elementary school, with a focus on how the scientific method can be applied in everyday life. By high school, STEM programs are more rigorous and can be stand-alone curricula or integrated into various classes.

It would be inaccurate to assume that STEM education is merely instruction in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Rather, the idea is taken a step further. STEM education refers to the integration of the four subjects into a cohesive, interdisciplinary and applied learning approach. This isn’t academic theory—STEM education includes the appropriate real-world application and teaching methods. As a result, students in any subject can benefit from STEM education. That’s exactly why some educators and organizations refer to it as STEAM, which adds in arts or other creative subjects. They recognize just how powerful the philosophy behind STEM education can be for students. Why Is STEM Education Important? There are several layers to explore in discovering why STEM education is so important. Background In 2018, the White House released the “Charting a Course for Success” that illustrated how far the United States was behind other countries in STEM education. It found that only 20% of high school grads were ready for the rigors of STEM majors. And how over the previous 15 years, the U.S. had produced only 10% of the world’s science and engineering grads. Since the founding of the Nation, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have been a source of inspirational discoveries and transformative technological advances, helping the United States develop the world's most competitive economy and preserving peace through strength. The pace of innovation is accelerating globally, and with it the competition for scientific and technical talent. Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and securit —depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem. - Charting a Course for Success That was one of the most news-worthy developments in recent years. It set the stage for many arguments behind STEM in the context of the global economy and supporting it through education. Job Outlook and Salary One of the most direct and powerful arguments for the importance of STEM education is how relevant STEM is in the workforce. In 2018, the Pew Research Center found that STEM employment had grown since 1990 (computer jobs increased 338%). What about now? All occupations are projected to increase 7.7% by 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Non-STEM occupations will increase 7.5% while STEM occupations will increase . The findings are even more pronounced in terms of salary. The median annual wage for all occupations is 40,020 and those in STEM occupations earn $89,780. Even areas like entrepreneurship see the same types of results. A from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) found that tech-based startups pay more than double the national average wage and nearly three times the average overall startup wage. They only make up 3.8% of businesses but capture a much larger share of business research and development investment (70.1%), research and development jobs (58.7%) and wages (8.1%), among other areas. Diversity and Skills An important detail in the passage from “Charting a Course for Success” comes toward the end of the final sentence: “Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and security—depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem.” Being inclusive is incredibly important once you understand how STEM occupations are such high-demand, high-paying positions. Unfortunately, however, diversity is a significant issue here. The Pew Research Center noted how women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented across many other STEM fields, especially in computer jobs and engineering. Black and Hispanic workers are also underrepresented in the STEM workforce. In the International Journal of STEM Education, authors noted how women are significantly underrepresented in STEM occupations. They make up of those working in STEM occupations and for women of color, representation is much lower — Hispanic, Asian and Black women receive less than 5% of STEM bachelor’s degrees in the U.S. Authors also pointed out how people of color overall are underrepresented in U.S.-based STEM leadership positions across industry, academia and the federal workforce. These issues are troubling when you consider how it undermines students’ opportunities to pursue high-demand, high-paying roles. Yet, it’s more than that. STEM education is about a teaching philosophy that naturally integrates critical thinking and language skills in a way that enriches any subject. Perhaps you’ve experienced or can imagine an education that integrates problem solving and engineering practices into any subject, where technology is seamlessly integrated throughout.

It would be inaccurate to assume that STEM education is merely instruction in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Rather, the idea is taken a step further. STEM education refers to the integration of the four subjects into a cohesive, interdisciplinary and applied learning approach. This isn’t academic theory—STEM education includes the appropriate real-world application and teaching methods. As a result, students in any subject can benefit from STEM education. That’s exactly why some educators and organizations refer to it as STEAM, which adds in arts or other creative subjects. They recognize just how powerful the philosophy behind STEM education can be for students. Why Is STEM Education Important? There are several layers to explore in discovering why STEM education is so important. Background In 2018, the White House released the “Charting a Course for Success” that illustrated how far the United States was behind other countries in STEM education. It found that only 20% of high school grads were ready for the rigors of STEM majors. And how over the previous 15 years, the U.S. had produced only 10% of the world’s science and engineering grads. Since the founding of the Nation, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have been a source of inspirational discoveries and transformative technological advances, helping the United States develop the world's most competitive economy and preserving peace through strength. The pace of innovation is accelerating globally, and with it the competition for scientific and technical talent. Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and securit —depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem. - Charting a Course for Success That was one of the most news-worthy developments in recent years. It set the stage for many arguments behind STEM in the context of the global economy and supporting it through education. Job Outlook and Salary One of the most direct and powerful arguments for the importance of STEM education is how relevant STEM is in the workforce. In 2018, the Pew Research Center found that STEM employment had grown since 1990 (computer jobs increased 338%). What about now? All occupations are projected to increase 7.7% by 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Non-STEM occupations will increase 7.5% while STEM occupations will increase . The findings are even more pronounced in terms of salary. The median annual wage for all occupations is 40,020 and those in STEM occupations earn $89,780. Even areas like entrepreneurship see the same types of results. A from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) found that tech-based startups pay more than double the national average wage and nearly three times the average overall startup wage. They only make up 3.8% of businesses but capture a much larger share of business research and development investment (70.1%), research and development jobs (58.7%) and wages (8.1%), among other areas. Diversity and Skills An important detail in the passage from “Charting a Course for Success” comes toward the end of the final sentence: “Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and security—depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem.” Being inclusive is incredibly important once you understand how STEM occupations are such high-demand, high-paying positions. Unfortunately, however, diversity is a significant issue here. The Pew Research Center noted how women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented across many other STEM fields, especially in computer jobs and engineering. Black and Hispanic workers are also underrepresented in the STEM workforce. In the International Journal of STEM Education, authors noted how women are significantly underrepresented in STEM occupations. They make up of those working in STEM occupations and for women of color, representation is much lower — Hispanic, Asian and Black women receive less than 5% of STEM bachelor’s degrees in the U.S. Authors also pointed out how people of color overall are underrepresented in U.S.-based STEM leadership positions across industry, academia and the federal workforce.

0,steampoweredfamily,What is STEM Education? and Why is it important?,https://www.steampoweredfamily.com/what-is-stem/,"STEM education is far more than just sticking those subject titles together. It’s a philosophy of education that embraces teaching skills and subjects in an a way that resembles real life. STEM fields of work have also become some of the fastest growing areas of expertise in the world. You can also view this video on the . Why is STEM Education Important? The key component of STEM and STEAM is integration. Instead of teaching disciplines in independent subject silos, classroom lessons are well rounded, project and , with a focus on interdisciplinary learning. STEM and STEAM align with the way we work and problem solve in our daily lives. Making it an exceptional way of instructing and creating a powerful learning environment. With STEM we are teaching skills the way they will be used in the workforce, and the real world. Rarely does a job require only one skill set like math. Picture an architect, they use science, math, engineering and technology to do their jobs. The subjects do not work on their own, instead they are woven together in practical and seamless ways allowing the architect to design complex buildings. This is the power of developing STEM skills for all students, not just those interested in STEM careers. STEM and STEAM are not new, they are simply ways of understanding and applying an integrated form of learning that resembles real life. Instead of teaching math as separate from science, they can be taught together in a way that shows how the knowledge from those two fields compliment and support each other. Why add the A (arts) in STEAM? The addition of Arts to STEM to create STEAM is about incorporating creative thinking and applied arts in real situations. Art isn’t just about working in a studio. Art is about discovering and creating ingenious ways of problem solving, integrating principles or presenting information. Picture an architect, they use engineering, math, technology, science and arts to create stunning buildings and structures. Many people feel that adding the A is unnecessary and that the application of creativity and arts is a natural part of STEM, but others like to highlight it. For elementary aged children, in particular, I like to include the A to ensure that facet of learning doesn’t get forgotten in our lessons. Whether you prefer STEM or STEAM the underlying principles and practices are very much the same, it’s about integration of the pillars: Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math to provide tremendous opportunities for all students. How Will STEM Improve Student Learning? Simply put, STEM reflects real life. Jobs in the real world are interdisciplinary. We need to educate children in how subjects integrate and work together. They need to develop diverse skills sets and a passion for exploration and growth. We don’t need children to memorize random facts anymore. We have so many facts at our finger tips now. When I’m having a debate with someone, I can pull out my phone and in seconds have all the facts. Education is no longer about memorizing facts. Instead it is about learning how to think critically and evaluate information. How to apply knowledge, research and skills to problem solve. Skills need to be taught in an applied way, as part of a greater whole, rather than the traditional approach of individual subject silos. STEM embraces the 4 C’s identified as key in 21st Century education: Creativity, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Communication. Most importantly, by incorporating and an to suit students of various needs, . And the most important gift an education should give a student is a love of learning. What Are Some Problems With STEM Education? One of the biggest concerns I hear from people about STEM education or trying to run a STEM program is the lack of resources. Funding for the newest technology, training in how to use the new technology, plus the knowledge of how to use it effectively as a learning tool, are all areas where teachers struggle. If you are teaching at home or have a healthy budget, STEM Kits can be an amazing and easy way to get started with STEM. We love using STEM Kits. They have them for all ages and cover so many interests. . Another area where a lot of teachers struggle is with a system that is focuses on assessment and grades rather than a program that fosters innovation, creativity, and problem solving skills. These achievements are not something that can be easily boxed up and assessed. Developing STEM lesson plans can also be a challenge when first getting started. We have a free STEM lesson planner available to our mailing list members. Sadly, another thing I hear a lot is that some teachers are simply not interested in learning how to teach STEM and STEAM. They prefer to stay in the silos. Keeping each of the stem subjects isolated into their own lessons. How To Get Your Kids Interested In STEM? STEM aligns so much with the way children’s minds learn and work from a very early age. Even before your kids enter elementary school, you can start building their STEM"
0,geeksforgeeks,What is STEM Education? and Why is it important?,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-stem-education/,"STEM education primarily focuses on hands-on and problem-based learning methodology.

Motivates ExperimentingIn the last couple of decades, it has been noticed that STEM education provides a healthy environment and encourages students to try new things. Children who are part of STEM education learn the importance of failure and how to tackle it without getting affected. 3. Teamwork STEM education is best for and it helps students from every level to work together. They come together and find solutions to the problem discuss with each other, record data, give presentations, write reports, etc. In the end, they come to know the importance of working with each other and, flourish in a complete team-building environment. 4. Boosts CuriosityThis is one of the most vital features of STEM education. Students who are made habitual of this type of education since childhood, develop curiosity and innovation as their regular habits. This type of education enhances the critical way of thinking and empowers them to ask questions. 5. Enhances Problem Solving Skills With the enhancement of critical thinking, students also learn problem-solving skills. By adapting STEM education from an early age children learn the ways of examining problems. Children can also create amazing plans to solve problems. Also, it helps students to look at the bigger picture and not from the smaller aspect.Objectives Of STEM Education:These are the objectives of STEM education, take a look:1. Meeting Demand For Highly Skilled ProfessionalsTo stay afloat in the market, companies hire the best talent pool to help them stay competitive and relevant. People with 21st-century skills as well as STEM skills are the most sought-after. According to many researchers, there is a rise in professions that require STEM skills. Besides, who doesn’t want skilled people that would require very less time to adapt to the new environment? Therefore, stem education is playing a crucial role in determining the future of the youth and their employability.2. Skill DevelopmentLiving in the digital age it is pertinent to say that technology has become an integral part of living therefore the students skilled in digital technology are going to be beneficial. Having faced the coronavirus lockdown almost every student was forced to switch to online platforms to impart knowledge. Students are now accustomed to learning online in the comfort of their place. Likewise, STEM education also helps students develop skills like critical thinking, creative thinking, digital literacy, spatial reasoning, etc.3. Helps To Create Equality There is no gender of subjects. However, people attach genders to subjects as well as to occupations. This is one of the major reasons behind the skewed gender ratio as one advance towards executive and leadership roles. This gender gap can be met by introducing STEM courses at an earlier age. Girls along with boys can then develop 21st-century skills and increase their employability rate. Furthermore, providing equal opportunities for each student towards exploring technologies through an integrated and interdisciplinary educational approach will take the world to the next level.Components of STEM Education :#Attentive LearningLearning attentively is quite a vital component of STEM education as it encourages students to think deeply and create a few assumptions in order to memorize things properly. #Personalized System of LearningIn this, there are various methods of learning such as the shift method which is provided by the instructor in this the students have a choice of learning things at their pace, choosing subjects according to their choice, and giving exams accordingly. #Problem-Based LearningThis is a simple way in which students collect various data from the things they come across in their daily life and analyze it. They can come up with different solutions by applying scientific, mathematical, or technological approaches. #Connecting with a Bigger Level of CommunityStudents are made extroverts who can connect with a large number of people and share their ideas with them. It also helps them in learning several new things thus making them ambitious along with taking a look at various perspectives. Pros and Cons of STEM Education:Here are some of the prominent pros and cons of STEM education listed below:Pros of STEM Education:Widens career opportunitiesDevelops resilienceDevelops communication, critical thinking, cognitive skills, etc.Allows to understand the practical application of conceptsHelps in preparing students for future workforceHelps in promoting gender equalityCons of STEM EducationNo proper guidelines/set of protocols Might be costlyRequires a significant amount of timeWhy is STEM Important in Early Childhood Education?Schools play a vital role in imparting knowledge to students. After all, a person spends nearly 1/5th of his/her life going to school. STEM education focuses on building habits that will help children throughout their lives, from critical thinking skills, problem-solving and creative thinking to computation and interpersonal skills. They learn how to apply all of these to their daily life for building a better world around them.1. Elementary SchoolOne might think that students under 5 years of age can do little when it comes to STEM. However, researchers have found that children in this age bracket are exceptionally quick learners and exhibit great creative and technical abilities. Hence, at this stage, a brief introduction to STEM courses along with future career options are discussed. Its primary focus is on standards-based structure, inquiry-based and real-world problem-based learning, connecting all four STEM subjects. The objective is to arouse students’ interest and curiosity to pursue these courses without forcing them.2. Middle SchoolThe courses are designed in such a way that the students are curious to learn more. The objective here is to make them learn ‘how’ to learn not ‘what’ to learn. This enables them to pursue their interests early on while also being aware of the career options available to them after taking STEM courses.3. High SchoolStudents are in their teens during High School. Therefore, this is the time when they are searching for their identity and trying to make career choices. Hence, the programs focus on the application of the subjects in a challenging and rigorous manner. Along with that students are also guided for post-Secondary Education and employment.Making Sense of ‘STEM Education’ in K-12 Contexts:K-12 education is a short form used for classes from kindergarten to 12th grade and STEM has a lot of importance during those years. K-12 STEM education keeps children connected with the real world from a small age. It also helps in motivating students to learn new things, improves their interest, and makes them persistent in completing their tasks. The incorporation of STEM education in K-12 increases the standard of the things taught and helps children to choose careers in STEM-related fields.

They are the ones who follow a specialized course in science and technology subjects as preparation for college science education, as well as post-graduate degrees. The difference between STEM & STEAM The main is the inclusion of the arts in the latter. Advocates of that adding arts subjects into a technical and scientific curriculum makes students more prepared and adaptable to the real world; that it encourages creativity and a more well-rounded perspective, which can be vital in . What does STEM mean in school? Depending on your jurisdiction or country, STEM education is either optional or compulsory for all high school students. In some countries, especially the more advanced and industrialized countries, STEM education starts at the elementary level; some aspects of it may even be integrated in preschool. For example, since the 1970s and is a pioneer in educational reform. But not all schools or countries have the technical capabilities and infrastructure to fully implement a compulsory science-oriented curriculum in their basic education programs. It would mean following higher standards in instructions, laboratory facilities, and academic requirements for students. Plus, not all students have the right aptitude for or interest in STEM subjects. STEM education is an interdisciplinary but integrated approach aimed at training students to become future scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technology innovators. Although there are other career opportunities that are open to STEM students, the curriculum is oriented towards scientific advancements. It would mean specially trained teachers who have the skills and academic knowledge in certain scientific fields. A school that offers STEM education must have highly qualified faculty and updated facilities to provide the right training for students. What is a STEM education? STEM education is a specialized curriculum in the K-12 program intended to prepare students for careers in various scientific disciplines. The U.S. formalized the STEM curriculum in 2001, when the acronym was changed from SMET (Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology), which it was originally called by the National Science Foundation. Historically, the origin of the idea of science-focused education dates back to the 1950s in the early years of the Cold War era. This is especially true when the Russians successfully launched the first ever artificial satellite into orbit, the Sputnik 1, in 1957. The U.S. government and the public in general became more motivated to out-compete the Russians. That meant the came into focus and became an ideological battleground. It was in the 1950s that federal funding for K-12 education began. Meanwhile, the National Science Foundation (NSF) was established during this decade. The primary mandate of the NSF is to “promote basic scientific research and education”. However, it was not until the term of President Barack Obama that a much-needed boost in STEM"

This gap and the desire to gain global leadership in the increasingly necessary field of STEM subjects has inspired more attempts to reform and improve STEM education. STEM in the 21st century Infographic of projected STEM job increases. Credit to U.S. Department of Education. “ Leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today—especially in science, technology, engineering and math."" ” —President Barack Obama, September 16, 2010 As mentioned above, the United States government and various research groups have reported a decline in STEM performance. One of these groups, STEMconnector, has published several reports indicating a need for more Americans to move into STEM fields. During a 2013 STEM symposium at Capitol Hill, STEMconnector's director, Edie Fraser, said that 2.5 million STEM jobs were not being filled at that time, and that her group projected 71 percent of new STEM jobs would require a computer science background. The published its own article discussing STEM education. The chart to the right includes the Department of Education's projections for STEM-related job increases. In this article, the Department of Education disclosed the following information: ""Only 16 percent of American high school seniors are proficient in mathematics and interested in a STEM career."" The United States ranked ""25th in mathematics and 17th in science among industrialized nations."" The Obama administration pledged to work towards the following goals: Develop, recruit and retain over 100,000 new and excellent STEM teachers Motivate an additional 1 million students to graduate from college STEM programs Attract underrepresented groups to STEM fields, including female, black and Hispanic students STEMconnector study STEM trends by gender, 1997-2016. Credit to STEMconnector. STEM trends by ethnicity, 1997-2016. Credit to STEMconnector. STEMconnector is one of the largest organizations dedicated to documenting and improving STEM education and related programs. The organization released a study for the 2012-2013 school year examining current trends, provided projections for future trends, and highlighted other issues within STEM education. The charts to the right measure STEM interest among high school students. The chart on the top compares interest by gender, and the lower chart compares interest by ethnicity. Although both charts show fluctuating interest in the past, STEMconnector shows a projected increase from 2011 and on. It is important to note that these charts only show interest in STEM subjects. The numbers on the chart do not necessarily reflect the number of students who progress into STEM careers. Gender The gender chart shows a large gap between male and female students interested in STEM subjects. Although the size of this gap stayed relatively constant throughout the years measured, the gap was projected to increase from 2011 and on. This projected increase has prompted many STEM groups to focus on attracting more female students to science. Data also show that even female students who are interested in STEM subjects are largely attracted to biology, chemistry, marine biology and science. Computer science and engineering are two of the least popular fields for women in STEM. Ethnicity The ethnicity chart shows a different yet still significant issue. Asian students have maintained significantly more interest in STEM subjects than all other ethnic groups in America. American Indians have had the second highest interest since 2002. Black and Hispanic students have consistently had the two lowest ratings of interest since 2004. Because of this, some experts believe that one of the best ways to increase STEM interest is to focus recruitment efforts on underrepresented ethnic groups. STEMconnector argues that special effort should be given to recruiting black students, as they are the only ethnic group to experience constant overall decline since 2000 with the exception of a brief rise from 2004 to 2007. Initiatives Educate to Innovate President Obama during the 2011 State of the Union, one occasion when he spoke about STEM education. The ""Educate to Innovate"" campaign of 2009, organized by the Obama administration, applies to a wide range of initiatives all designed to improve STEM education throughout the country. These initiatives include grants, awareness programs and education reform efforts. Some of the most significant gains made by the campaign have been in military-affiliated schools. One year after Educate to Innovate began, military-partnered schools noted an 85 percent increase in qualifying AP test scores in math and science, 10 times the national average. By 2012, those schools maintained test performance that was still at least six times greater than the national average. One of President Obama's goals for the Educate to Innovate campaign was to inspire other groups to fund or support STEM education in an ""all-hands-on-deck"" approach. CEOs of over 100 different companies have worked towards supporting new programs, including ""Change the Equation."" Another goal of the Educate to Innovate campaign is to prepare 100,000 new STEM educators by 2021. Similar to the Change the Equation organization, over 150 different groups have come together to create ""100kin10."" As mentioned above, one of the major goals of STEM improvement programs is to recruit more women, girls and minorities to enter into these subjects. President Obama has worked to create more influential role models for girls interested in STEM subjects by naming female leaders for certain STEM organizations. Examples include ""Department of Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar, and National Science Foundation Acting Director Cora Marrett."" Many of the programs inspired by the Educate to Innovate campaign, such as Change the Equation, name recruiting more minorities as one of their goals. Change the Equation Change the Equation logo. As a direct result of the Educate to Innovate campaign, Change the Equation was launched in 2010 by over 100 CEOs from various businesses and organizations. Change the Equation, or CTEq, pools the resources of these CEOs and generates additional programs to improve STEM education. CTEq has done the following since it began in 2010: Published a report called Vital Signs that measures the STEM conditions in each state and the District of Columbia. This report is regularly updated. Launched ""STEMworks,"" a database of STEM programs deemed most effective as determined by a rubric, which was also generated by CTEq. Designed iON Future, a suite of games designed to foster interest in STEM subjects among middle school-aged students. Recorded and presented interviews of inspiring STEM professionals to students in order to generate more interest. 100kin10 100kin10 logo. Started in 2011, 100kin10 is a movement that strives to generate more interest and incentive to train 100,000 new STEM educators by 2021. One of its approaches is to improve STEM education overall. By doing so, more students are likely to maintain interest in STEM subjects throughout their education careers. The hope behind this is that the interest will lead to more people interested in teaching STEM subjects. More teachers with passion for STEM subjects will motivate more students to pursue STEM fields, and the cycle will continue. The movement also strives to change how teachers are trained, hired and paid so that more excellent STEM teachers enter and stay in the education field. The organization has also raised over $30 million as of 2014. This movement also hopes to prove that a nongovernmental organization can affect change without the help of the federal government. Objections and alternatives Although there is a definite and recorded need for qualified professionals in STEM fields, some argue that the need is not as severe as the above programs imply. This may be because some feel there are more pressing needs, that the need for STEM professionals is overstated by the studies conducted so far, or that there are other alternative programs that require more attention. An exaggerated crisis The most significant objection raised by STEM opponents is that the STEM crisis, which has motivated the spending of millions of dollars on STEM advocacy programs, is grossly exaggerated. Opponents cite conflicting data; while many studies insist that there will be more STEM jobs than STEM professionals, there are other reports that state the opposite. Opponents also believe that many of these studies calling for more STEM workers are too vague. There are no concise definitions of what makes a ""STEM worker,"" so it is difficult to ascertain how much education one must obtain. As such, there are no clear weaknesses in STEM"

This is the theory behind STEM education. By exposing students to STEM and giving them opportunities to explore STEM-related concepts, they will develop a passion for it and, hopefully, pursue a job in a STEM field. So what is STEM? STEM stands for science, technology, engineering, and math. These four symbols represent the different areas of STEM education. STEM education integrates concepts that are usually taught as separate subjects in different classes and emphasizes the application of knowledge to real-life situations. A lesson or unit in a STEM class is typically based around finding a solution to a real-world problem and tends to emphasize project-based learning. A variation of STEM is STEAM, which includes an 'A' for art and design. Artistic design is becoming an important part of STEM education since creativity is an essential part of innovation. Many STEM lessons involve building models and simulating situations. A good STEM lesson ensures that students understand the connection to the real world. A sample STEM lesson would start with showing pictures of large barges carrying crates. Then students would experiment with different materials and computer-aided designs in an attempt to build a model boat capable of holding large amounts of pennies. Math would be incorporated by demanding specific measurements for the design and requiring the students to keep within a certain budget for their materials. This experiment models how real-world engineers and scientists try to improve the efficiency of the current shipping designs. STEM education could take place in a separate STEM class or be incorporated into practically any subject and grade level. Of course science and math classes would be able to directly implement STEM-related lessons. In a social studies class learning about the industrial revolution, however, students may design their own assembly line. Or, in an English class, students may be keeping a journal about their thinking and research processes while designing a realistic bridge from a fictional novel. Careers in STEM-related fields are vast and diverse. They obviously include careers in the pharmacy, energy, programming, and engineering fields. However, STEM careers may also take the form of a physician's assistant, network communications expert, or agricultural professional. Finance, risk analysis, and even athletic training have elements of STEM in them. And, of course, teaching is an essential career that stimulates the STEM fields!

Importance of STEMThe U.S. led the world in STEM fields until recently, but today, fewer students are graduating high school competent in science, technology, engineering and math. According to the U.S. Department of Education, as of 2014, only 16% of high school seniors are proficient in math and wish to pursue a STEM degree. Yet, despite this lack of interest, STEM is all around us. It is a part of everyone's daily lives, from the phones we talk on to the cars we drive and the doctors we visit. seeks to raise students' awareness of how STEM fields affect their daily lives and also seeks to excite them and prepare them for future careers in a STEM-related field. Many new jobs that will be available for students are in the STEM-related fields. It is essential for the survival of the U.S. economy to have people capable of fulfilling these jobs. Ensuring students' interests and competencies is also important for the country as a whole in order to stay competitive in the world market. STEM StandardsAs of 2014, there are no specific national STEM standards, but the Next Generation Science Standards were written to include technology, engineering and math. Common Core, the education standards followed by most states, does not include STEM. However, most individual states have written their own standards and guidelines regarding STEM, which vary from state to state. As of 2014 there are no national requirements for standardized testing related to STEM in public schools, and there are no national requirements to include STEM, but that could change due to the formation of the Committee on STEM Education by President Obama. Lesson SummarySTEM stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics and seeks to increase student competency in these areas, as well as interest in future careers in STEM-related fields by studying real-world problems and solving them through project-based learning. An increase in STEM education and students prepared for STEM-related careers is essential to the survival of our nation and its economy. Though no specific national STEM standards or requirements exist as of 2014, many individual states have written their own standards.

In 2001 the US National Science Foundation introduced the acronym STEM. Since then the name has become hugely important in education, careers, and even politics. Chances are you will have heard it as a parent. But what does STEM stand for in education and school, and is it important? What does STEM stand for? STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics in an educational context. STEM-related learning is important in schools and at home, as it provides an opportunity for children to learn about topics and disciplines that will serve them well in later life, particularly for in-demand new job roles. Whilst the majority of STEM related activities are spoken about in an educational and school-based context, parents also have a large part to play. As parents ourselves we believe it’s important to create opportunities and environments that encourage STEM learning. That’s why we run a large program of summer camps and term-time courses which offer STEM-related subjects, but in a fun and engaging environment. What does STEM education mean? STEM education is available in many schools, but not all of them are able to deliver an effective curriculum and learning environment due to a lack of teaching skills and resources. In the 2012 report Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education: A Primer (), STEM education was defined as: “Teaching and learning in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. It typically includes educational activities across all grade levels—from pre-school to post-doctorate—in both formal (e.g., classrooms) and informal (e.g., afterschool programs) settings.” What is the STEM concept in education? You probably recall being at school yourselves when the teacher taught you something and you questioned how the topic would be relevant to later life. That’s where the STEM concept is different. For example, let’s say your child wanted to be a video game designer when they grow up. What do you think would make them more interested in this career path? It would be things like taking part in a class led by a video game programmer or having hands on experience of developing their own game… both of which are available at the FunTech summer camps (). By actually experiencing video game design, your child will have their interest peaked which could lead on to an exciting and fruitful career. This is the concept of STEM education. It’s all about an exposure to a STEM subject with real-world learning where the child can apply their knowledge to solve real-world problems. By doing so, they will develop a passion for the subject and then possibly end up having a job in a STEM-related industry. Why is STEM important? STEM jobs are growing at a faster rate than non-STEM careers and workers have higher rates of pay than non-STEM educated people. Children that excel in science, technology, engineering and mathematics are set to play a huge role in the growth of the UK economy and the country’s future. STEM education encourages critical thinking, improves technological literacy, and leads to the next generation of business leaders and innovators. Children that learn STEM effectively now will be the adults that will lead the innovation to sustain our future economy. STEM education in schools is critical in developing children’s interests in pursuing these types of jobs. However, our schools and teachers can’t always carry this burden entirely, so it’s important for parents to also encourage learning. You can do that with extra-curricular activities such as the FunTech camps and home-based learning. Children that learn at our tech camps will always be given projects to take home with them, so the learning doesn’t simply end once they leave us. How a STEM education can help your child in the future Chances to earn more: recent research by the US Chamber of Commerce Foundation found that those in STEM jobs will earn almost twice as much as other jobs. Possibilities to experience the world: there are shortages of qualified people in STEM roles around the world. By having a STEM background, your child could be in demand not just in the UK, but in other exciting global locations. What type of jobs can STEM education lead to? By encouraging your child to embrace STEM subjects it could lead to them having a rewarding and productive career in industries diverse as engineering, sciences, and technology. Here’s a breakdown of the type of career possibilities STEM could result in. Science Astronomy Anatomy Biology Chemistry Earth Science Ecology Environmental Studies Geology Medicine Physics Technology 3D Printing Automotive Technicians Computer Science Computer Technician Construction Technology Drafting Electrician HVAC Specialist Information Technology Marine Architecture Metal Fabrication Plumbing Power Plant Operations Video Game Design Engineering Aerospace Engineering Biochemical Engineering Biomedical Engineering Chemical Engineering Civil Engineering Computer Engineering Electrical Engineering Environmental Engineering Industrial Engineering Manufacturing Engineering Materials Engineering Mechanical Engineering Robotics Maths Applied Mathematics Biomathematics Computer Mathematics Cryptography Finance Maths Education Mathematical Modelling Risk Management Specialists Statistics What should you do if your school doesn’t have a strong STEM program? Unfortunately, not all schools have a particularly strong approach to STEM education. Even if your child’s school is one of the better ones, it’s still important to encourage additional learning outside of the curriculum. At FunTech we run a series of as well as classes for children aged 7 to 12. We also run term-time classes and virtual learning of STEM-related subjects. All of our summer camps and classes are designed with fun at the forefront, underpinned with an expert tutor-led program. The classes are as diverse as 3D game design, 3D modelling, computer coding, robotics, and touch typing. Why book a kid’s STEM summer camp with FunTech? Our summer day camps are ideal for children who want to learn. They are also ideal for parents who want to help their children possibly have a brighter future with a STEM-based summer activity.

The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant. Composite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic and terrestrial . Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively. Photosynthesis ( FOH-tə-SINTH-ə-sis) is a biological process used by many cellular organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in organic compounds that can later be metabolized through cellular respiration to fuel the organism's activities. The term usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, where oxygen is produced as a byproduct, and some of the chemical energy produced is stored in carbohydrate molecules such as sugars, starch and cellulose, which are synthesized from endergonic reaction of carbon dioxide with water. Most plants, algae and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth. Some also perform , which use to split as a instead of water, and is produced as a byproduct instead of oxygen. such as also perform a type of non- anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler and its are used to absorb green light and power to directly synthesize (ATP). Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis evolved on Earth, going back as far as the , preceding that of cyanobacteria (see ). Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by called that contain or . In plants, these proteins are (a derivative that absorbs the red and blue of , thus reflecting a green color) held inside called , which are most abundant in cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the . In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the ""energy currency"" of cells. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the . In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as . In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the are used to achieve the same end. The first photosynthetic organisms probably early in the and most likely used such as or , rather than water, as sources of electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the they produced contributed directly to the , which rendered the possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 , which is about eight times the current . Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion (91–104 Pg , or billion metric tons), of carbon into per year. That plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air, soil, and water – was first discovered in 1779 by . Photosynthesis is vital for climate processes, as it captures carbon dioxide from the air and then binds carbon in plants and further in soils and harvested products. alone are estimated to bind 3,825 Tg (teragrams) or 3.825 Pg (petagrams) of carbon dioxide every year, i.e. 3.825 billion metric tons. Overview Main article: Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar. Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.[] Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called ; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into . Carbon fixation is an reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of : while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's . Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different .[] The general for photosynthesis as first proposed by is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + light energy → [CH2O] + 2Aoxidizedelectrondonor + H2Owater Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen + H2Owater This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the and a product of the , but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation: CO2carbondioxide + H2O water + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2 oxygen Other processes substitute other compounds (such as ) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to : The equation for this reaction is: CO2carbondioxide + (AsO3−3)arsenite + photonslight energy → (AsO3−4)arsenate + COcarbonmonoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions) Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier and the energy-storage molecule . During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave or, more specifically, far-red radiation. Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic membranes and organelles Main articles: and Chloroplast ultrastructure:outer membraneintermembrane spaceinner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)stroma (aqueous fluid)thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)thylakoid membranegranum (stack of thylakoids)thylakoid (lamella)starchribosomeplastidial DNAplastoglobule (drop of lipids) In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in . In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself. However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called , or bunched up into round called intracytoplasmic membranes. These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb. In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in called . A typical contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and complexes of the photosynthetic system. Plants absorb light primarily using the . The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as and . Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as , , and in , in (rhodophytes) and in and resulting in a wide variety of colors. These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a . Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called . Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and , such as many and species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the , can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant that protects the leaf from excessive of water and decreases the absorption of or to minimize . The transparent layer allows light to pass through to the mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.

The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is: 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Not all of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of present. For example, in green plants, the resembles the for and with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms. Z scheme The ""Z scheme"" In plants, occur in the of the where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic. In the non-cyclic reaction, the are captured in the light-harvesting of by and other (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called . The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), a is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during , whereas is a product of the terminal reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in . There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that . The electron is then passed along a chain of to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the NADP with a H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends. The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction. Water photolysis Main articles: and Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of are replaced by transfer from , whose electrons come from electron transport through . Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic and four ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four ions and a calcium ion; this binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for , including photosynthetic organisms. Light-independent reactions Calvin cycle Main articles: and In the (or ""dark"") reactions, the captures from the and, in a process called the , uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is: 128 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material , the precursors for and biosynthesis, or as a fuel in . The latter occurs not only in plants but also in when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a . The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which combines with a five-carbon sugar, , to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, , also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of and produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to . This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde () or, more generically, as phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus ""recycled"" often condense to form phosphates, which ultimately yield , and , as well as and . The sugars produced during carbon yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of and . Carbon concentrating mechanisms On land Main articles: , , and Overview of . (This image mistakenly shows lactic acid instead of pyruvate, and all the species ending in ""-ate"" are shown as unionized acids, such as malic acid and so on.) In hot and dry conditions, plants close their to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of by the activity of and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions. Plants that use the carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called , creating the four-carbon organic acid . Oxaloacetic acid or synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized cells where the enzyme and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon . The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and, thus, the of the leaf. C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation; however, the evolution of C4 in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of . , which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful CCM in its own right. , such as and most , also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called (CAM). In contrast to C4 metabolism, which spatially separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of via carboxylation of to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants. accumulating plants, such as and , show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide () to photosynthetic cells when are partially or totally closed. This process was named . Under stress conditions (e.g. water deficit) oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an and the produced CO2 can support the reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by . Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known and pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere. In water possess , which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, , located within the carboxysome releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO−3). Before the CO2 diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCO−3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO−3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes. in and also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO. Order and kinetics The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages: Stage Description Time scale 1 Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll (thylakoid membranes) to 2 Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions (thylakoid membranes) to 3 Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (thylakoid membranes) to 4 Carbon fixation and export of stable products to Efficiency Main article: Plants usually convert light into with a of 3–6%. Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) re-emitted as at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers. Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%. By comparison, convert light into at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices. Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield. The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C3 plants. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks. For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction. It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together. Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2, and of ΔH2O using reliable methods CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/(m2/s), parts per million or volume per million and H2O is commonly measured in mmol/(m2/s) or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, ""A"" or carbon assimilation, ""E"" or transpiration, ""gs"" or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO2. However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations. Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response. Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms. While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC to replace Ci. The estimation of CO2 at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, or CC, becomes possible with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system. Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed. A phenomenon known as increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a referred to as an , which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously ""choose"" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic ""hop"". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.

Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used and as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various and other as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly at . Fossils of what are thought to be photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago. The main source of in the derives from , and its appearance is sometimes referred to as the . Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in , became important during the era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is to molecular oxygen in the . Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, ) Several groups of animals have formed relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in , and . It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes. In addition, a few marine and also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see ). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. Some of the genes from the plant have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive. An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular , prokaryotic-type , and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center. The suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by ) by early cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like , chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in . DNA in chloroplasts codes for proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.

Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the ""red lineages"" and the ""green lineages"". The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A , remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga). Some dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are and practice to various degrees. Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a of extant (formerly called blue-green algae), which are the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier. Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen. Available evidence from geobiological studies of (>2500 Ma) indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal of oxygen throughout the (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of .[] joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on near the end of the , but only with the (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to as in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the of marine algae. Experimental history Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century. Portrait of by , c. 1674 began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself. , a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly air. He then showed that the air that had been ""injured"" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant. In 1779, repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours. In 1796, , a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined. Refinements made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction, in which hydrogen (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide. discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll ""a"", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll ""a"" with most of the available chlorophyll ""b"", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry. thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like , or after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction: 2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH2 + O2 A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. and used to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water. works in his photosynthesis laboratory. and , along with , elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the , but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle. –winning scientist was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain. and discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration. In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of in vivo was presented by using intact cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent formation. In 1954, et al. discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated with the help of P32. and discovered that chlorophyll ""a"" will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll ""a"" (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series. Development of the concept In 1893, proposed two terms, photosyntax and photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light. The term photosynthesis is derived from the phōs (, gleam) and sýnthesis (, arranging together), while another word that he designated was photosyntax, from sýntaxis (, configuration). Over time, the term photosynthesis came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term. C3 : C4 photosynthesis research In the late 1940s at the , the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists , Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques. The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight. Later in 1958–1963 at , field grown was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be saturated at near full sunlight. This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of and uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species. In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane. Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light. The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986. These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate. Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants. Factors The is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants. There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis[] and several corollary factors. The four main are: Light and Water absorption . Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis. Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature See also: spectra of free chlorophyll a (blue) and b (red) in a solvent. The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment–protein interactions. The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life. The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space. In the early 20th century, and investigated the effects of light intensity () and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance. At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased. These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, reactions are not affected by . However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical' temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of . Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called . This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center. Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Photorespiration As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. , the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called , uses energy, but does not produce sugars. RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons: One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the . Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce (NH3), which is able to out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen. A highly simplified summary is: 2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3 The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

The product glucose acts as a vital source of food for the plant. Carbon dioxide, water and light are all needed for photosynthesis to take place.Game - light intensity and photosynthesisPlay an Atomic Labs experiment to explore how light intensity affects levels of photosynthesis.You can also .to-topBack to topPhotosynthesis activityPlay this game to see how a seed or a plant is affected by changing how much water, sunlight and carbon dioxide it gets.to-topBack to topWhat is photosynthesis?Photosynthesis takes place inside plant cells in small objects called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This absorbs the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. Plants and algae can only carry out photosynthesis in the light.A diagram of a plant cell to show its main componentsPlants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the Sun.The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch and plant oils, which are used as an energy store. This energy can be released by respiration.Video - Creating photosynthesisThe head groundsman at Derby County FC discusses how he uses knowledge of photosynthesis to maintain the pitch.Video TranscriptupdownIt's hugely important these pitches are absolutely pristine for the fans, the spectators, for the players, it's incredibly important. We have to have a safe surface so they're not getting injured, missing a shot, costing your team a chance for a win, the chance for a trophy.I'm Nathan Scarff, and I'm the Head Groundsman in Derby County Football Club.Working inside a stadium, we have a really big shade issue. The darkest area in this pitch will never see any sunlight. The plants struggle to photosynthesise naturally, so we use the lights to effectively synthetically induce the photosynthesis process and create the growth, so it gives the plant a lot of light energy and also some heat as well to encourage growth.We are looking for just a healthy plant, something that's strong, something that's durable, something that would recover well. The sciences that we use is predominately biology, we have a variety of measuring tools, we'll measure the moisture, the length of the grass, the hardness of the surface, everything is about producing absolute uniformity.The first year that we had these lights, we won the award for best pitch in the championship. You do take a lot of pride away on what you do.Can you answer these questions based on the video?1. Derby County FC has a very big shade issue with regards to the growth of their grass pitch. What do they use to overcome this problem?2. Name three qualities of the pitch that is measured to ensure healthy, durable grass to play football on?Show answerArtificial lighting.Moisture, length of the grass and hardness of the surface.These are the things that plants need for photosynthesis:Carbon dioxideWaterLight (a source of energy)These are the things that plants make by photosynthesis:GlucoseOxygenThe word equation for photosynthesis in the presence of light and chlorophyll is:Carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygento-topBack to topWhy is photosynthesis important?Photosynthesis provides organisms with oxygen, a gas that many living things need. Oxygen is a product of photosynthesis and is needed for respiration. All organisms respire to release energy and to stay alive. Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would come to an end, as almost every food chain depends on it either directly or indirectly. Producers such as algae, seaweed, grasses and phytoplankton all require photosynthesis to make their own food.Photosynthesis brings about a balance in the ecosystem as it decreases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Together with other processes such as respiration and combustion, it can help to maintain levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Without photosynthesis we wouldn’t have fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum, as these were formed from photosynthetic processes. These non-renewable sources were made by the breakdown of older plants.Plant products such as timber, rubber and oil also require photosynthesis to be made.If a plant cannot photosynthesise, it will dieto-topBack to topPlants and animals working togetherThe composition of the atmosphere has changed since the Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago. Natural processes, such as photosynthesis, have contributed to maintaining the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, required for survival.Plants release oxygen into the atmosphere as a by-product of photosynthesis and processes such as respiration and decomposition release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These processes work symbiotically, where plants and animals depend on each other to benefit from this. Plants need the carbon dioxide released by respiration and decomposition, whereas animals need the oxygen released by plants from photosynthesis. This cycle helps maintain the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.Video - Golden jellyfishProfessor Brian Cox sees photosynthesis in action, investigating a unique type of jellyfishVideo TranscriptupdownProfessor Brian Cox: All life depends on the flow of energy, which gets passed from one life-form to another. And there is one creature that embodies more than most just how that happens. This is the Golden Jellyfish.A unique subspecies only found in this one lake, on this one island, in the tiny Micronesian republic of Palau. Golden Jellyfish have evolved to do something that very few other animals can do.' It really is incredible. As far as you can see, all the way down, till the light vanishes, there are jellyfish. And you can see they've congregated in the sun. If you go over there, to where the lake's in shade there are just none. And then in this pool of light beneath the sun, there are millions of them. Beautifully elegant things just floating around.This lake is home to over 20 million jellyfish, whose success comes down to a remarkable adaptation. Their bodies play host to thousands of other organisms. Photosynthetic algae that harvest energy directly from sunlight. And once harvested, it's passed on to the jellyfish to use.The energy flows from sun, to algae, to jellyfish.' The ones at the surface are gently turning and, the reason they do that is to give all their algae an equal dose of sunlight. 'And it's not just their anatomy that's adapted to harvest solar energy. Every morning, as the sun rises the jellyfish begin to swim towards the east.' And as the sun tracks across the sky, they move back again towards the west where they spend their night. So, the jellyfish have this beautiful, intimate, and complex relationship with the position of the sun in the sky. 'As sunlight is captured by their algae it's converted into chemical energy. Energy they use to combine simple molecules, water and carbon dioxide, to produce a far more complex one: glucose. Once absorbed by the jellyfish, glucose, and other molecules, not only power their daily voyage across the lake, they provide the basic building blocks the jellyfish use to grow the elegant and complex structures of their bodies.So, the jellyfish, through their symbiotic algae, absorb the light, the energy, from the sun, and they use it to, well to live, to power their processes of life. And that's true, directly or indirectly, for every form of life on the surface of our planet. 'The sun's energy that bathes the Earth is harnessed by photosynthesis.Once transformed, it's passed on from one lifeform to another as food. The flow of energy animates all living things.The golden jellyfish has evolved to carry algae within their bodies and feed off the glucose the plants create.The jellyfish move towards the light of the Sun throughout the day to increase photosynthesis. The symbiotic relationship between the two species allows the jellyfish to live off the glucose the algae produce.to-topBack to topUses of glucoseGlucose is a useful molecule that is made during the process of photosynthesis. The initial use for glucose, when broken down during respiration, is to release energy. Glucose is a molecule that can be bonded together to make many types of carbohydrates including cellulose and starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals). Think of it like each glucose molecule being an individual bead on a necklace and the entire necklace represents the carbohydrate molecule.Plants only photosynthesise and synthesise glucose during the day when there is sunlight, but they use glucose for respiration all the time, including during the night.CelluloseGlucose is used to make cellulose. Cellulose is an example of a natural polymer. Cellulose is the main component found in plant cell walls and this gives the plant cell strength and support. Humans cannot digest cellulose, but it is important in your diet as fibre. Fibre assists your digestive system, keeping food moving through the gut and pushing waste out of the body.StarchOther uses of glucose produced from photosynthesis is to make the insoluble storage molecule starch. Most plants including rice, potatoes and wheat store their energy as starch. Starch is also a polymer and can be converted back to glucose by the plant when it is needed, for example at night for respiration.Fats and oilsGlucose can also be converted to fats and oils such as olive oil. Fats and oils are also used by the plant as a storage form of energy.Amino acidsGlucose produced in photosynthesis can be used to help make amino acids. These amino acids are used by the plant to synthesise proteins. Minerals such as nitrate ions are also absorbed by the roots of the plants to help make these amino acids. Foods such as peas are good protein sources.to-topBack to topTest your knowledgeto-topBack to topto-topBack to topBuild on your knowledge with these guides. Explore the BBCCopyright © 2023 BBC.

What is photosynthesis? By published 3 November 2022 Photosynthesis is the process plants, algae and some bacteria use to turn sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in the carbon dioxide produced by all breathing organisms and reintroduces oxygen into the atmosphere. (Image credit: KPG_Payless | Shutterstock) Jump to: Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae and some to turn sunlight into energy. The process chemically converts carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into food (sugars) and . The chemical reaction often relies on a pigment called chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color. Photosynthesis is also the reason our planet is blanketed in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.Types of photosynthetic processesThere are two types of photosynthesis: oxygenic and anoxygenic. They both follow very similar principles, but the former is the most common and is seen in plants, algae and cyanobacteria. During oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy transfers electrons from water (H2O) taken up by plant roots to CO2 to produce . In this transfer, the CO2 is ""reduced,"" or receives electrons, and the water is ""oxidized,"" or loses electrons. Oxygen is produced along with carbohydrates.This process creates a balance on Earth, in which the carbon dioxide produced by breathing organisms as they consume oxygen in respiration is converted back into oxygen by plants, algae and bacteria.Anoxygenic photosynthesis, meanwhile, uses electron donors that are not water and the process does not generate oxygen, according to ""Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria"" by . The process typically occurs in bacteria such as green bacteria and phototrophic purple bacteria. The Photosynthesis equationThough both types of photosynthesis are complex, multistep affairs, the overall process can be neatly summarized as a chemical equation.The oxygenic photosynthesis equation is: 6CO2 + 12H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2OHere, six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with 12 molecules of water (H2O) using light energy. The end result is the formation of a single carbohydrate molecule (C6H12O6, or glucose) along with six molecules each of oxygen and water.Similarly, the various anoxygenic photosynthesis reactions can be represented as a single generalized formula:CO2 + 2H2A + Light Energy → [CH2O] + 2A + H2OThe letter A in the equation is a variable, and H2A represents the potential electron donor. For example, ""A"" may represent sulfur in the electron donor hydrogen sulfide (H2S), according to medical and life sciences news site . How is carbon dioxide and oxygen exchanged? Plants absorb CO2 from the surrounding air and release water and oxygen via microscopic pores on their leaves called stomata. When stomata open, they let in CO2; however, while open, the stomata release oxygen and let water vapor escape. Stomata close to prevent water loss, but that means the plant can no longer gain CO2 for photosynthesis. This tradeoff between CO2 gain and water loss is a particular problem for plants growing in hot, dry environments. How do plants absorb sunlight for photosynthesis?Plants contain special pigments that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis.Chlorophyll is the primary pigment used for photosynthesis and gives plants their green color, according to science education site . Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light and reflects green light. Chlorophyll is a large molecule and takes a lot of resources to make; as such, it breaks down towards the end of the leaf's life, and most of the pigment's nitrogen (one of the building blocks of chlorophyll) is resorbed back into the plant, When leaves lose their chlorophyll in the fall, other leaf pigments such as and anthocyanins begin to show. While carotenoids primarily absorb blue light and reflect yellow, anthocyanins absorb blue-green light and reflect red light, according to Harvard University's .Pigment molecules are associated with proteins, which allow them the flexibility to move toward light and toward one another. A large collection of 100 to 5,000 pigment molecules constitutes an ""antenna,"" according to an article by , a professor at Arizona State University. These structures effectively capture light energy from the sun, in the form of photons.The situation is a little different for bacteria. While cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll, other bacteria, for example, purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, contain bacteriochlorophyll to absorb light for anoxygenic photosynthesis, according to """" (For Dummies, 2019). Related: Where in the plant does photosynthesis take place?Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, a type of plastid (an organelle with a membrane) that contains chlorophyll and is primarily found in plant leaves. Chloroplasts are similar to , the energy powerhouses of cells, in that they have their own genome, or collection of genes, contained within circular DNA. These genes that are essential to the organelle and to photosynthesis.Inside chloroplasts are plate-shaped structures called thylakoids that are responsible for harvesting photons of light for photosynthesis, according to the biology terminology website . The thylakoids are stacked on top of each other in columns known as grana. In between the grana is the stroma — a fluid containing enzymes, molecules and ions, where sugar formation takes place. Ultimately, light energy must be transferred to a pigment-protein complex that can convert it to chemical energy, in the form of electrons. In plants, light energy is transferred to chlorophyll pigments. The conversion to chemical energy is accomplished when a chlorophyll pigment expels an electron, which can then move on to an appropriate recipient. The pigments and proteins that convert light energy to chemical energy and begin the process of electron transfer are known as reaction centers.Light-dependent reactionsWhen a photon of light hits the reaction center, a pigment molecule such as chlorophyll releases an electron.The released electron escapes through a series of protein complexes linked together, known as an electron transport chain. As it moves through the chain, it generates the energy to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate, a source of chemical energy for cells) and NADPH — both of which are required in the next stage of photosynthesis in the Calvin cycle. The ""electron hole"" in the original chlorophyll pigment is filled by taking an electron from water. This splitting of water molecules releases oxygen into the atmosphere.Light-independent reactions: The Calvin cycle The Calvin cycle is the three-step process that generates sugars for the plant, and is named after , the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who discovered it decades ago. The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH produced in chlorophyll to generate carbohydrates. It takes plate in the plant stroma, the inner space in chloroplasts.In the first step of this cycle, called carbon fixation, an enzyme called RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase, also known as rubiso, helps incorporate CO2 into an organic molecule called 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA). In the process, it breaks off a phosphate group on six ATP molecules to convert them to ADP, releasing energy in the process, according to LibreTexts.In the second step, 3-PGA is reduced, meaning it takes electrons from six NADPH molecules and produces two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) molecules.One of these G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle to do other things in the plant. The remaining G3P molecules go into the third step, which is regenerating rubisco. In between these steps, the plant produces glucose, or sugar.Three CO2 molecules are needed to produce six G3P molecules, and it takes six turns around the Calvin cycle to make one molecule of carbohydrate, according to Khan Academy.Types of photosynthesis There are three main types of photosynthetic pathways: C3, C4 and CAM. They all produce sugars from CO2 using the Calvin cycle, but each pathway is slightly different.C3 photosynthesisMost plants use C3 photosynthesis, according to the photosynthesis research project . C3 plants include cereals (wheat and rice), cotton, potatoes and soybeans. This process is named for the three-carbon compound 3-PGA that it uses during the Calvin cycle. C4 photosynthesisPlants such as maize and sugarcane use C4 photosynthesis. This process uses a four-carbon compound intermediate (called oxaloacetate) which is , according to Biology Online. Malate is then transported into the bundle sheath where it breaks down and releases CO2, which is then fixed by rubisco and made into sugars in the Calvin cycle (just like C3 photosynthesis). C4 plants are better adapted to hot, dry environments and can continue to fix carbon even when their stomata are closed (as they have a clever storage solution), according to Biology Online. CAM photosynthesisCrassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is found in plants adapted to very hot and dry environments, such as cacti and pineapples, according to the Khan Academy. When stomata open to take in CO2, they risk losing water to the external environment. Because of this, plants in very arid and hot environments have adapted. One adaptation is CAM, whereby plants open stomata at night (when temperatures are lower and water loss is less of a risk). According to the Khan Academy, CO2 enters the plants via the stomata and is fixed into oxaloacetate and converted into malate or another organic acid (like in the C4 pathway). The CO2 is then available for light-dependent reactions in the daytime, and stomata close, reducing the risk of water loss.

It is the way in which virtually all energy in the biosphere becomes available to living things. As primary producers, photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth’s food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher life-forms. Additionally, almost all the in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth, most organisms would disappear, and Earth’s atmosphere would eventually become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen. What is the basic formula for photosynthesis?The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by (implied by the arrow) into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products.

Most living things depend on photosynthetic cells to manufacture the complex organic molecules they require as a source of energy. Photosynthetic cells are quite diverse and include cells found in green plants, phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria. During the process of photosynthesis, cells use carbon dioxide and energy from the Sun to make sugar molecules and oxygen. These sugar molecules are the basis for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as glucose. Then, via respiration processes, cells use oxygen and glucose to synthesize energy-rich carrier molecules, such as ATP, and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. Therefore, the synthesis of glucose and its breakdown by cells are opposing processes. The building and breaking of carbon-based material — from carbon dioxide to complex organic molecules (photosynthesis) then back to carbon dioxide (respiration) — is part of what is commonly called the global carbon cycle. Indeed, the fossil fuels we use to power our world today are the ancient remains of once-living organisms, and they provide a dramatic example of this cycle at work. The carbon cycle would not be possible without photosynthesis, because this process accounts for the ""building"" portion of the cycle (Figure 2). However, photosynthesis doesn't just drive the carbon cycle — it also creates the oxygen necessary for respiring organisms. Interestingly, although green plants contribute much of the oxygen in the air we breathe, phytoplankton and cyanobacteria in the world's oceans are thought to produce between one-third and one-half of atmospheric oxygen on Earth. What Cells and Organelles Are Involved in Photosynthesis? Figure 3: Structure of a chloroplast© 2010 All rights reserved. Photosynthetic cells contain special pigments that absorb light energy. Different pigments respond to different wavelengths of visible light. Chlorophyll, the primary pigment used in photosynthesis, reflects green light and absorbs red and blue light most strongly. In plants, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which contain the chlorophyll. Chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane and contain a third inner membrane, called the thylakoid membrane, that forms long folds within the organelle. In electron micrographs, thylakoid membranes look like stacks of coins, although the compartments they form are connected like a maze of chambers. The green pigment chlorophyll is located within the thylakoid membrane, and the space between the thylakoid and the chloroplast membranes is called the stroma (Figure 3, Figure 4). Chlorophyll A is the major pigment used in photosynthesis, but there are several types of chlorophyll and numerous other pigments that respond to light, including red, brown, and blue pigments. These other pigments may help channel light energy to chlorophyll A or protect the cell from photo-damage. For example, the photosynthetic protists called dinoflagellates, which are responsible for the ""red tides"" that often prompt warnings against eating shellfish, contain a variety of light-sensitive pigments, including both chlorophyll and the red pigments responsible for their dramatic coloration. Figure 4: Diagram of a chloroplast inside a cell, showing thylakoid stacksShown here is a chloroplast inside a cell, with the outer membrane (OE) and inner membrane (IE) labeled. Other features of the cell include the nucleus (N), mitochondrion (M), and plasma membrane (PM). At right and below are microscopic images of thylakoid stacks called grana. Note the relationship between the granal and stromal membranes.© 2004 Nature Publishing Group Soll, J. & Schleiff, E. Protein import into chloroplasts. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 5, 198-208 (2004) doi:10.1038/nrm1333. All rights reserved. What Are the Steps of Photosynthesis? Photosynthesis consists of both light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. In plants, the so-called ""light"" reactions occur within the chloroplast thylakoids, where the aforementioned chlorophyll pigments reside. When light energy reaches the pigment molecules, it energizes the electrons within them, and these electrons are shunted to an electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane. Every step in the electron transport chain then brings each electron to a lower energy state and harnesses its energy by producing ATP and NADPH. Meanwhile, each chlorophyll molecule replaces its lost electron with an electron from water; this process essentially splits water molecules to produce oxygen (Figure 5). Figure 5: The light and dark reactions in the chloroplastThe chloroplast is involved in both stages of photosynthesis. The light reactions take place in the thylakoid. There, water (H2O) is oxidized, and oxygen (O2) is released. The electrons that freed from the water are transferred to ATP and NADPH. The dark reactions then occur outside the thylakoid. In these reactions, the energy from ATP and NADPH is used to fix carbon dioxide (CO2). The products of this reaction are sugar molecules and various other organic molecules necessary for cell function and metabolism. Note that the dark reaction takes place in the stroma (the aqueous fluid surrounding the stacks of thylakoids) and in the cytoplasm.© 2010 All rights reserved. Once the light reactions have occurred, the light-independent or ""dark"" reactions take place in the chloroplast stroma. During this process, also known as carbon fixation, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules generated by the light reactions drives a chemical pathway that uses the carbon in carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) to build a three-carbon sugar called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Cells then use G3P to build a wide variety of other sugars (such as glucose) and organic molecules. Many of these interconversions occur outside the chloroplast, following the transport of G3P from the stroma. The products of these reactions are then transported to other parts of the cell, including the mitochondria, where they are broken down to make more energy carrier molecules to satisfy the metabolic demands of the cell. In plants, some sugar molecules are stored as sucrose or starch. Conclusion Photosynthetic cells contain chlorophyll and other light-sensitive pigments that capture solar energy. In the presence of carbon dioxide, such cells are able to convert this solar energy into energy-rich organic molecules, such as glucose. These cells not only drive the global carbon cycle, but they also produce much of the oxygen present in atmosphere of the Earth. Essentially, nonphotosynthetic cells use the products of photosynthesis to do the opposite of photosynthesis: break down glucose and release carbon dioxide. eBooks This page appears in the following eBook Topic rooms within Cell Biology No topic rooms are there.

The chemical energy is stored in the form of sugars, which are created from water and carbon dioxide. 3,12,343 Table of Contents Photosynthesis definition states that the process exclusively takes place in the chloroplasts through photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotene and xanthophyll. All green plants and a few other autotrophic organisms utilize photosynthesis to synthesize nutrients by using carbon dioxide, water and sunlight. The by-product of the photosynthesis process is oxygen.Let us have a detailed look at the process, reaction and importance of photosynthesis. What Is Photosynthesis in Biology? The word “photosynthesis” is derived from the Greek words phōs (pronounced: “fos”) and σύνθεσις (pronounced: “synthesis“)Phōs means “light” and σύνθεσις means, “combining together.” This means “combining together with the help of light.” Photosynthesis also applies to other organisms besides green plants. These include several prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria, purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria. These organisms exhibit photosynthesis just like green plants.The glucose produced during photosynthesis is then used to fuel various cellular activities. The by-product of this physio-chemical process is oxygen. A visual representation of the photosynthesis reaction Photosynthesis is also used by algae to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Oxygen is liberated as a by-product and light is considered as a major factor to complete the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs when plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Leaves contain microscopic cellular organelles known as chloroplasts. Each chloroplast contains a green-coloured pigment called chlorophyll. Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules whereas carbon dioxide and oxygen enter through the tiny pores of stomata located in the epidermis of leaves. Another by-product of photosynthesis is sugars such as glucose and fructose. These sugars are then sent to the roots, stems, leaves, fruits, flowers and seeds. In other words, these sugars are used by the plants as an energy source, which helps them to grow. These sugar molecules then combine with each other to form more complex carbohydrates like cellulose and starch. The cellulose is considered as the structural material that is used in plant cell walls. Also Read: Where Does This Process Occur? Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants and blue-green algae. All green parts of a plant, including the green stems, green leaves, and sepals – floral parts comprise of chloroplasts – green colour plastids. These cell organelles are present only in plant cells and are located within the mesophyll cells of leaves. Factors Affecting Photosynthesis Photosynthesis process requires several factors such as: Light Intensity: Increased light intensity results in a higher rate of photosynthesis. On the other hand, low light intensity results in a lower rate of photosynthesis. The concentration of CO2: Higher concentration of carbon dioxide helps in increasing the rate of photosynthesis. Usually, carbon dioxide in the range of 300 – 400 PPM is adequate for photosynthesis. Temperature: For efficient execution of photosynthesis, it is important to have a temperature range between 25° to 35° C. Water: As water is an important factor in photosynthesis, its deficiency can lead to problems in the intake of carbon dioxide. The scarcity of water leads to the refusal of stomatal opening to retain the amount of water they have stored inside. Pollution: Industrial pollutants and other particulates may settle on the leaf surface. This can block the pores of stomata which makes it difficult to take in carbon dioxide. Also Read: Photosynthesis Equation Photosynthesis reaction involves two reactants, carbon dioxide and water. These two reactants yield two products, namely, oxygen and glucose. Hence, the photosynthesis reaction is considered to be an endothermic reaction. Following is the photosynthesis formula: 6CO2 + 6H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6O2 Unlike plants, certain bacteria that perform photosynthesis do not produce oxygen as the by-product of photosynthesis. Such bacteria are called anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. The bacteria that do produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis are called oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Photosynthetic Pigments There are four different types of pigments present in leaves: Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll b Xanthophylls Carotenoids Structure Of Chlorophyll The structure of Chlorophyll consists of 4 nitrogen atoms that surround a magnesium atom. A hydrocarbon tail is also present. Pictured above is chlorophyll-f, which is more effective in near-infrared light than chlorophyll-a Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of the and in the mesosomes of cyanobacteria. This green colour pigment plays a vital role in the process of photosynthesis by permitting plants to absorb energy from sunlight. Chlorophyll is a mixture of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b.Besides green plants, other organisms that perform photosynthesis contain various other forms of chlorophyll such as chlorophyll-c1, chlorophyll-c2, chlorophyll-d and chlorophyll-f. Also Read: Process Of Photosynthesis At the cellular level, the photosynthesis process takes place in cell organelles called chloroplasts. These organelles contain a green-coloured pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for the characteristic green colouration of the leaves. As already stated, photosynthesis occurs in the leaves and the specialized cell organelles responsible for this process is called the chloroplast. Structurally, a leaf comprises a petiole, epidermis and a lamina. The lamina is used for absorption of sunlight and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Structure of Chloroplast. Note the presence of the thylakoid “Photosynthesis Steps:” During the process of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide enters through the stomata, water is absorbed by the root hairs from the soil and is carried to the leaves through the xylem vessels. Chlorophyll absorbs the light energy from the sun to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen from water molecules and carbon dioxide absorbed from the air are used in the production of glucose. Furthermore, oxygen is liberated out into the atmosphere through the leaves as a waste product. Glucose is a source of food for plants that provide energy for , while the rest is stored in the roots, leaves and fruits, for their later use. Pigments are other fundamental cellular components of photosynthesis. They are the molecules that impart colour and they absorb light at some specific wavelength and reflect back the unabsorbed light. All green plants mainly contain chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids which are present in the thylakoids of chloroplasts. It is primarily used to capture light energy. Chlorophyll-a is the main pigment. The process of photosynthesis occurs in two stages: Light-dependent reaction or light reaction Light independent reaction or dark reaction Stages of Photosynthesis in Plants depicting the two phases – Light reaction and Dark reaction Light Reaction of Photosynthesis (or) Light-dependent Reaction Photosynthesis begins with the light reaction which is carried out only during the day in the presence of sunlight. In plants, the light-dependent reaction takes place in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The Grana, membrane-bound sacs like structures present inside the thylakoid functions by gathering light and is called photosystems. These photosystems have large complexes of pigment and proteins molecules present within the plant cells, which play the primary role during the process of light reactions of photosynthesis. There are two types of photosystems: photosystem I and photosystem II. Under the light-dependent reactions, the light energy is converted to ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second phase of photosynthesis. During the light reactions, ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron-transport chains, water is used and oxygen is produced. The chemical equation in the light reaction of photosynthesis can be reduced to: 2H2O + 2NADP+ + 3ADP + 3Pi → O2 + 2NADPH + 3ATP Dark Reaction of Photosynthesis (or) Light-independent Reaction Dark reaction is also called carbon-fixing reaction. It is a light-independent process in which sugar molecules are formed from the water and carbon dioxide molecules. The dark reaction occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast where they utilize the NADPH and ATP products of the light reaction. Plants capture the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through stomata and proceed to the Calvin photosynthesis cycle. In the , the ATP and NADPH formed during light reaction drive the reaction and convert 6 molecules of carbon dioxide into one sugar molecule or glucose. The chemical equation for the dark reaction can be reduced to: 3CO2 + 6 NADPH + 5H2O + 9ATP → G3P + 2H+ + 6 NADP+ + 9 ADP + 8 Pi * G3P – glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Calvin photosynthesis Cycle (Dark Reaction) Also Read: Importance of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is essential for the existence of all life on earth. It serves a crucial role in the food chain – the plants create their food using this process, thereby, forming the primary producers. Photosynthesis is also responsible for the production of oxygen – which is needed by most organisms for their survival. Frequently Asked QuestionsQ1 1. What is Photosynthesis?

Herbivores then obtain this energy by eating plants, and carnivores obtain it by eating herbivores.The processDuring photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores energy within the glucose molecules.ChlorophyllInside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant its green color. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy from blue- and red-light waves, and reflects green-light waves, making the plant appear green.Light-dependent reactions vs. light-independent reactionsWhile there are many steps behind the process of photosynthesis, it can be broken down into two major stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reaction takes place within the thylakoid membrane and requires a steady stream of sunlight, hence the name light-dependent reaction. The chlorophyll absorbs energy from the light waves, which is converted into chemical energy in the form of the molecules ATP and NADPH. The light-independent stage, also known as the Calvin Cycle, takes place in the stroma, the space between the thylakoid membranes and the chloroplast membranes, and does not require light, hence the name light-independent reaction. During this stage, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules is used to assemble carbohydrate molecules, like glucose, from carbon dioxide.C3 and C4 photosynthesisNot all forms of photosynthesis are created equal, however. There are different types of photosynthesis, including C3 photosynthesis and C4 photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is used by the majority of plants. It involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become glucose. C4 photosynthesis, on the other hand, produces a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle. A benefit of C4 photosynthesis is that by producing higher levels of carbon, it allows plants to thrive in environments without much light or water.ATPnoun(adenosine triphosphate) chemical found in most living cells and used for energy.C3 photosynthesisnounUsed by the majority of plants, it involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become a sugar called glucose.C4 photosynthesisnounInvolves producing a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle in plants that do not get a lot of light or water.Calvin cyclenounseries of reactions that take place during photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water from the atmosphere are converted into sugar.carbonnounchemical element with the symbol C, which forms the basis of all known life.carnivorenounorganism that eats meat.chlorophyllnounplants' green pigment that is essential to photosynthesis.chloroplastnounpart of the cell in plants and other autotrophs that carries out the process of photosynthesis.glucosenoun""simple sugar"" chemical produced by many plants during photosynthesis.herbivorenounorganism that eats mainly plants and other producers.NADPHnoun(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) chemical found in most living cells and used for energy.organellenounspecialized part of a cell that performs a specific function.oxygennounchemical element with the symbol O, whose gas form is 21% of the Earth's atmosphere.photosynthesisnounprocess by which plants turn water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide into water, oxygen, and simple sugars.stromanounIn a plant cell, the protein-containing matrix between the thylakoid membranes and the chloroplast membrane.thylakoid membranenounPart of the chloroplast where light-dependent reactions take place.CreditsMedia CreditsThe audio, illustrations, photos, and videos are credited beneath the media asset, except for promotional images, which generally link to another page that contains the media credit.

Frankly, if this process didn't occur, we probably wouldn't have life on Earth, and I wouldn't be making this video for you, because there'd be no place for me to actually get food. And the process is called photosynthesis. And you're probably reasonably familiar with the idea. The whole idea is plants, and actually bacteria and algae and other things, but we normally associate it with plants. Let me make it in very simple terms. So we normally associate it with plants. And it's a process that plants use, and we might have learned this when we were very young. It's the process that plants use to take carbon dioxide plus some water plus some sunlight and turn it into some sugars or some maybe carbohydrates. Carbohydrates or sugars plus oxygen. Obviously, this has two very profound pieces to it for us as a living species. One, we need carbohydrates or we need sugars in order to fuel our bodies. You saw that in the cellular respiration videos. We generate all of our ATP by performing cellular respiration on glucose, which is essentially a byproduct, or a broken down carbohydrate. It's the simplest one for us to process in cellular respiration. And the second hugely important part is getting the oxygen. Once again, we need to breathe oxygen in order for us to break down glucose, in order to respire, in order to perform cellar respiration. So these two things are key for life, especially for life that breathes oxygen. So this process, other than the fact that it's interesting, that there are organisms around us, mostly plants, that are able to harness actual sunlight. You have these fusion reactions in the sun 93 million miles away, and it's releasing these photons, and some small subset of those photons reach the surface of Earth. They make their way through clouds and whatever else. And then these plants and bacteria and algae are able to harness that somehow and turn them into sugars that we can then eat or maybe the cow eats them and we eat the cow if we're not vegetarians, and we can then use that for energy. Not that the cow is all carbohydrates, but this is essentially what is used as the fuel or the energy for all of the other important compounds that we eat. This is where we get all of our fuel. So this is fuel for animals. Or you know, if you eat a potato directly, you are directly getting your carbohydrates. But anyway, this is a very simple notion of photosynthesis, but it's not incorrect. I mean, if you had to know one thing about photosynthesis, this would be it. But let's delve a little bit deeper and try to get into the guts of it and see if we can understand a little bit better how this actually happens. I find it amazing that somehow photons of sunlight are used to create these sugar molecules or these carbohydrates. So let's delve a little bit deeper. So we can write the general equation for photosynthesis. Well, I've almost written it here. But I'll write it a little bit more scientifically specific. You start off with some carbon dioxide. You add to that some water, and you add to that-- instead of sunlight, I'm going to say photons because these are what really do excite the electrons in the chlorophyll that go down, and you'll see this process probably in this video, and we'll go in more detail in the next few videos. But that excited electron goes to a high energy state, and as it goes to a lower energy state, we're able to harness that energy to produce ATPs, and you'll see NADPHs, and those are used to produce carbohydrates. But we'll see that in a little bit. But the overview of photosynthesis, you start off with these constituents, And then you end up with a carbohydrate. And a carbohydrate could be glucose, doesn't have to be glucose. So the general way we can write a carbohydrates is CH2O. And we'll put an n over here, that we could have n multiples of these, and normally, n will be at least three. In the case of glucose, n is 6. You have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens and 6 oxygens. So this is a general term for carbohydrates, but you could have many multiples of that. You could have these long-chained carbohydrates, so you end up with a carbohydrate and then you end up with some oxygen. So this right here isn't so different than what I wrote up here in my first overview of how we always imagined photosynthesis in our heads. In order to make this equation balance-- let's see, I have n carbons so I need n carbons there. Let's see, I have two n hydrogens here. Two hydrogens and I have n there, so I need two n hydrogens here. So I'll put an n out there. And lets see how many oxygens. I have two n oxygens, plus another n, so I have three n oxygens. So let's see, I have one n, and you put an n here, and then I have two n, and I think this equation balances out. So this is a 30,000-foot view of what's going on in photosynthesis. But when you dig a little deeper, you'll see that this doesn't happen directly, that this happens through a bunch of steps that eventually gets us to the carbohydrate. So in general, we can break down photosynthesis. I'll rewrite the word. We can break down photosynthesis-- and we'll delve deeper into future videos, but I want to get you the overview first-- into two stages. We can call one the light reactions. Or sometimes they are called the light-dependent reactions, and that actually would probably be a better way to write it. Let me write it like that. Light dependent means that they need light to occur. Light-dependent reactions. And then you have something called the dark reactions, and that's actually a bad name, because it also occurs in the light. Dark reactions, I wrote in a slightly darker color. And the reason why I said it's a bad name is because it still occurs in the light. But the reason why they probably called it the dark reaction is that you don't need light, or that part of photosynthesis isn't dependent on photons to occur. So a better term for it would have been light-independent reaction. So just to be clear, the light reactions actually need sunlight. They actually need photons for them to proceed. The dark reactions do not need photons for them to happen, although they do occur when the sun is out. They don't need those photons, but they need the byproducts from the light reaction to occur, so that's why it's called the light-independent reaction. They occur while the sun is out, but they don't need the sun. This needs the sun, so let me make it very clear. So this requires sunlight. This requires photons. And let me just make a very brief overview of this. This'll maybe let us start building a scaffold from which we can dig deeper. So the light reactions need photons, and then it needs water. So water goes into the light reactions and out of the other side of the light reactions. We end up with some molecular oxygen. So that's what happens in the light reactions, and I'm going to go much deeper into what actually occurs. And what the light the actions produce is ATP, which we know is the cellular or the biological currency of energy. It produces ATP and it produces NADPH. Now, when we studied cellular respiration, we saw the molecule NADH. NADPH is very similar. You just have this P there. You just have this phosphate group there, but they really perform similar mechanisms. That this agent right here, this molecule right here, is able to give away-- now let's think about what this means-- it's able to give away this hydrogen and the electron associated with this hydrogen. So if you give away an electron to someone else or someone else gains an electron, that something else is being reduced. Let me write that down. This is a good reminder. OIL RIG. Oxidation is losing an electron. Reduction is gaining an electron. Your charge is reduced when you gain an electron. It has a negative charge. So this is a reducing agent. It gets oxidized by losing the hydrogen and the electron with it. I have a whole discussion on the biological versus chemistry view of oxidation, but it's the same idea. When I lose a hydrogen, I also lose the ability to hog that hydrogen's electron. So this right here, when it reacts with other things, it's a reducing agent. It gives away this hydrogen and the electron associated with it, and so the other thing gets reduced. So this thing is a reducing agent. And what's useful about it is when this hydrogen, and especially the electron associated with that hydrogen, goes from the NADPH to, say, another molecule and goes to a lower energy state, that energy can also be used in the dark reactions. And we saw in cellular respiration the very similar molecule, NADH, that through the Kreb Cycle, or actually more importantly, that through the electron transport chain, was able to help produce ATP as it gave away its electrons and they went to lower energy states. But I don't want to confuse you too much. So the light reactions, you take in photons, you take in water, it spits out oxygen, and it spits out ATP and NADPH that can then be used in the dark reactions. And the dark reactions, for most plants we talk about, it's called the Calvin Cycle. And I'll go into a lot more detail of what actually occurs in the Calvin Cycle, but it takes in the ATP, the NADPH, and it produces-- it doesn't directly produce glucose. It produces-- oh, you probably saw this. You could call it PGAL. You could call it G3P. These all stand for-- let me write these down-- this is phosphoglyceraldehyde. My handwriting broke down. Or you could call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Same exact molecule. You can almost imagine it as-- this is a very gross oversimplification-- as three carbons with a phosphate group attached to it. But this can then be used to produce other carbohydrates, including glucose. If you have two of these, you can use those two to produce glucose. So let's just take a quick overview again because this is super important. I'm going to make videos on the light reactions and the dark reactions. Those will be the next two videos I make. So photosynthesis, you start with photons. All of these occur when the sun is out, but only the light reactions actually need the photons. The light reactions take photons-- we're going to go into more detail about what actually occurs-- and it takes in water. Oxygen gets spit out. ATP and NADPH get spit out, which are then used by the dark reaction, or the Calvin Cycle, or the light-independent reaction, because these still occur in the light. They just don't need photons. So they're the light-independent reaction. And it uses that in conjunction-- and we'll talk about other molecules that are used in conjunction. Oh, and I forgot a very important constituent of the dark reaction. It needs carbon dioxide. That's where you get your carbons to keep producing these phosphoglyceraldehydes, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. So that's super important. It takes in the carbon dioxide, the products from the light reactions, and then uses that in the Calvin Cycle to produce this very simple building block of other carbohydrates. And if you remember from glycolysis, you might remember that this PGAL molecule, or this G3P-- same thing-- this was actually the first product when we split glucose in two when we performed the glycolysis. So now we're going the other way. We're building glucose so that we can split it later for energy. So this is an overview of photosynthesis, and in the next couple of videos, I'm actually going to delve a little bit deeper and tell you about the light reactions and the dark reactions and how they actually occur.Loading..."

In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. Photosynthesis is usually viewed as a two-step process. First, in the light reactions, the energy-providing molecule ATP is synthesized using light energy absorbed by chlorophyll and accessory pigments such as carotenoids and phycobilins, and water is broken apart into oxygen and a hydrogen ion, with the electron of the hydrogen transferred to another energy molecule, NADPH. The ATP and NADPH molecules power the second part of photosynthesis by the transfer of electrons. In these light-independent or dark reactions, carbon is broken away from carbon dioxide and combined with hydrogen via the Calvin cycle to create carbohydrates. Some of the carbohydrates, the sugars, can then be transported around the organism for immediate use; others, the starches, can be stored for later use. Compare chemosynthesis. See Note at transpiration.a closer lookAlmost all life on Earth depends on food made by organisms that can perform photosynthesis, such as green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. These organisms make carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water using light energy from the Sun. They capture this energy with various pigments which absorb different wavelengths of light. The most important pigment, chlorophyll a, captures mainly blue and red light frequencies, but reflects green light. In plants, the other pigments are chlorophyll b and carotenoids. The carotenoids are usually masked by the green color of chlorophyll, but in temperate environments they can be seen as the bright reds and yellows of autumn after the chlorophyll in the leaves has broken down. The energy gathered by these pigments is passed to chlorophyll a. During the light reactions, the plant uses this energy to break water molecules into oxygen (O2), hydrogen ions, and electrons. The light reactions produce more oxygen than is needed for cellular respiration, so it is released as waste. All of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere today was produced as waste by photosynthetic organisms, especially cyanobacteria, which have been producing oxygen for some three billion years, since their first appearance in the Precambrian Eon. During the dark reactions, the plant uses hydrogen ions and the electrons to make carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Within the leaf of a green plant, photosynthesis takes place in chlorophyll-containing chloroplasts in the columnlike cells of the palisade layer and in the cells of the spongy parenchyma. The cells obtain carbon dioxide from air that enters the leaf through holes called stomata, which also allow excess oxygen to escape. Water from the roots is brought to the leaf by the vascular tissues called xylem, while the carbohydrates made by the leaf are distributed to the rest of the plant by the vascular tissue called phloem.The American Heritage® Science Dictionary Copyright © 2011.

Among the endless diversity of living organisms in the world, are a unique breed. Unlike (, , , or ) that rely upon other living organisms for their nutritional requirements and nourishment, producers have been distinguished by their ability to synthesize their own food. This is the reason that we call producers “autotrophic or self-reliable” in nature while consumers of all the different categories are called “heterotrophic or dependent” in nature. Now among producers, there are different categories of producers, i.e. different mechanisms via which they produce their own food. Photo-auto-litho-trophs: Since these organisms tend to derive their nutrition by channeling the sun’s light energy, they are termed in nature. Also, since they utilize inorganic carbon and translate it into organic carbon atoms, i.e. their means of deriving food becomes autotrophic. Additionally, since the source of electrons (electron donors) here are inorganic compounds, they are specified as lithotrophic. In totality, they can be called photo-auto-litho-trophic in nature. Example: Green are nature’s brilliant entities that come under this category. They carry out a photosynthesis cycle by taking in and fixing it into (energy storage molecule). Some of them also give out gas that’s vital for the other life forms to survive in the earth’s atmosphere. Chemo-auto-lithotrophs: Many of us might be unaware of the fact that there are some autotrophs that don’t utilize sunlight. Rather they derive their energy stored from a different energy source like oxidation of inorganic compounds. The scope of today’s discussion is limited to photosynthesis and photoautotrophs. So, let’s get started and get to know the answers to these common questions: what is the photosynthesis process, what are the 3 stages of photosynthesis, what does photosynthesis produce, what is a byproduct of photosynthesis, what is the purpose of photosynthesis, is photosynthesis a chemical change, the various inputs and outputs of photosynthesis, which organisms perform photosynthesis, and many other more questions!!! Figure 1: From this flowchart, we can pin pointedly tell that plants are “photo-auto-litho-trophs”. Image Source: of Biology Online. What is Photosynthesis? Photosynthesis definition: Photosynthesis is a physio-chemical process carried out by photo-auto-lithotrophs. In simpler language, photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into ‘chemical energy’. This energy transformation is only possible due to the presence of the miraculous pigment molecule in photosynthesis. The chemical energy as referred to before is the fixed carbon molecules generated during photosynthesis. Green plants and algae have the ability to utilize carbon dioxide molecules and water and produce food (carbohydrates) for all life forms on Earth. There’s no doubt in the fact that life is impossible and unimaginable without green plants that photosynthesize and sustain the cycles of life. Let’s give you a brief outline of the topic before we head forward. Etymology: The photosynthesis process finds its origin in 2 Greek words, firsts one being “phōs (φῶς)” meaning ‘light’ and the second one being “sunthesis (σύνθεσις)” meaning ‘putting together’. The process of photosynthesis aids the conversion of light energy to chemical energy in varied forms of carbohydrate molecules like sugar molecules and starches. Organisms that perform photosynthesis: The organisms are called photo-auto-litho-trophs or simply photoautotrophs. Atmospheric gas consumed: Photosynthesizing organisms utilize carbon dioxide in photosynthesis (CO2). Atmospheric gas released by “some” photosynthetic organisms (MIND IT-Not all): Some photosynthesizing organisms convert carbon dioxide and aid the process of producing oxygen gas (O2). Examples of photosynthesizing organisms: Green plants, (earlier termed as blue-green algae), and different types of that essentially carry out phytoplankton photosynthesis. Why is photosynthesis important? The important function of photosynthesis: Food supply for the organisms on Earth, Oxygen supply for the survival of all organisms. Site of photosynthesis: Leaves and green tissues. (So when asked where photosynthesis takes place, we can tell that it is this site.) What are the reactants of photosynthesis: Carbon dioxide molecules + Water molecules + Light energy Products of photosynthesis: Fixed carbon (carbohydrates) + Oxygen (some cases) + Water Figure 2: Photosynthesis diagram. Image Credit: . Watch this vid about photosynthesis: Biology Definition: Photosynthesis is the of complex material using , , , and light energy (from sunlight) captured by light-absorbing , such as and other accessory . Photosynthesis may basically be simplified via this equation: 6CO2+12H2O+energy=C6H12O6+6O2+6H2O, wherein (CO2), (H2O), and light energy are utilized to synthesize an energy-rich carbohydrate like (C6H12O6). Other products are water and . Photosynthesis occurs in (e.g. ), which are membrane-bounded organelles containing photosynthetic (e.g. ), within the of and . In photosynthetic () that do not have membrane-bounded organelles, photosynthesis occurs in the thylakoid membranes in the . Etymology: from the Greek photo-, “light”, and synthesis, “putting together” Related forms: photosynthetic (adjective) Compare: See also: Types of Photosynthesis Plant photosynthesis and photosynthetic organisms can be classified under different categories on the basis of some characteristic features. They are: Types of organisms that carry out photosynthesis on the basis of “cellular structure” Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms carry out photosynthesis. Types of organisms that carry out photosynthesis on the basis of whether they release oxygen or not, i.e., photosynthesis 1 and 2: Oxygenic photosynthesis (release oxygen while photosynthesizing) Photosynthetic prokaryotes: for example, cyanobacteria Eukaryotic: for example, (, , Euglena) and green plants. In particular, algae photosynthesis can be observed in , , , & land plants, like , pteridophytes, , and .

Photosynthesis: a two-stage process Photosynthesis is an example of a metabolic process with 2 stages. Both the stages need light (direct or indirect sunlight). Hence, the long-claimed notion of the 2 processes being ‘absolute LIGHT and DARK reactions’ isn’t apt. Scientific studies have pointed out that even the 2nd stage of photosynthesis requires indirect sunlight. Therefore, rather than classifying the stages as light and dark photosynthesis reactions, we’ll like to classify the 2 stages as follows: Photochemical Reaction Process: Light energy is converted to ; photophosphorylation process (light-dependent reactions) Carbon fixation process: Inorganic carbon is converted to organic carbon (light-independent reactions). This is an endergonic process. This process can happen in 2 ways: Through Calvin cycle: In oxygenic photosynthesis as well as anoxygenic photosynthesis Through Non-Calvin cycle: Only is some anoxygenic photosynthesis Evolution of Photosynthesis Process It is postulated that the very first photosynthetic beings and photosynthesis evolved quite early down the evolutionary timescale of life. It is also believed that the first photosynthetic beings would have initially resorted to other available reducing agents like hydrogen ions or hydrogen sulfide in contrast to the modern-day photosynthetic organisms that utilize water as the “prime and only sources of electrons”. It is believed that cyanobacteria would have appeared on the surface of Earth much later than the first photosynthetic beings. Once appeared they must have saturated the Earth’s atmosphere with oxygen gas and led to its oxygenation. Only after the Earth was oxygenated, the more complex forms of life would have later evolved. Figure 7: Evolution of photosynthesis. Image Credit: . Overview When we compare photosynthesis to other metabolic processes like respiration, we can clearly notice that these two processes are almost opposite to each other. But another point to note is that both the processes in synchrony sustain life on Earth. You cannot separate respiration from photosynthesis or photosynthesis from respiration and expect life to run normally. It is not possible that way. Let’s try to compare and list some characteristic features of photosynthesis and processes. Photosynthesis vs. Respiration Anabolic vs Catabolic: Photosynthesis: process Cellular respiration: process By anabolic, we mean the photosynthesis process “utilizes energy to build biomolecules” like carbohydrates, starch, and sugars. These are further utilized by both the plants and the organisms dependent on plants for their nutritional needs. On the other hand, respiration is a catabolic process. This energy is utilized to break down complex molecules to derive nutrition out of them. Site of occurrence: Photosynthesis: In the of the eukaryotic phototrophic cells. Respiration: Primarily in the of the cell. Reactants: Photosynthesis: Carbon dioxide molecules + Water molecules + Light energy Respiration: Glucose + Oxygen Products: Photosynthesis: Fixed carbon (carbohydrates) + Oxygen (some cases) + Water Respiration: Carbon dioxide + Water +energy (ATP) Endergonic vs Exergonic/Endothermic vs Exothermic: Photosynthesis: Endergonic and endothermic Respiration: Exergonic and exothermic Just note that these terms endergonic and both convey the same meaning of “absorbing heat”. And the terms exergonic and exothermic also convey the same meaning of “releasing heat”. The only difference is that –gonics relates to “the relative change in the free energy of the system” while –thermic relates to “the relative change in enthalpy of the system”. Chemical reactions: Photosynthesis: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2 Respiration: C6H12O66 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O Photosynthetic Membranes and Organelles When we begin the discussion on this topic, it’s important that we know that no photosynthesis is possible without the pigment molecules that absorb light. The absorption of sunlight is the most vital step of photosynthesis. We should also note that the of is different for every light of different wavelengths. And the energy needed for the photosynthesis to be conducted is of “a very specific wavelength range”. For the absorption of lights of desired wavelengths, phototrophs organize their pigment molecules in the form of reaction center proteins. These proteins are located in the membranes of the organisms. Let’s learn how these pigment molecules reside inside the organism and how they make the membranes photosynthetic in nature. Prokaryotic photosynthetic organisms: These organisms have their pigment systems or photosystems located in the or the thylakoid membranes in the itself. There are no special organelles called chloroplasts in the prokaryotes. Figure 8: The pigment molecules of the prokaryotes are located in the cell membranes themselves and not in specialized chloroplasts. Image Credit: . Eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms (like green plants): These organisms have their pigment systems or located in the thylakoids of the chloroplast membranes. Eukaryotes have specialized organelles called chloroplasts (chlorophyll-containing plastids) in their cells. Figure 9: The pigment molecules of the eukaryotes are located in the thylakoid membranes of the specialized organelle “chloroplasts”. Image Credit: . Photosynthetic Pigments There are 2 types of photosynthetic pigments in the oxygenic photosynthesizing organisms. They are as follows: Porphyrin-derivatives (Chlorophyll in plants and Phycobilin) Carotenoids Figure 10: There is a range of photosynthetic pigments that collectively carry out photosynthesis. Image Credit: . Chlorophyll is the green-colored pigment essential for photosynthesis. Let’s try to list its major characteristic features and roles of it. Nature: Lipid Location: Embedded in the thylakoid membrane Types: 9 types as identified by Arnoff and Allen in 1966 (chlorophyll-a, b, c, d, e, bacteriochlorophyll a, b, chlorobium chlorophyll-650,666). Bacteriochlorophylls are present in the anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms. Primary photosynthetic pigment: Presence: In all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms Absorption range: Visible (blue and red) and IR (Infra-red) Ion important for its biological functioning: Magnesium ion (Mg2+) Structure: Chlorophyll-a, b, and d are “chlorin” derivatives; c is a “porphyrin” derivative. Chlorophyll Tail: Oxygenic photosynthetic organisms have a “phytol” tail in their chlorophyll; anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms have a “geranyl” tail in their bacteriochlorophylls. Role: Main pigment for capturing and storing solar energy Photochemical reaction (chlorophyll-a is present in the photochemical reaction center i.e. PCRC. Chlorophyll a, b, c, and d play a role in resonance energy transfer.) Carotenoids is the photosynthetic pigment essential for working in conjunction with chlorophyll. Let’s try to list its major characteristic features and roles of it. Nature: Lipid-soluble Types: More than 150 Presence: In all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms Absorption range: 400-500nm Forms: (simple hydrocarbon, for example, beta carotene) and (oxygenated hydrocarbon, for example, lutein) Roles: In excitation and resonance energy transfer Photo-protection (work as a free-radical scavenger as well as a quencher) Phycobilins aren’t present in all the oxygenic photosynthetic organisms. They have a tetrapyrrole structure (no need for magnesium ion). Types: Phycoerythrobilin, Phycocyanobilins, Allophycocyanobilins When these pigment molecules combine with a water-soluble protein, they form the pigment-protein complex (phycobiliproteins, like phycoerythrin and phycocyanin). Location: Since these phycobiliproteins are water-soluble, they can’t exist in the membranes like chlorophyll and carotenoids. Therefore, phycobilin pigments as their pigment-protein complex aggregate into clusters and adhere to the membrane. These clusters are called phycobilisomes. Exceptional Note: These are the only pigments that are associated with protein molecules. Role: Resonance energy transfer Organelle for Photosynthesis What is chloroplast? In eukaryotes, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts as they are the designated organelles for the photosynthesis process. There are nearly 10-100 chloroplasts in a typical . Inside chloroplasts are the thylakoids; the very specific site for the light capturing. The structure of this very unique part of the chloroplasts is briefly discussed here. Thylakoid is a membrane-bound compartment in the chloroplasts of eukaryotic organisms. They are also present as such in the cytosol of cyanobacteria (cyanobacteria don’t have chloroplasts but they have simply thylakoids). These thylakoids are the “primary site of the 1st stage of photosynthesis. i.e. “photochemical reaction” or popularly called “light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis”. The main components of the thylakoid are membrane, lumen, and lamellae. The chlorophyll molecules are present inside these thylakoid membranes. Figure 11: Chloroplast with labeled parts. Credit: Vossman, CC BY-SA. For a detailed description of the different parts of the chloroplast, read this: Light-dependent Reactions The first stage of photosynthesis is popularly called “light-dependent reactions”. We choose to call this stage the “1st stage: PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTION STAGE”. It is also called the “thylakoid reaction stage” or “hill’s reaction”. This stage is marked by 3 essential steps of photosynthesis: Oxidation of water, reduction of NADP+, and ATP formation. The site where these reactions occur is the lamellar part of the chloroplast. The units of light-dependent reactions are quantosomes. Figure 12: Light-dependent or the photochemical reaction stage of photosynthesis. Image Credit: , Let’s discuss this stage under some subheadings: Wavelengths of light involved and their absorption The white light that reaches Earth has subparts of different wavelengths together constituting the visible spectrum (390-760nm). But the photosynthetic organisms specifically use a subpart called PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation). PAR ranges from 400-760nm. Blue light is 470-500nm while red light is 660-760nm). The green light (500-580nm) is reflected back by the plants and this is the reason that plants appear green in color. Blue-green light is not used, only blue light is used. Figure 13: PAR or the Photosynthetically Active Radiation ranges from 400nm to 700nm. Image Credit: . Absorption spectrum and action spectrum Absorption Spectrum: This is a pigment-specific entity or terminology. To find the absorption spectrum of a pigment, you need to plot “the amount of absorption of different wavelengths of light by that particular pigment”. The graph has the “wavelengths of light (in nanometers/nm)” on the X-axis and the “percentage of light absorption” on the Y-axis. Figure 14: Different pigments absorb optimally different wavelengths of light. So the absorption spectrum of each pigment is characteristic of each one of them. Image Credit: . Action Spectrum: To find the action spectrum of a pigment, you need to plot the “effectiveness of the different wavelengths of light in stimulating photosynthesis process”. The graph has the “wavelengths of light (in nanometers/nm)” on the X-axis and the “rate of photosynthesis (measured as oxygen released)” on the Y-axis. When you superimpose the action spectrum of photosynthesis with the absorption spectrum of the specific pigment, you can find the contribution of each different wavelength in the photosynthesis rate, photosynthetic efficiency, and photosynthetic productivity. IMPORTANT NOTE: The absorption spectrum is calculated for any of the many pigments involved in photosynthesis. Contrastingly, the action spectrum is calculated only for the photochemical reaction performing pigment i.e. chlorophyll-a present at the reaction center. We identify the progress of photochemical reactions as the “evolution of oxygen gas” that primarily happens at the reaction center where only chlorophyll-a is present. Since the action is directly correlated to the specific excitation of chlorophyll-a molecule, the action spectrum is scientifically calculated only for this chlorophyll-a. Examples: Absorption spectrum of chlorophyll-a: 430 nm (blue), 660nm (red) {more absorbance at 660 nm) Absorption spectrum of chlorophyll-b: 430 nm (blue), 660nm (red) {more absorbance at 430 nm) Figure 15: Absorption spectrum shows the involved pigment in photosynthesis. As chlorophyll-a absorbs in this same exact range, the action spectrum is reflective of chlorophyll-a being the primary pigment. Image Credit: . What actually happens in the Light-dependent reaction Let’s briefly describe what actually happens here. 1 photon is absorbed by 1 molecule of the chlorophyll (P680) and simultaneously 1 electron is lost here. The electron flow of the photochemical reaction begins here. The electron is transferred to D1/D2 protein, then to a modified form of chlorophyll and “pheophytin”. After that, it’s transferred to plastoquinone A and then B. Roles of this electron flow: Initiates an electron flow down an electron transport chain. Ultimately aids the NADP reduction to NADPH. Creation of a proton gradient across the chloroplast membrane. Further on this proton gradient is exploited by the ATP synthase for the generation of ATP molecules. Figure 16: Activities at the PS-II. Image Credit: . Water photolysis Now, if you are wondering how the first electron lost by the 1st chlorophyll is replenished to keep this cycle going, read on. The answer to this query is “photolysis of water molecules”. The chlorophyll molecule regains the lost electron when the “oxygen-evolving complex” in the thylakoid membrane carries out the photolysis of water. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen. Many scientists had a doubt about the source of oxygen in photosynthesis. Some speculated the oxygen atom of the CO2 gas is the source of oxygen post-photosynthesis. But it was the collective contribution of some 4 scientists that gave clarity on this topic. C.B. Van Niel worked on purple photosynthetic bacteria (Chromatium vinosum) and found out that the source of oxygen is the oxidation of water molecules (‘indirect evidence’). While Ruben, Hassid, and Kamen carried out an isotopic study that gave ‘direct evidence’ of oxygen-evolving from H2O molecules and not CO2 molecules. Hydrolysis of 2 molecules of water leads to the evolution of 1 molecule of oxygen gas. The photosynthesis equation for light-dependent reactions (non-cyclic electron flow) or the chemical formula for photosynthesis: 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Z scheme The photochemical reaction (or the light-dependent reactions) can be classified as: Cyclic reaction: Only 1 photosystem () is involved. (Photon excites P700 in PS1, electron reaches Fe-S, then Ferredoxin, then Plastoquinone and then Cyt b6f complex and then Plastocyanin). Since in the solo involvement of PS1 here, the electron flow becomes cyclic. And this phosphorylation process is called cyclic phosphorylation. It happens in the stroma lamellae when light beyond 680nm is available. Non-cyclic reaction: Both photosystems (PS1 and ) are involved. (Photon excites P680 in PS2, the electron is lost and transferred to pheophytin, then sent on a roller coaster (Z-scheme). Within the z-scheme, the final redox reaction enables the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. And the chemiosmotic potential generation via proton pumping proton across the membrane and into the thylakoid lumen ensures ATP synthesis.

Light-Independent Reactions (Carbon-fixation Reaction) Also called the carbon fixation process, the “light-independent reactions” is a misnomer as Science has now already proved that the second stage of photosynthesis isn’t really light-independent reactions. Though it doesn’t need direct light, indirect light is involved even in this process. We choose to label this stage of photosynthesis as the “2nd stage: CARBON-FIXATION REACTION STAGE”, which is also called: Calvin Cycle or “stromal reaction” as it manifests in the stroma part of the chloroplast “C3 Cycle” or the “reductive pentose phosphate cycle” Figure 18: Illustration for an overview of the Calvin Cycle. Image Credit: . Calvin cycle The inputs for the in most plants come from the previously occurred photochemical reaction. In this cycle, the carbon dioxide produced is fixed to a glucose molecule. To be very specific, the Calvin cycle directly doesn’t produce glucose, rather it produces (G-3-P). Glucose is formed after these G-3-P molecules move into the cytosol from the chloroplast. It consists of primarily 3 steps as follows: Carboxylation: Acceptance of CO2 by RuBP which is a 5-carbon compound and the CO2-acceptor). 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate are generated as the result of the carboxylation process. Reduction: Generation of 3C/4C/5C/6C/7C molecules. Regeneration of RUBP: 3 molecules of RuBP are regenerated. In totality, 3 molecules of CO2 produce 1 molecule of G-3-P. This uses 9 ATPs and 6 NADPHs. And, 6 molecules of CO2 produce 2 molecules of G-3-P which further produce 1 molecule of glucose. This uses 18ATPs and 12 NADPHs. The main enzyme is . It’s a multi-enzyme complex with 8 large and 8 small subunits. The substrates for this enzyme are CO2, O2, and RuBP. An essential ion for the biological functioning of this enzyme: Mg2+. The role of RuBisCo is that it captures carbon dioxide gas from the atmosphere and utilizes the NADPH from the 1st stage (photochemical reaction/light-dependent reaction stage) to fix the CO2. The equation of dark reaction of photosynthesis/light-independent reaction stage/2nd stage is: 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O The simple carbon sugars formed via the C3 cycle are utilized by the biological systems to form complex organic compounds like cellulose, precursors for amino acids synthesis and thereby proteins, precursors for lipids, and the source of fuel for respiration. Important Point To Note: It happens in all the photosynthetic organisms as the basic carbon-fixation step. Figure 19: The important steps of the Calvin cycle are shown. Image Credit: . Carbon concentrating mechanisms There are many carbon concentrating mechanisms to increase the carbon dioxide levels and the carbon fixation process like C4, CAM, etc. Hatch and Slack cycle, C4 cycle, co-operative photosynthesis, CO2-enrichment cycle. Doesn’t happen in all photosynthetic organisms. Rather it happens in conjunction with the C3 cycle in some 4% of angiosperm families. Most commonly angiosperm families that witness C4 cycle: Poaceae, Cyperaceae. First explained by: Hatch and Slack (hence also called the Hatch and Slack cycle). They worked on the maize plant. Role: Endow the ability to efficiently conduct photosynthesis in plants of the semi-arid regions by making them well adapted. Mechanism: By separation of photosynthesis stages in 2 types of cells (mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells). The light reaction is restricted to the mesophyll cells and the CO2 fixation happens in the bundle sheath cells. This phenomenon is also termed as “chloroplast dimorphism” in C4 plants. The Kranz anatomy is visible here. Why does the need arise in the first place? – In semi-arid regions or regions with very hot and dry environmental conditions, plants are forced to close their stomata in order to limit water loss. Under such harsh conditions, the intake of CO2 decreases during the day as the stomata are forced closed. This might lead to no CO2 intake and hence no CO2 fixation (2nd stage of photosynthesis). But the 1st stage of photosynthesis keeps running as it doesn’t depend on stomata opening or closure. This means that a continuous oxygen evolution happens which can lead to oxygen saturation. As we know that RuBisCo enzymes use O2 gas as substrate too, and this can lead to an increased rate of by the oxygenase activity of RuBisCo. This further decreases the carbon fixation. This is a very big issue if not resolved. Hence, for situations like these, carbon concentrating mechanisms have evolved in some families of plants to concentrate and enrich the CO2 concentration in the leaves of these plants under such conditions. Important enzyme for CO2 concentration: PEP carboxylase CO2 is first added to a three-carbon compound called (PEP) in this cycle. This leads to the formation of a four-carbon (4C) molecule called oxaloacetic acid or malate. This step happens in the of the leaves. After that, these 4C compounds are transferred to the bundle sheath cells where the normal C3 cycle fixes them into glucose molecules. This CO2 concentrating mechanism works on the “principle of separating the RuBisCo enzyme from the O2-generating photochemical reactions” in order to reduce the rates of photorespiration and simultaneously increase the rates of CO2 fixation. This increases the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf/leaf photosynthesis. When the high light and high-temperature conditions are dominant, C4 plants prove more photosynthetically efficient than C3 plants as they produce more sugar molecules in such conditions. Examples of C4 plants: Many crop plants like wheat, maize, rice, sorghum, millet, and sugarcane. Number of ATPs required: 12 (for C-enrichment) + 18 (for C-fixation)= 30 ATPS for 1 glucose production Number of NADPH required: 18 NADPH for 1 glucose production Figure 20: C4 plant cycle. Notice the separation of early and late steps in space. The spatial separation between mesophyll cells and bundle sheath cells helps in increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of the C4 plants. Image Credit: . CAM Cycle Some plants resort to another mechanism called the CAM cycle in conjunction with the C3 cycle to fix carbon dioxide. Examples: like cactus photosynthesis, and most succulents. Around 16,000 species of plants utilize the CAM mechanism Mechanism: Utilize PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide. In contrast to the C4 cycle where there is a “spatial separation of the 2 processes of CO2 reduction to PEP and PEP fixation to glucose”, CAM plants display a “temporal separation of the 2 listed processes”. Figure 21: CAM plants differ from C3 and C4 as they display temporal (time) separation of the carbon fixation process steps. Image Credit: . On land Land plants display different types of photosynthesis based on their requirements and environmental constraints. They are C3, C4 +C3, and CAM+ C3 types of photosynthesis. In water Aquatic plants and algae display some extra features in the photosynthetic machinery. These features further refine and define the smooth functioning and efficiency of photosynthesis. Example: Cyanobacteria photosynthesis – cyanobacteria have that help in enriching the concentration of carbon dioxide around the RuBisCO enzyme. This directly increases the photosynthetic rates. The distinguished and specially enabled enzyme in the carboxysomes is called “carbonic anhydrase”. The carbonic anhydrase possesses the ability to evolve and release CO2 from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO-). As soon as the CO2 is released, RuBisCo takes care that it doesn’t go to waste. Figure 22: Notice the role of carbonic anhydrase in releasing CO2 from the dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO-). Image Credit: . Order and Kinetics There are innumerable reactions and processes involved in the biological mechanism of photosynthesis. Besides the normal flow of photosynthesis, there are some plant-specific and condition-specific additional steps that further complicate the mechanism. Since every biological mechanism has a lot of enzymes, factors, cofactors, substrates, and entities involved, photosynthesis is no different. Let’s try to list some kinetics-specific pointers that may help. The chemical process of photosynthesis doesn’t always include the “evolution of oxygen gas”. This is so because there’s an anoxygenic type of photosynthesis too. So the normal equation of photosynthesis is: Figure 23: Equation of photosynthesis. Image Source: of Biology Online The equation of oxygenic photosynthesis takes into account the photolysis of water as well as the evolution of oxygen gas. Look at the equation below. Figure 24: Equation of oxygenic photosynthesis. Image Source: of Biology Online Photosynthetic Photochemical Reaction Centre (PCRC) and Antenna Complexes: Only chlorophyll-a is present at the PCRC, while all the other chlorophyll molecules (b, c, d) are present at the antenna complex. The precise role of these antenna complex pigments is to deliver the extra energy which is needed at the reaction center for extracting the electrons from the H2O (e- donor). Figure 25: PCRC and AC in the photosynthetic machinery. Image Source: of Biology Online Photo-protection mechanism of Carotenoids: Although we like to credit chlorophylls for all the major responsibilities of photosynthesis, carotenoids serve an indispensable role that shouldn’t be ignored. Figure 26: The flowchart shows how carotenoids maintain the order of photosynthesis by continuously tacking the excited state of chlorophyll molecules. If not tackled, it can lead to two dangerous consequences. By the intervention of carotenoids, although heat is produced, no ROS production happens or at least it’s minimized. Image Source: of Biology Online Evolution As discussed in the overview and starting of this article, the early photosynthetic organisms must have been primarily “anoxygenic” in nature. These bacteria used some other source than water molecules as their primary electron donors. Even the geological evidence aligns with this fact as the early atmosphere of Earth was highly reducing in nature. Some speculated organisms of the early evolutionary phase are : Green sulfur bacteria (Electron donor= hydrogen and sulfur) Purple sulfur bacteria (Electron donor= hydrogen and sulfur) Green nonsulfur bacteria (Electron donor= various amino and other organic acids) Purple nonsulfur bacteria (Electron donor= variety of nonspecific organic molecules) After this, some filamentous photosynthetic organisms are expected to have evolved. This is scaled to be an occurrence of some 3.4 billion years old timeline. It is around 2 million years ago that oxygenic photosynthesis is believed to have evolved. The modern and more commonly known photosynthesis in plants and most of the photosynthetic prokaryotes= Oxygenic (Electron donor= Water molecules) Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts There are some animal groups that have the ability to form and establish with photosynthetic organisms. By establishing such a relationship, these organisms can directly rely upon their photosynthetic partner for energy and food requirements. Some examples of such animal groups are: Corals Sponges Sea anemones Marine mollusks (example: Elysia viridis & Elysia chlorotica) Fungi photosynthesis (Lichens) When such symbiotic relationships are established, it’s sometimes observed that some genes of the plant cell’s get transferred to the . (Observed in some slugs). Figure 27: Photosynthetic slug because of the symbiotic relationship that it forms with algae. Image Credit: Origin of Chloroplasts Such symbiosis is popularly claimed to be the source of chloroplast evolution. As we notice many similarities between the photosynthetic bacteria and chloroplasts, the evolution of chloroplasts is often hinted to have occurred from these bacteria. Some of the common features between the 2 are: Circular chromosome Prokaryotic-type A similar set of proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center It is for all these commonalities the “” had been proposed for the evolution of chloroplasts and mitochondria in the eukaryotic cells. According to the endosymbiotic theory, the early eukaryotic cells are believed to have acquired the photosynthetic bacteria by the process of endocytosis). Those early eukaryotic cells after acquiring the photosynthetic bacteria transformed to be self-sustainable and became the “first plant cells”. (Mitochondria photosynthesis is true, they are associated with respiration!) Figure 28: Endosymbiotic theory. Image Credit: . Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages include: Glaucophytes Chlorophytes Rhodophytes Cryptophytes (some clades) Haptophytes (some clades) Dinoflagellates & chromerids Euglenids—clade Excavata (unicellular) Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis Almost all the prokaryotes carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis in contrast to cyanobacteria, which perform oxygenic photosynthesis. This ability to carry out oxygenic photosynthesis is speculated to have evolved at least 2450–2320 million years ago. The first photosynthetic cyanobacteria might not have been oxygenic as Earth’s atmosphere had no oxygen then. This topic still requires more scientific study to bring out conclusive results. From the paleontological evidence, it is claimed that the 1st cyanobacteria evolved around 2000 Ma. For the initial years of the Earth’s oxygen-rich environment (after the oxygen-evolving mechanism evolved), cyanobacteria are claimed to be the “principal primary producers of oxygen”. Even to date, cyanobacteria have been proven vital for marine ecosystems. They’re the primary producers of oxygen in oceans. Cyanobacteria also fix nitrogen electrons fixation and play a role in biological nitrogen cycles. Experimental History We will list the long experimental history in deciphering the extensive photosynthesis process through the ages. Discovery, Refinements, and Development of the concept Find out the discovery, refinements, and development of photosynthesis as summarized in the table below: Experimental History – Photosynthesis No. Scientist Contribution 1 Stephen Hales Role of air and light in building a plant body. 2 Joseph Priestley Role of air in the growth of green plants. 3 Jan Ingenhousz Role of sunlight in the plant’s functioning of releasing oxygen. 4 Jene Senebier The fact that plants utilize CO2. 5 N.T. de Saussure The volume of CO2 consumed by plants=Volume of O2 liberated by plants. 6 Pelletier and Caventou Coined the term “chlorophyll”. 7 F.F. Blackman Photosynthesis= 2-step process (Light and Dark Reaction Concept), Gave the “Law of limiting factors”. 8 Warburg Flashing experiments in Chlorella. 9 Emerson and Arnold Determined that the 1st stage of photochemical/light reactions has 2 distinct photochemical processes. (led to the elucidation of 2 different pigment systems) 10 Robert Hill Proved that oxygen evolution doesn’t require the presence of CO2. The presence of sunlight, water, and a suitable hydrogen acceptor is enough chloroplasts to release oxygen. The light reaction (1st stage) is often called Hill’s reaction in his memory and honor. 11 Van Niel Proved that the source of oxygen is H2O and not CO2. Also proved that the hydrogen released from oxidizable compounds reduced carbon dioxide to carbohydrates. 12 Ruben, Hassid, Kamen Proved that the source of oxygen is H2O (by doing radioactive studies). 13 Julius von Sachs Photosynthesis site in plants= Green parts where chlorophyll is present. 14 T.W. Engelmann Described the importance of the red and blue wavelengths of light. Also described the 1st action spectrum of photosynthesis 15 Melvin Calvin Described the reactions that convert the CO2 into sugars. C3 or Calvin cycle is named in his honor. 16 M.D. Hatch and C.R. Slack Described the C4 cycle and hence the C4 cycle is also called Hatch and Slack cycle. 17 Hill and Bendall Proposed scheme of light reaction. 18 Huber et al. Studied 3-D structure of reaction center. 19 Charles Reid Barnes Coined the terms: Photosyntax and photosynthesis. Data Source: of Biology Online C3 : C4 photosynthesis research Several studies were conducted using isotopes of radioactive elements to identify the various aspects of the photosynthetic process. A number of organisms like Chlorella, Stellaria media, Cladophora, Spirogyra, Rhodopseudomonas, sulfur bacteria, green plants like maize, etc have been used to understand the photosynthesis process over the years. Gas exchange studies, isotopic studies, light spectrum studies, radioactive studies, plant anatomical and physiological studies, studies involving roles of carbon dioxide and water, etc have all together opened the gates for our deeper understanding of this topic. Factors The 3 main factors that directly affect the photosynthesis process are: Light irradiance and wavelength Carbon dioxide concentration Temperature Although there are many more corollary factors, these 3 are the most important ones. Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength, and temperature Light is an essential factor for photosynthesis. It directly affects the rate of it. There are 3 different parameters that we should look into: Light intensity: Optimum light intensity varies from plant to plant. There are 2 types of plants based on the intensity of light they optimally need to grow under. Sciophytes: Grow under “diffuse” light. Example: Oxalis Heliophytes: Grow under “direct: light. Example: Dalbergia Light quality: PAR as previously discussed is the quality or the fraction of light energy that is ‘photosynthetically active’ in nature. It ranges from 400-700nm in wavelength. Duration of light: This parameter doesn’t affect the rate of photosynthesis but affects the total photosynthetic output. Temperature Temperature is another very important factor for photosynthesis. The carbon dioxide fixation stage (dark reactions) is affected by the temperature. The optimum temperature range is 20-25°C for the C3 plants. The optimum temperature range for C4 plants is a little higher ranging from 30-45 °C. Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Carbon dioxide concentration is the major factor in determining the rate of photosynthesis. There is no carbon-dioxide enriching system in C3 plants like the C4 plants. So, if you increase the concentration of CO2 in the system, the photosynthetic rate of C3 plants will increase as the CO2 concentration increases. On the other hand, the photosynthetic yield of the C4 plant won’t increase in such a scenario. CO2 Compensation Point: A stage in CO2 concentration when there’s no absorption of CO2 by the illuminated plant part. Featuring… “The curious case of RuBisCO and PEP Carboxylase” Imagine an equal concentration (50-50%) of the two isotopes of carbon, C-12 and C-13, in the form of 12CO2 and 13CO2, made available to both C3 and C4 plants. Now, can you tell which isotope of the carbon will be fixed more or less by the two types of photosynthetic organisms? Can you guess if there would be a “preferable” isotope between the two? Do you think C3 plants will fix the 12CO2 and 13CO2 equally or unequally? Or do you think the 12CO2 and 13CO2 incorporation would have a biased ratio in any of the two (C3/C4 plants)???? The answer to this lies in the major carbon fixing enzyme involved. C3 plants: Major C-fixing enzyme is RuBisCo and RuBisCo has a “discriminatory ability” to preferably fix 12CO2 and not 13CO2. Hence, you will find more 12CO2 fixed than 13CO2 in the C3 plants. C4 plants: Major C-fixing enzyme is not RuBisCo but PEP Carboxylase. PEP Carboxylase has “no discriminatory ability”. So, you’ll find an almost equal proportion of 12CO2 and 13CO2 getting fixed in C4 plants. So, in comparison to C3 plants, the chances of getting 13CO2 fixed are more in C4 plants.

TRANSCRIPT Photosynthesis is a biochemical process used by green plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria to capture energy from light and store it in chemical compounds that fuel biological functions. For example, land plants use water from the soil, carbon dioxide from the air, and energy from the sun to synthesize glucose, which fuels plant growth, development and physiology. The oxygen gas we breathe is released as a byproduct of this process. 9.1: What is Photosynthesis? Photosynthesis is a multipart, biochemical process that occurs in plants as well as in some bacteria. It captures carbon dioxide and solar energy to produce glucose. Glucose stores chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. The overall biochemical formula of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere and is largely responsible for maintaining the Earth’s atmospheric oxygen content. Photosynthetic reactions occur in chloroplasts, specialized membrane-enclosed compartments in the plant cell. Chloroplasts consist of coin-like stacks of thylakoids. One such stack is called a granum. The thylakoid membranes are enriched with chlorophyll, a green pigment that gives plants and especially their leaves their green color. The chlorophyll molecule absorbs light energy in the form of photons from violet-blue, and orange and red wavelengths. The photons initiate a cascade that powers the reactions of Photosystem II and Photosystem I that produce ATP and NADPH. These two molecules are then used to power the light-independent reactions of the Calvin Cycle that take place in the stroma of the chloroplast to produce complex carbohydrates. Some plants, like corn and cacti that grow in dry, hot climates, use modified carbon-fixing processes to produce sugars, such as the C4 and CAM pathways. These climate adaptations reduce photorespiration—a process where the enzyme rubisco binds O2 and burns sugar rather than producing it by binding CO2. CAM and C4 plants separate CO2 fixation and glucose synthesis in time, or by using specialized cell compartments for both processes.

By Reviewed by Photosynthesis is a chemical process by which plants, some bacteria, and algae convert energy derived from sunlight to chemical energy. This is an important process for biological life on earth because it allows energy from sunlight to be harnessed and transferred into a form that can be utilized by organisms to fuel their activity. Photosynthesis process diagram illustration vector design. Image Credit: tuksaporn rattanamuk / Shutterstock The energy from photosynthesis is stored within carbohydrate molecules, which can be kept within an organism until it is needed. The carbohydrate molecules can later be utilized as energy by the organism with a chemical process such as respiration, producing byproducts - carbon dioxide and water. There are 2 types of photosynthe sis known as oxygenic and anoxygenic photosynthesis, depending on whether oxygen is produced in the reaction. Both these types will be covered in more detail below. 3 Amazing Photosynthetic AnimalsPlay Oxygenic Photosynthesis The most common type of photosynthesis is oxygenic photosynthesis, which is commonly seen in algae, plants, and cyanobacteria. In this process, energy from light is utilized to transfer electrons from H2O molecules to carbon dioxide (CO2). In this reaction, carbon dioxide is reduced because it receives electrons while water is oxidized because it loses electrons. As a result of the reaction, oxygen and carbohydrates are produced. Oxygenic photosynthesis serves to balance the transfer of energy that occurs during the process of respiration. All living and breathing organisms inhale oxygen from the air to produce energy and exhale carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis replaces oxygen in the air with the assistance of energy from sunlight. In the absence of oxygenic photosynthesis, atmospheric oxygen would eventually be depleted. Oxygenic Photosynthesis Equation Oxygenic photosynthesis is a complex process with multiple steps. However, the overall process can be summarized using the following chemical equation: 6CO2 + 12H2O + Light Energy à C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O Related StoriesIn the complete reaction, six carbon dioxide molecules combine with twelve molecules of water in the presence of sunlight, which provides the energy for the reaction to occur. As a result, a single glucose molecule, six oxygen molecules, and six molecules of water are formed. Anoxygenic Photosynthesis Anoxygenic photosynthesis utilizes electrons from molecules other than water to create chemical energy from light. This process usually happens in certain types of bacteria, as in, green sulfur bacteria and purple bacteria. Importantly, oxygen is not produced during anoxygenic photosynthesis . The end product depends on the molecule that is the electron donor. As an example, bacteria may take the electrons from and oxidize a molecule such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to produce energy and solid sulfur (S) as a byproduct. Anoxygenic Photosynthesis Equation Similar to oxygenic photosynthesis, there is a complex process with multiple steps for anoxygenic photosynthesis, which can be summarized with the following chemical equation: CO2 + 2H2A + Light Energy à CH2O + 2A + H2O In this equation, “A” is a variable that may represent any element in the molecule of the electron donor. As an example, the ‘A’ may be the sulfur in the reaction to convert one molecule of carbon dioxide and two molecules of hydrogen sulfide into the end products.

All animals, including humans, eat food that was, or is, a plant or an animal.But green plants and algae can use light energy to make their own food! This process called photosynthesis. Almost all life on Earth depends upon this process.BBCThese are the things that plants need for photosynthesis:carbon dioxidewaterlightThese are the things that plants make by photosynthesis:glucose (sugar)oxygenHere is the word equation for photosynthesis:Photosynthesis takes place inside chloroplasts which are small objects inside plant cells. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This traps the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. Plants and algae can only carry out photosynthesis in the light.A Plant CellStructureFunctionCell wallThe outside of the cell which provides support and prevents the cell from bursting from the uptake of water.Cell membraneA selectively permeable membrane surrounding the cell that controls the entry and exit of materials.NucleusThe control centre of the cell. It controls what happens inside the cell and holds instructions needed to make new cells. The plural of nucleus is nuclei.CytoplasmThe living substance inside a cell. Cell reactions happen here.ChloroplastsContains chlorophyll, a green pigment that traps light energy to make food during photosynthesisVacuoleA space within the cytoplasm of plant cells that contains cell sap.Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the Sun.The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch and plant oils, which are used as an energy store. The glucose is also used to release energy through the process of respiration.Why is photosynthesis so important?Photosynthesis is really important for animals, including humans becausewithout photosynthesis we wouldn’t have food because it converts energy from the sun into chemical energy for the food chains.photosynthesis keeps the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in balance – without it we would very quickly run out of oxygen.Photosynthesis is really important for the plant because it provides the plant with food:some of the glucose is used immediately, to give the plant energy in the process of respiration.some of the glucose is changed into starch and stored in all parts of the plant. When it is needed, it is converted back into glucose.to-topBack to topAdaptations of the leafIn most plants photosynthesis happens in the leaves. Leaves have adapted so that photosynthesis takes place efficiently. The table describes some of its adaptations:AdaptationFunctionThinProvides a short distance for carbon dioxide to move by diffusion into the leafLarge surface areaIt can absorb a lot of lightContains chlorophyllTraps lightStomataSmall holes in the underside of the leaf that allow carbon dioxide and oxygen to move in and out of the leaf by diffusionGuard cellsTo open and close the stomata depending on the conditionsNetwork of tubesTo transport water and foodto-topBack to topLightA leaf usually has a large surface area, so that it can absorb a lot of light. It's top surface is protected from water loss, disease and weather damage by a waxy cuticle, which does not stop light entering the leaf.The upper part of the leaf is where the light falls, and it contains many cells called palisade cells. This has many chloroplasts, with lots of chlorophyll to trap as much light as possible. It is shaped like a tall box which helps pack them closely together.Carbon dioxidePlants get the carbon dioxide they need from the air through their leaves. It moves by diffusion through small holes in the underside of the leaf called stomata. Guard cells control the size of the stomata so that the leaf does not lose too much water in hot, windy or dry conditions.The lower part of the leaf is a spongy layer with loose-fitting cells. Between the cells in this layer there are 'air spaces' - a bit like a sponge. These allow the gases to diffuse through the leaf. Stomata let carbon dioxide enter the leaf, and let the oxygen produced in photosynthesis leave the leaf easily. In many plants, stomata are open during the day and closed at night.WaterThe water needed for photosynthesis is absorbed through the roots and transported through tubes to the leaf. The roots have a type of cell called a root hair cell. These project out from the root into the soil, and have a big surface area and thin walls. This lets water pass into them easily. Note that root cells do not contain chloroplasts, as they are normally in the dark and cannot carry out photosynthesis.Water is absorbed from the soil by root hair cellsPhotosynthesis and respiration in plantsPlant cells respire, just as animal cells do. If they stop respiring, they will die. Remember that respiration happens in all living cells and is the way that energy is released from glucose - it is not the same as breathing, so take care - plants do not breathe! Here is the word equation for aerobic respiration: glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energyHere is the word equation for photosynthesis:The word equations show that the reactants and products of aerobic respiration and photosynthesis are opposites:aerobic respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxidephotosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and produces oxygenPlants respire all the time, whether it is dark or light. They photosynthesise only when they are in the light.to-topBack to topHydrogencarbonate indicatorHydrogencarbonate indicator can detect increases and decreases in carbon dioxide concentration.Hydrogencarbonate indicator is normally red.An increase in carbon dioxide changes the indicator to yellowA decrease in carbon dioxide changes it to purpleIf there are no change in the carbon dioxide levels then the indicator remains red.to-topBack to topWhen photosynthesis and respiration happen.Photosynthesis only happens in the light. Respiration happens all the time.In bright lightBoth photosynthesis and respiration are occurring but the rate of photosynthesis is higher than the rate of respiration, therefore there is more carbon dioxide into the leaf and oxygen out.The removal of carbon dioxide from the hydrogencarbonate indicator into the leaf would change the indicator from red to purple.At dusk/dawn When light intensity is low the rates of photosynthesis and respiration are equal. There is no net exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen.No net gas exchange would cause the hydrogencarbonate to remain red because no change in carbon dioxide concentration will occur.In the dark Only respiration is occurring as there is no light for photosynthesis, therefore the only gas exchange happening is oxygen into and carbon dioxide out of the leaf.The release of carbon dioxide from the leaf into the hydrogencarbonate indicator changes the indicator from red to yellow.ConditionsPhotosynthesis v respirationOverall resultHydrogen carbonate indicatorDarkRespiration but no photosynthesisOxygen taken in, carbon dioxide given outYellowDim light (e.g. dawn or dusk)Photosynthesis rate equals respiration rateNo overall exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygenRedBright lightPhotosynthesis rate greater than respiration rateCarbon dioxide taken in, oxygen given outPurpleWhen the rate of photosynthesis is greater than the rate of respiration, then there is a gain in glucose.Plants that lose their leaves in winter store food produced during the summer by photosynthesis. They store enough food to last them over winter, and to provide energy reserves for new growth in the spring. They are called deciduous plants.to-topBack to topInvestigating photosynthesis: Testing a leaf for starchDuring photosynthesis carbon dioxide and water are converted to glucose. The glucose is normally quickly converted into starch, for storage in the leaves.So, if a plant has photosynthesised its leaves will test positive for starch.Destarching a plant:Before carrying out any photosynthesis practical it is necessary to destarch the plant by placing it in the dark for at least 48 hours. During this time any starch will be turned back into glucose and used by respiration.This step is important so you can be certain that any starch present at the end of the experiment has been produced during the experiment.You can check if a plant has been fully destarched by testing a leaf for starch. If the iodine remains yellow-brown, all the starch has successfully been removed.to-topBack to topThe starch test:First destarch the plant – see aboveStand a plant in bright light for at least two hours.After that time, remove a leaf from the plant.Place the leaf in boiling water for 30 seconds (diagram 1 above) – this kills it, stopping any further chemical reactions.Place the leaf in boiling ethanol (diagram 2 above) – this removes the chlorophyll, making the leaf paler in colour.Then dip the leaf in water (diagram 3 above) – this softens it.Spread the leaf onto a white tile and add iodine to test for the presence of starch.Results:If starch is present the iodine will change from yellow-brown to blue-black.If starch is absent the iodine will remain yellow-brown.Safety:Wear goggles throughout the experiment, Ensure that the ethanol is not exposed to a naked flame during step 5, as it is highly flammable. It should be heated using a hot water bath instead of using a Bunsen burnerShowing that light and chlorophyll are required for photosynthesisTwo straightforward investigations can be carried out to show that light and chlorophyll are required for photosynthesis.to-topBack to topShowing the need for light in photosynthesisMethodDestarch a plant in the normal way (see above)Cover part of a leaf with lightproof paper or foil.Make a drawing of the leaf to show where the foil/paper is placed.Place the plant in bright light for several hours.Test the leaf for starch using the starch test (see above).Make another drawing of the leaf. In this drawing show the areas of the leaf that tested positive and those that tested negative for starch.ResultsOnly the area that have been exposed to light tested positive for starch and hence showed that photosynthesis had occurred. This shows that light is necessary for photosynthesis.Showing the need for chlorophyll in photosynthesisMethodDestarch a plant with variegated leaves. Variegated leaves are not completely green, as can be seen in the diagram. these discoloured areas do not contain chlorophyll.Make a drawing of the leaf to show the pattern of the variegated leaf.Place the plant in light for several hours.Test the leaf for starch using the starch test (see above).Make another drawing of the leaf. In this drawing show the areas of the leaf that tested positive and those that tested negative of starch.Results Only the areas of the leaf that were originally green tested positive for starch. The discoloured areas tested negative. As the green areas contained chlorophyll and the white did not, this proves that chlorophyll is needed for photosynthesis.Investigating the production of oxygenIf the rate of photosynthesis increases (e.g. by increasing the brightness of the lamp) the number of oxygen bubbles or volume of oxygen produced will also increase.Measuring the volume of oxygen produced is more accurate than counting the bubbles of oxygen produced.An oxygen electrode connected to a data logger can be used to measure the change in oxygen concentration.To test for oxygen remove the test tube and quickly inset a glowing wooden splint. This relights in a test tube of oxygen.to-topBack to topSummary: Comparing photosynthesis and respirationPhotosynthesisRespirationGas taken inCarbon dioxideOxygenGas given outOxygenCarbon dioxideWhat does the gas react with?WaterGlucoseWhat else is produced?GlucoseWaterOccurs inOnly plant cells containing chlorophyllAll living cellsWhen does it take place?Only in light (day) onlyIn light (day) as well as in the dark (night)Energy changeLight energy → Chemical energyChemical energy in food → Chemical energy that cells can use + heat energy + kinetic energyWord equationcarbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygenglucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water + energyPlant adaption for photosynthesis to occurDifferent types of plants live in different conditions and different habitats.

We have to have a safe surface so they're not getting injured, missing a shot, costing your team a chance for a win, the chance for a trophy.I'm Nathan Scarff, and I'm the Head Groundsman in Derby County Football Club.Working inside a stadium, we have a really big shade issue. The darkest area in this pitch will never see any sunlight. The plants struggle to photosynthesise naturally, so we use the lights to effectively synthetically induce the photosynthesis process and create the growth, so it gives the plant a lot of light energy and also some heat as well to encourage growth.We are looking for just a healthy plant, something that's strong, something that's durable, something that would recover well. The sciences that we use is predominately biology, we have a variety of measuring tools, we'll measure the moisture, the length of the grass, the hardness of the surface, everything is about producing absolute uniformity.The first year that we had these lights, we won the award for best pitch in the championship. You do take a lot of pride away on what you do.Can you answer these questions based on the video?1. Derby County FC has a very big shade issue with regards to the growth of their grass pitch. What do they use to overcome this problem?2.

Oxygen is a product of photosynthesis and is needed for respiration. All organisms respire to release energy and to stay alive. Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would come to an end, as almost every food chain depends on it either directly or indirectly. Producers such as algae, seaweed, grasses and phytoplankton all require photosynthesis to make their own food.Photosynthesis brings about a balance in the ecosystem as it decreases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Together with other processes such as respiration and combustion, it can help to maintain levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Without photosynthesis we wouldn’t have fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum, as these were formed from photosynthetic processes. These non-renewable sources were made by the breakdown of older plants.Plant products such as timber, rubber and oil also require photosynthesis to be made.If a plant cannot photosynthesise, it will dieto-topBack to topPlants and animals working togetherThe composition of the atmosphere has changed since the Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago. Natural processes, such as photosynthesis, have contributed to maintaining the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, required for survival.Plants release oxygen into the atmosphere as a by-product of photosynthesis and processes such as respiration and decomposition release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These processes work symbiotically, where plants and animals depend on each other to benefit from this. Plants need the carbon dioxide released by respiration and decomposition, whereas animals need the oxygen released by plants from photosynthesis. This cycle helps maintain the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.Video - Golden jellyfishProfessor Brian Cox sees photosynthesis in action, investigating a unique type of jellyfishVideo TranscriptupdownProfessor Brian Cox: All life depends on the flow of energy, which gets passed from one life-form to another. And there is one creature that embodies more than most just how that happens. This is the Golden Jellyfish.A unique subspecies only found in this one lake, on this one island, in the tiny Micronesian republic of Palau. Golden Jellyfish have evolved to do something that very few other animals can do.' It really is incredible. As far as you can see, all the way down, till the light vanishes, there are jellyfish. And you can see they've congregated in the sun. If you go over there, to where the lake's in shade there are just none. And then in this pool of light beneath the sun, there are millions of them. Beautifully elegant things just floating around.This lake is home to over 20 million jellyfish, whose success comes down to a remarkable adaptation. Their bodies play host to thousands of other organisms. Photosynthetic algae that harvest energy directly from sunlight. And once harvested, it's passed on to the jellyfish to use.The energy flows from sun, to algae, to jellyfish.' The ones at the surface are gently turning and, the reason they do that is to give all their algae an equal dose of sunlight. 'And it's not just their anatomy that's adapted to harvest solar energy. Every morning, as the sun rises the jellyfish begin to swim towards the east.' And as the sun tracks across the sky, they move back again towards the west where they spend their night. So, the jellyfish have this beautiful, intimate, and complex relationship with the position of the sun in the sky. 'As sunlight is captured by their algae it's converted into chemical energy. Energy they use to combine simple molecules, water and carbon dioxide, to produce a far more complex one: glucose. Once absorbed by the jellyfish, glucose, and other molecules, not only power their daily voyage across the lake, they provide the basic building blocks the jellyfish use to grow the elegant and complex structures of their bodies.So, the jellyfish, through their symbiotic algae, absorb the light, the energy, from the sun, and they use it to, well to live, to power their processes of life. And that's true, directly or indirectly, for every form of life on the surface of our planet. 'The sun's energy that bathes the Earth is harnessed by photosynthesis.Once transformed, it's passed on from one lifeform to another as food. The flow of energy animates all living things.The golden jellyfish has evolved to carry algae within their bodies and feed off the glucose the plants create.The jellyfish move towards the light of the Sun throughout the day to increase photosynthesis. The symbiotic relationship between the two species allows the jellyfish to live off the glucose the algae produce.to-topBack to topUses of glucoseGlucose is a useful molecule that is made during the process of photosynthesis. The initial use for glucose, when broken down during respiration, is to release energy. Glucose is a molecule that can be bonded together to make many types of carbohydrates including cellulose and starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals). Think of it like each glucose molecule being an individual bead on a necklace and the entire necklace represents the carbohydrate molecule.Plants only photosynthesise and synthesise glucose during the day when there is sunlight, but they use glucose for respiration all the time, including during the night.CelluloseGlucose is used to make cellulose. Cellulose is an example of a natural polymer. Cellulose is the main component found in plant cell walls and this gives the plant cell strength and support. Humans cannot digest cellulose, but it is important in your diet as fibre. Fibre assists your digestive system, keeping food moving through the gut and pushing waste out of the body.StarchOther uses of glucose produced from photosynthesis is to make the insoluble storage molecule starch. Most plants including rice, potatoes and wheat store their energy as starch. Starch is also a polymer and can be converted back to glucose by the plant when it is needed, for example at night for respiration.Fats and oilsGlucose can also be converted to fats and oils such as olive oil. Fats and oils are also used by the plant as a storage form of energy.Amino acidsGlucose produced in photosynthesis can be used to help make amino acids. These amino acids are used by the plant to synthesise proteins. Minerals such as nitrate ions are also absorbed by the roots of the plants to help make these amino acids. Foods such as peas are good protein sources.to-topBack to topTest your knowledgeto-topBack to topto-topBack to topBuild on your knowledge with these guides. Explore the BBCCopyright © 2023 BBC.

Leegood, in , 2013Harvesting LightLight HarvestingThe first step in photosynthesis is light absorption by pigments. Besides various types of chlorophyll, these pigments include carotenoids, and open-chain tetrapyrrole bilin pigments found in, for example, cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll is a pigment based on a tetrapyrrole ring, rather like hemoglobin, except that it contains magnesium rather than iron. The ring is linked to a long side chain. Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, while it transmits in the green, and hence appears green. In plants, two types of chlorophyll, a and b, increase the range of wavelengths absorbed. The light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules either can be lost as heat or fluorescence, or can be transferred between adjacent chlorophyll molecules by resonance transfer. Chlorophyll and carotenoids associate with proteins in light-harvesting complexes. The light-harvesting complexes have been crystallized from both bacteria and plants. A light-harvesting complex acts like an antenna, similar to a satellite dish, feeding photons into the reaction centers, which contain a dimeric form of chlorophyll, where charge separation occurs. The concept of an antenna arose from the discovery in 1932, by Emerson and Arnold, that only one CO2 molecule was produced from about 2500 chlorophyll molecules after a short flash of light.At a higher level of organization, the leaf and its cells are also adapted to harvest light efficiently. In shade, the photosynthetic apparatus is spread out in large thin leaves, to increase the area of light capture and to allow light to penetrate adequately, and there is more light-harvesting chlorophyll per antenna. Within the leaf, epidermal cells can act to focus light, elongated palisade cells act as light guides, whereas mesophyll cells reflect light, acting like a hall of mirrors and increasing the distance that photons travel, thereby increasing the chance that they will be intercepted by an antenna complex.Energy CaptureReaction centers are multisubunit protein complexes situated in the photosynthetic membrane. These complexes contain the reaction center chlorophylls as well as other components involved in electron transfer. The reaction center is the core of the photosynthetic process, converting the energy of sunlight into a usable chemical form. Reaction centers carry out light-driven electron-transfer reactions that result in charge separation across the photosynthetic membrane. Rapid electron transfer to secondary acceptors is necessary to prevent recombination of these separated charges. There are two classes of reaction centers with different terminal electron acceptors, those with Fe4S4 clusters (type 1) and those with pheophytin/quinones (type 2). In plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria, both reaction centers are present (in photosystems 1 and 2, respectively), whereas photosynthetic bacteria have only one type of reaction center (e.g., type 1 in green sulfur bacteria and type 2 in purple bacteria). In plants, photosystem 2 contains a chlorophyll dimer which, when in the excited state (P680*), is an extremely strong reducing agent. An acceptor molecule, a quinone, Q, becomes reduced, leaving the positively charged chlorophyll dimer (P680+). This is an extremely strong oxidant, so strong that it can extract electrons from water.Water OxidationWater oxidation is a unique feature of photosystem 2. Water is the electron donor for photosynthetic electron transport. Each photon absorbed by P680 enables it to extract one electron from a manganese-containing enzyme, in an oxygen-evolving complex. Once four electrons have been extracted, this complex can, in turn, oxidize water, releasing O2 to the atmosphere, as well as releasing 4H+ to the thylakoid lumen. Photosynthetic bacteria utilize other sources, such as H2S or organic compounds, as electron donors.Energy Dissipation and Reactive Oxygen SpeciesAlthough light is required for photosynthesis, too much light can be harmful. The generation of highly reactive intermediates in oxygenic photosynthesis can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species. To protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative damage, photosynthetic systems possess antioxidant systems that scavenge reactive oxygen species, as well as mechanisms that regulate photosynthesis to minimize their production. These mechanisms are particularly important in high light, when the absorption of light energy exceeds a plant's capacity for CO2 fixation (e.g., when CO2 uptake is limited by stomatal closure brought about by water stress). For example, besides acting as accessory pigments in the antenna, carotenoids also have a photoprotective role. When there is an excess of light energy, carotenoids can quench the excited triplet state of chlorophyll before it reacts with oxygen, forming destructive singlet-state oxygen. Carotenoids can also regulate energy flow in the antenna by dissipating excitation of the chlorophylls as heat (nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching). Energy dissipation is associated with the accumulation of the carotenoid, zeaxanthin, which is interconverted with another carotenoid, violaxanthin, in the xanthophyll cycle. Physical changes, such as chloroplast movements within cells and heliotropic leaf movements, can also reduce or enhance light absorption, and photorespiration can dissipate excess photosynthetic energy.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123786302000499Darrell Fleischman, in , 2012IIB Bacterial Reaction CentersHigher plants are not the only organisms that perform photosynthesis. Algae also do, as do many bacteria. In all of them, the energy of light is converted to chemical energy in photosynthetic reaction centers. These are membrane-bound oligomeric protein complexes which contain a chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll dimer known as a special pair. The special pair donates an electron to an acceptor molecule following absorption of a photon. The reaction centers of plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria resemble each other surprisingly closely. It has been suggested that they have evolved from a common ancestor. We will begin by describing bacterial reaction centers. Photosynthetic bacteria are described in more detail by Jones (2009) and Hunter et al. (2008) and reaction centers are discussed by Yocum (2008a).It has been possible to isolate many of the oligomeric protein complexes involved in photosynthesis by dissolving the membranes in detergent and purifying the complexes through chromatography and other techniques. The reaction centers of purple photosynthetic bacteria are embedded in the cell membrane or in the membranes of intracytoplasmic vesicles which are often called chromatophores. Hartmut Michel, Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber isolated reaction centers from the green-colored (!) purple bacterium Blastochloris viridis (formerly Rhodopseudomonas viridis), devised a way to crystallize them and determined their structure by x-ray diffraction (Diesenhofer and Michel, 1989). This was the first crystallization of a membrane protein and paved the way for determination of the structures of many prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins. In addition, the reaction center structure provided important insights into the general properties to be expected of integral membrane proteins. The Blc. viridis reaction center consists of four subunits. Subunits L and M have similar but not identical amino acid sequences. Each comprises five α-helices that cross the membrane. The co-factors that participate in electron transport are bound to the L and M subunits. Their arrangement is sketched in Fig. 51.2. The primary electron donor (known as P985 because a loss of optical density at 985 nm accompanies its photo-oxidation) is indeed a dimer, in this case of bacteriochlorophyll b. The reaction center also includes two additional molecules of bacteriochlorophyll b, two of bacteriopheophytin b, one molecule each of menaquinone, ubiquinone and carotenoid, and a non-heme ferrous iron ion. Bacteriopheophytin is similar to bacteriochlorophyll, but the Mg2+ is replaced by two protons. Surprisingly, the reaction center has approximate twofold symmetry. The electrons leaving P985 move down only the L side of the reaction center. The first electron transfer, to the accessory bacteriochlorophyll b, occurs within a few picoseconds (10−12 s). The electrons move to the bacteriopheophytin b associated with subunit L, to QA (menaquinone) and, finally, to QB (ubiquinone). Upon receiving two electrons (after two photoacts), the ubiquinone binds two protons from the periplasm as it is reduced to ubihydroquinone. The ubihydroquinone dissociates into the membrane and diffuses to a cytochrome bc1 complex, where it is re-oxidized. The reaction center also includes a cytochrome subunit containing four hemes, which is located on the periplasmic surface (facing the outside of the cell) of the membrane. The hemes donate electrons to oxidized P985. There is also an H subunit, which forms a sort of cap on the cytoplasmic side of the L and M subunits and is anchored to the membrane by a single membrane-spanning helix. Its function is not known. Purple bacterial reaction centers are embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane or in the membranes of intracellular vesicles which are often termed chromatophores.FIGURE 51.2. The arrangement of the co-factors in the Blastochloris viridis reaction center. The reaction center has approximate twofold (C2) symmetry, but electrons move only along the path indicated. After QB accepts two electrons, two protons from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are bound. P985, the photochemically active bacteriochlorophyll b dimer; Bchl, bacteriochlorophyll b; BPheo, bacteriopheophytin b; QA, menaquinone; QB, ubiquinone; Fe, ferrous iron.Photosynthetic electron transport systems are capable of transporting electrons much more rapidly than photons of sunlight arrive at the special pairs. Therefore, reaction centers are accompanied by arrays of light-harvesting antenna pigments whose purpose is to capture photons and transfer the excitation energy to the special pairs. Purple bacterial reaction centers are surrounded by a “picket fence” of transmembrane dimers to which are bound bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid molecules. The monomers, designated α and β, comprise the LH1 (light-harvesting 1) complex (Fig. 51.3). The carotenoids absorb photons in the middle of the visible spectrum and quickly pass the excitation to the bacteriochlorophyll. The bacteriochlorophyll absorbs photons in the blue, red and near-infrared regions of the spectrum. The excitations become delocalized within the circle of bacteriochlorophylls within femtoseconds (10−15 s) and are transferred to the special air in tens of picoseconds, faster than many can be lost as heat or fluorescence. Details of these processes are discussed by Blankenship (2002).FIGURE 51.3. Light absorption and the transfer and capture of excitation energy. Protein dimers to which BChl and carotenoid molecules are bound form a ring around the reaction center. (Higher plant light harvesting pigments have a quite different structure.) Light is absorbed by any bacteriochlorophyll molecule (dark rectangles). The excitation energy is then delocalized among the bacteriochlorophyll molecules and finally captured by a special bacteriochlorophyll pair in the reaction center (RC). The figure is based on the structure of the bacterial light-harvesting complex reported by Cogdell et al. (1999).Other purple bacterial reaction centers have the same basic structure, but with variations. Most have bacteriochlorophyll α, bacteriopheophytin α and only ubiquinone. Many lack a bound cytochrome subunit. Observation of their topography by atomic force microscopy has revealed a variety of arrangements of LH1, including reaction centers multimers surrounded by continuous LH1 complexes (Sturgis and Niederman, 2008). Many have peripheral light-harvesting complexes, designated LH2, LH3, etc. Like LH1, they are composed of α and β subunits arranged in cylinders. They transfer absorbed excitations to LH1.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123877383000512GEORGE N. AGRIOS, in , 2005EFFECT OF PATHOGENS ON PHOTOSYNTHESISPhotosynthesis is the basic function of green plants: it enables them to transform light energy into chemical energy, which they can utilize in all cell activities. Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of nearly all energy used in all living cells, plant or animal, as all activities of living cells, except photosynthesis, expend the energy provided by photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil are brought together in the chloroplasts of the green parts of plants and, in the presence of light, react to form glucose with a concurrent release of oxygen:6CO2+6H2OlightchlorophyllC6H12O6+6O2In view of the fundamental position of photosynthesis in the life of plants, it is apparent that any interference by pathogens with photosynthesis results in a diseased condition in the plant. That pathogens do interfere with photosynthesis is obvious from the chlorosis they cause on many infected plants, from the necrotic lesions or large necrotic areas they produce on green plant parts, and from the reduced growth and amounts of fruits produced by many infected plants.In leaf spot, blight, and other kinds of diseases in which there is destruction of leaf tissue, e.g., in cereal rusts and fungal leaf spots (Figs. 3-1A–3-1C), bacterial leaf spots (Fig. 3-1D), viral mosaics (Fig. 3-1E) and yellowing and stunting diseases (Fig. 3-1F), or in defoliations, photosynthesis is reduced because the photosynthetic surface of the plant is lessened. Even in other diseases, however, plant pathogens reduce photosynthesis, especially in the late stages of diseases, by affecting the chloroplasts and causing their degeneration. The overall chlorophyll content of leaves in many fungal and bacterial diseases is reduced, but the photosynthetic activity of the remaining chlorophyll seems to remain unaffected. In some fungal and bacterial diseases, photosynthesis is reduced because the toxins, such as tentoxin and tabtoxin, produced by these pathogens inhibit some of the enzymes that are involved directly or indirectly in photosynthesis. In plants infected by many vascular pathogens, stomata remain partially closed, chlorophyll is reduced, and photosynthesis stops even before the plant eventually wilts. Most virus, mollicute, and nematode diseases also induce varying degrees of chlorosis and stunting. In the majority of such diseases, the photosynthesis of infected plants is reduced greatly. In advanced stages of disease, the rate of photosynthesis is no more than one-fourth the normal rate.FIGURE 3-1.

Goldschmidt-Clermont, in , 2017AbstractPhotosynthesis, the use of light energy to drive carbon fixation and the synthesis of organic compounds, is a central process in the biosphere. In eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place in a specialized organelle, the chloroplast, which has its own genetic system. The chloroplast genome contains only a small part of the genes required for photosynthesis; the others are encoded in the nuclear genome. As a consequence, the biogenesis of the photosynthetic machinery requires the coordinate expression of the two genomes. The genetics of photosynthesis addresses, first of all, the structural genes for the apoproteins of macromolecular complexes and enzymes that are required in the process. The genetic analysis also deals with genes for the synthesis of pigments and other cofactors, for the import of polypeptides in the chloroplast and targeting within the organelle, for the assembly and repair of the complexes, for the adaptation of photosynthesis to environmental conditions, and for many other facets. The genetics of photosynthesis also reveals loci required for the maintenance of the plastid, for the expression of the plastid genome, and for the regulation of plastid development.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338069028Sidney K. Pierce, Nicholas E. Curtis, in , 20122.4 Four levels of symbiotic plastid longevityPhotosynthesis, where ever it occurs, from bacteria to higher plants, including algae, requires at least the continuous replacement of chlorophyll and other pigments, as well as repair and replacement of the light-harvesting proteins (see, e.g., Beisel et al., 2010). So, while photosynthesis might continue for a while in the captured plastids on their own merits, continuation for many months to a year without extraplastid support seems impossible. Thus, from a functional perspective, four levels of chloroplast retention (described by Evertsen et al., 2007, but with homage paid to Clark et al., 1990) seem appropriate—(1) nonfunctional, the plastids are rapidly digested in the phagosome; (2) photosynthesis for less than a month; (3) photosynthesis for up to 3 months; and (4) photosynthesis for a year or more (Fig. 4.2). Whether or not photosynthesis occurs by the engulfed chloroplasts in the first level is likely merely a function of the process and rate of digestion by the phagosome in the particular species of slug, rather than any sort of biochemical accommodation on the part of the slug cell. The second level suggests the presence of some sort of a biochemically modified, nondigestive phagosome, but the captured plastid gradually uses up the resources brought with it from the algal cell and is degraded by the forces of harvesting light energy, without any input from the host cell. However, the two longer term levels suggest that at least a partial integration of the symbiotic plastid into the cell biology of the host cell has occurred. The chloroplasts ultimately fail even in the longest of the associations, and at least in E. chlorotica, the host cell degrades the plastid in a vacuole that takes on morphological characteristics of an apoptotic heterolysosome (Mondy and Pierce, 2003).Figure 4.2.

Cogdell, in , 2012AbstractPhotosynthesis begins when photons are absorbed by the light-harvesting system. The light-harvesting system then transfers the absorbed energy to the reaction center (RC), where it is trapped and initiates the primary redox reactions of photosynthesis. The light-harvesting system therefore acts to increase the effective cross-sectional area of each RC for light absorption. This means that RCs can be kept supplied with sufficient numbers of photons even when the incident light intensity is rather low. The size of the antenna system and the types of pigments that are used depend on the ecological niche in which the particular photosynthetic species lives.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123749208008080Rowan F. Sage, Tammy L. Sage, in , 2013AbstractC4 photosynthesis compensates for photosynthetic limitations imposed by low atmospheric CO2. C4 plants concentrate CO2 into the bundle sheath (BS) cells where Rubisco is localized. This leads to more efficient photosynthesis in warm climates and thus facilitates domination of open landscapes of low-to-mid latitude. C4 photosynthesis also allows exotic C4 grasses to become aggressive weeds. Where humans facilitate grass establishment, invasive C4 grasses can initiate autocatalytic grass-fire cycles that destroy tropical forests. Although exotic C4 grasses are expanding, much of the Earth's native C4 diversity is being degraded due to overexploitation of their habitat for agricultural purposes.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123847195001921U.M.N. Murthy, M.L. Ghirardi, in , 2013Reduced Antenna SizePhotosynthesis and H2 production in unicellular green algae can in principle operate with a nearly 100% photon utilization efficiency, making them potentially efficient biocatalysts for the generation of H2 from sunlight and water. However, green algal cultures show poor light utilization efficiency under direct sun light and can waste up to 80% of the absorbed irradiance. The reason for this is that green algal photosynthesis normally saturates at about one-fifth of full sunlight intensity or less. This optical property of the cells would further lower the productivity of a commercial hydrogen production. Enhanced hydrogen production may be achieved by engineering the antenna size to suppress fluorescence and heat dissipation that causes a reduction on antenna efficiency.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123786302004461M. Goldschmidt-Clermont, in , 2001PhotosynthesisPhotosynthesis can be described as the process that allows some living organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is used to synthesize organic compounds. Photosynthesis directly supports plants, algae, and some prokaryotes, and also indirectly sustains most of life in the biosphere (setting aside the minor contribution from chemoautotrophic bacteria) by providing organic matter, food, and oxygen.Oxygenic photosynthesis, which will be the main focus of this discussion, is found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria: CO2 is reduced to carbohydrate, water is oxidized, and oxygen is evolved. Overall, the whole process can be summarized as:CO2+H2O+light→CH2O+O2Photosynthesis comprises two phases: in the first set of reactions, light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy, which is then used in the second phase to reduce CO2 to carbohydrate. The chemical energy provided by photosynthesis is also used in other processes such as nitrogen or sulfur assimilation. The first phase takes place in the photosynthetic membrane and involves a series of large complexes, each containing multiple polypeptide subunits and a variety of pigments and cofactors. They form an extraordinarily sophisticated machinery which is both efficient and robust, capable of rapid dynamic adaptation to large changes in light intensity. In the case of oxygenic photosynthesis (Figure 1), photons are captured by the light-harvesting complexes (LHCII and LHCI) and their energy is used to drive redox reactions in the photosystems (PSII and PSI) and hence the flow of electrons along the electron transfer chain, from water to NADP. The cytochrome b6f complex lies in series between PSII and PSI. Water oxidation by PSII releases H+ ions, and electron transfer through the cytochrome b6f complex is coupled to H+ transfer across the photosynthetic membrane. The resulting H+ gradient is used by the ATP synthase complex to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Cyclic electron flow, involving PSI and the cytochrome b6f complex but not PSII, contributes to the H+ gradient and thus to ATP synthesis, but not to the net production of NADPH. In the second phase of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP participate in a series of enzymatic reactions (known as the Calvin cycle) for the reduction of CO2 to carbohydrate. In this phase light plays a regulatory role by activating enzymes of the Calvin cycle through a pathway that involves ferredoxin and thioredoxin. The enzyme Rubisco (ribulose-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) plays a central role in CO2 fixation: it catalyzes the carboxylation of a sugar pentose to yield two molecules of triose. However Rubisco also catalyzes a side-reaction, oxygenation of the pentose which leads to photorespiration and ultimately loss of CO2.Figure 1. Simplified scheme of photosynthetic electron transport in the thylakoid membrane. Light energy captured by the antenna complex LHCII is transferred to the reaction center of photosystem II (PSII), where it induces charge separation. PSII thus catalyzes the light-driven reduction of plastoquinone and oxidation of water, with the release of oxygen and protons (H+) in the lumen. Reduced plastoquinone (PQH2), soluble in the membrane, transfers electrons to the cytochrome b6f complex. The b6f complex oxidizes PQH2 and releases protons in the lumen; one electron is transferred to plastocyanin while the other is used in the Q-cycle and returns to the plastoquinone pool. Plastocyanin (PC), a soluble protein of the lumen, transfers the electrons to photosystem I. Light energy, captured by the antenna complex of photosystem I (LHCI), drives charge separation in photosystem (PSI) so that plastocyanin is oxidized and ferredoxin is reduced. Ferredoxin (Fd) is a soluble protein of the stroma, which is oxidized by the enzyme ferredoxin NADP reductase (FNR) to reduce NADP to NADPH. The proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, generated by photosynthetic electron transport, is used by the ATP synthase complex to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi. In cyclic electron flow, electrons are returned to the b6f complex, favoring the formation of the proton gradient instead of the production of NADPH.The thick black arrows show the path of electrons from water to NADPH. The dotted gray arrow denotes cyclic electron flow.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122270800016803K. Sudhakar, R. Mamat, in , 2019AbstractNatural photosynthesis is considered the most vital processes that endure life on Earth. Artificial photosynthesis is a concept attracting substantial recent interest for alternative energy harvesting and storage strategies. The artificial photosynthesis derives inspiration from nature for the conversion of solar light energy into electrical power. The “artificial leaf” concept aims to capture CO2 directly and convert it into liquid solar fuels or electricity. Engineering the natural photosynthetic process to produce energy represents the major challenge in the pursuit of the creation of an artificial leaf. The various aspects that are discussed in this modules are (1) natural versus artificial photosynthesis, (2) the components of an artificial leaf, (3) the possible approaches in developing an artificial leaf, (4) recent advancements and developments in artificial leaf, (5) the challenges of artificial leaf design. Finally, an outlook is presented on the future research direction of the solar leaf technology.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489117993Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournalReference work • 2009We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

April 28, 2020 By Green plants make sugar for growth by a process called photosynthesis, which means making things with light. Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of glucose. The glucose molecules created by photosynthesis act as fuel for cells and are used for cellular respiration and fermentation. Carbon dioxide + water (and light ) ———> glucose and oxygen Where does photosynthesis happen? Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplast cells which contain a substance called chlorophyll. It is chlorophyll which gives plants their green colour. Chloroplasts are one of the organelles in a plant cell. We made a to learn about organelles and plant cell structure. Sunlight is also needed to make chlorophyll. If plants are kept in the dark, they can’t make chlorophyll and will have yellow leaves! You can see this in our multicoloured . What affects the rate of photosynthesis Four factors affect the rate of photosynthesis. The faster it occurs, the more the plant grows. Light – the more light there is, the faster photosynthesis occurs. Water – lack of water slows photosynthesis down. Temperature – photosynthesis works best at around 30 degrees Celsius. Levels of carbon dioxide – photosynthesis is faster if there is more carbon dioxide in the air. Plants make the energy to grow through a process called . This uses the sugar produced by photosynthesis and oxygen. How are leaves adapted for photosynthesis? Leaves are green as they contain lots of chlorophyll which absorbs sunlight. They are thin and have a large surface area. This means they can absorb a lot of sunlight, and gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass in and out of the leaf easily. Leaves have veins – xylem and phloem, which transport water, minerals and sugars around the plant. Do only plants photosynthesise? No! Plants, algae, and some types of bacteria use photosynthesis to create energy. What is chlorophyll? Chlorophyll is a green pigment which absorbs energy from blue and red light waves and reflects green light waves, which is why plants look green! Chlorophyll is found in an organelle called a chloroplast. This is where photosynthesis occurs. Why is photosynthesis important? As well as allowing plants to make energy for growth and repair, photosynthesis has an important ecological impact. Plants incorporate the carbon from carbon dioxide into organic molecules ( carbon fixation ). This creates a source of carbon for animals who cannot create their own and also removes carbon dioxide from the air, slowing down the rate at which it builds up in the atmosphere. Photosynthesis also creates oxygen which is needed for most of the life on Earth!

Instructor Lucas Clinger Learn the photosynthesis definition and study the photosynthesis process. Explore what happens during photosynthesis and study the photosynthesis equation. Updated: 02/03/2022 Table of Contents Frequently Asked Questions What is the photosynthesis process? The photosynthesis process is a two part process. In stage one, the reactants of water, carbon dioxide and sunlight enter the granum of the chloroplast. Here, the chlorophyll absorbs light energy and converts it into energy that breaks apart the water molecules. In stage two, the process moves into the stroma, and energy is used to break apart carbon dioxide and assemble atoms into glucose, a sugar that is the plant's food. Extra oxygen molecules are released as the plant's waste gas. How does photosynthesis occur in plants? Photosynthesis occurs in plants by the pigment molecule, chlorophyll, absorbing light energy. When the light energy is absorbed, it is converted into energy the plant can use to break carbon dioxide and water down and use those materials to create food for the plant. The food created is glucose, a type of sugar. It also creates oxygen molecules that are released into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar. The by-product, or waste gas of this process is oxygen. The prefix photo comes from the Greek word meaning light. The word synthesis means that something is made by combining things. Thus, the word photosynthesis means ""to put together with the help of light"". Photosynthesis is only able to convert energy from light with the help of the green called that is stored in the of plant cells. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. What Is Photosynthesis?Plants have a power we humans can only dream of - making food from sunlight. Sure, we can cook some savory dishes, but we use food already made, mostly by plants. This process of assembling carbohydrates fueled by the power of sunlight is called photosynthesis. Keep in mind that the sun emits all sorts of different kinds of energy, such as heat and gamma rays, but photosynthesis specifically captures light energy. In addition, photosynthesis generates basic sugar molecules called glucose, which can be used to build more complex carbohydrates. 42K views Several things happen during photosynthesis. It is divided into two stages, but there are several parts in each stage of the photosynthesis process that led up to the plant's creation of food. The two-stage process of photosynthesis takes the reactants water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight into the chloroplasts where the chlorophyll converts the light energy from the sun into energy the plant can use. The plant uses this energy to break the bonds of the water and carbon dioxide molecules, then uses the atoms to build glucose and oxygen molecules. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. Two distinct stages take place in two different areas of a plant cell's chloroplast. The chloroplast is an organelle unique to plant cells. Animal cells do not contain chloroplasts. The chloroplasts hold a pigment molecule called chlorophyll. A pigment molecule is one that has the ability to absorb light and color. This green pigment of chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. In the first stage of photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide enter and move into the chloroplast. Inside the chloroplast are stacks of called the . In the granum is where the photosynthetic pigment called chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The photons from the sun's energy are used to break the bonds of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and some of the oxygen is released from the plant through small openings on the surface of its leaves or stem called stoma. Stage one is called the light dependent stage because the process cannot happen without the absorption of sunlight. In stage two, the process moves into the stroma, an open area around the granum. It is here that the ATP energy from stage one aids in breaking the bonds of carbon dioxide and builds glucose molecules. Stage two is called the light independent stage because the materials used in this stage can complete their activities without the use of light. Detailed Drawing of the Parts of A Chloroplast To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. The process of photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen. Oxygen molecules are released through the plant's stoma, small openings on the underside of the leaves or on the outside of the stem. Glucose is a form of sugar and an energy source. Glucose is a potential chemical energy molecule, meaning it stores chemical energy for later use. In order to use the energy stored in glucose, it must be broken down by the process of cellular respiration. During this process, new products are formed, and energy is released as kinetic chemical energy that the plant, or organism that has eaten the plant, can use.

The role of chlorophyll, the pigment molecule in plant cells, is to absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis. The chlorophyll is contained in plant cell organelles called chloroplasts. It is in the chloroplasts that some of the solar light energy in photosynthesis is transformed into chemical energy stored in a , the food photosynthesis creates for the plant. The task that photosynthesis accomplishes is rearranging the atoms of carbon dioxide and water molecules and assembling them into food molecules. This task can be represented with the photosynthesis equation:6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂The equation shows that carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are the reactants of photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen. The equation also shows that one round of photosynthesis requires six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water to be assembled to create food molecules. The food molecule is glucose. The oxygen molecules are the waste gas of the plant.Plants are not the only organisms that undergo photosynthesis. Some protists, such as algae, and some types of bacteria make their own food through the process of photosynthesis as well. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. The Process of PhotosynthesisThe prefix 'photo' means light, and 'synthesis' means to bring together. In other words, photosynthesis is the bringing together of molecules using light energy. Just what does the process of photosynthesis bring together to make sugar molecules? Two things: carbon dioxide and water. How this process works can be understood from two overarching perspectives: matter and energy. In terms of matter, photosynthesis takes smaller, simpler materials and assembles them into larger, more complex ones. In terms of energy, photosynthesis transforms light energy from the sun into a form living things can access: the stored chemical energy in food molecules. Technically, one round of photosynthesis requires six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water. From this, one molecule of glucose is produced along with six molecules of oxygen as a by-product. carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> oxygen and glucose, or more specifically: 6CO2 + 6H2 O + sunlight -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 The formula for photosynthesis includes water, sunlight and carbon dioxide as reactants, and glucose and oxygen as products Where Does Photosynthesis Occur?The first part of the process of photosynthesis is the light dependent reactions. As mentioned, sunlight is the energy source for this process. In terms of cellular structures, plants and other organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis must have certain specialized components. One component that photosynthetic organisms require is a pigment molecule, which is a special-colored substance that acts like an antenna capable of absorbing light energy. Pigment molecules channel the light energy into the right spot where the cell is carrying out photosynthesis. The most common pigment is chlorophyll, which is responsible for the widespread green color we all associate with plants. Plants contain their chlorophyll and pigments inside a type of organelle called a chloroplast, and it is within this structure that photosynthesis is carried out. Prokaryotic organisms that lack organelles simply carry out the food-making process in the cytoplasm, but still require pigment molecules to do so. Chloroplasts are organelles inside plant cells where photosynthesis is carried out Perhaps you have seen plants with red or yellow leaves, and not just in fall? These plants have other types of pigments in them instead of or in addition to chlorophyll. The Products of PhotosynthesisOne round of photosynthesis produces a single sugar molecule. The most common sugar made is glucose, which has the chemical formula C6 H12 O6. Like all molecules, glucose contains chemical potential energy. Living things can only access the energy needed to survive from food molecules. In other words, plants convert solar energy into a form of energy living things can be fueled by because, clearly, we cannot satisfy our hunger from taking in rays at the beach. Even plants themselves must break down the same food they make to access the energy they need, much like a farmer must eat even though s/he grows acres and acres of crops. In addition to sugar, photosynthesis releases six molecules of oxygen gas (O2). The chemical equation for photosynthesis Photosynthesis in Other OrganismsThere are other organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis aside from plants, such as certain types of bacteria and protists. To be fair to the bacteria, they are likely the ones who evolved the process in the first place. Any organism, plant or otherwise, carrying out photosynthesis would have to contain one of the pigment molecules, usually chlorophyll. Lesson SummaryPhotosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert light energy into sugar molecules. The equation for photosynthesis is: carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> oxygen and glucose 6CO2 + 6H2 O + sunlight -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 Photosynthesis starts with the light dependent reactions, which are the steps that use chlorophyll, a pigment molecule, to extract energy from light. The light dependent reactions power the next set of reactions that create the products of photosynthesis, oxygen and glucose, a single sugar molecule.

0,discoverwildlife,Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis - Molecular Biology of the ...,https://www.discoverwildlife.com/plant-facts/facts-about-photosynthesis/,"Photosynthesis guide, what is it and how does it work? | BBC Wildlife | Discover WildlifeFrom the team at BBC Wildlife MagazineSearchPhotosynthesis: what it is, how it works and why it fuels life on earthPhotosynthesis: what it is, how it works and why it fuels life on earthPhotosynthesis is a biological process where plants and microbes use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to create oxygen and energy.By Published: September 28, 2022 at 5:21 PMIn this expert guide, we look at photosynthesis – the process by which plants and other organisms convert carbon dioxide, water and light into food, creating oxygen along the way. So what exactly is photosynthesis, and how does it work?AdvertisementWhat is photosynthesis?Photosynthesis is one of nature's most important processes. Powered by sunlight, it uses carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce carbohydrates, the food that ultimately fuels most life on Earth.The process also releases a byproduct, oxygen (O2), which has become vital for burning carbs to generate energy through aerobic respiration.Photosynthesis enables an organism to harness solar power to synthesise its own food – carbohydrate molecules – from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Which species can photosynthesise?Besides plants and microbes such as cyanobacteria, photosynthetic organisms also include algae – a diverse group containing everything from single-celled species like Chlorella to multicellular that form kelp forests.Photomicrograph of a freshwater clustering single-celled Chlorella species. © NNehring/GettyIn plant cells, photosynthesis occurs inside chloroplasts – descendants of cyanobacteria that were integrated into plants over 2 billion years ago through endosymbiosis.When and where does photosynthesis take place?Green chloroplasts, carrying chlorophyll, in plant cells of anacharis or waterweed, Egeria densa. © NNehring/GettyWhile you might think it only happens during daytime, the process actually has two stages: light reactions that capture solar energy (the 'photo' half of the word) and dark reactions that can occur day or night to make food ('synthesis').Dark reactions take place in a microbe or chloroplast's internal fluid, whereas light reactions occur in membranes called thylakoids that are folded to maximise the surface area exposed to sunlight. Leaves are often large, flat structures to catch light, but other green parts of a plant (like stems) also photosynthesise.You may also like: Why do leaves have pores?Stomata and guard cells in the leaf epidermis of a spiderwort. © Ed Reschke/GettyLeaf pores are a double-edged sword: the openings allow a plant to suck-up the carbon dioxide it needs to make food, but they also let precious water escape. While early plants had to cope with losing water passively through pores that were just holes, modern species have structures called stomata that actively adjust an aperture's size in response to physiological or environmental cues. Stomata therefore help a plant to minimise water loss, balanced with gaining carbon for photosynthesis.More like thisDo aquatic plants have stomata?The gas exchange that occurs via stomata for land plants is different for aquatic plants. If an aquatic plant were covered in tiny holes, it would drown. So in water lilies and other flowering plants with floating leaves, only the upper side of a leaf has stomata – and those pores are permanently open because aquatic plants don't really need to worry about losing moisture. It seems to work well, as floating plants have emerged at least 13 times independently by convergent evolution.Some flowering plants are even adapted to a submerged lifestyle: seagrasses lack stomata completely and carry out photosynthesis, but they must rely on bacteria in shallow ocean sediments to provide a source of carbon in the absence of CO2.How do organisms capture light?The cells of photosynthetic organisms convert light to chemical energy through photosystems – a combination of pigments, enzymes and other molecules. The core component of a photosystem is the green pigment chlorophyll.After being hit by photons (particles that make up light), electrons in chlorophyll absorb enough energy to break free, which starts a chain reaction in which energised electrons are passed between intermediates to generate the molecules ATP and NADPH, whose chemical bonds carry the energy that's later released to make food. In plants, chlorophyll's lost electrons are replaced by splitting water, releasing oxygen.Is chlorophyll the only pigment?Red coralline algae in Point Fermin Park in San Pedro, CA. © Pam Susemiehl/GettyNo, but it's the best at absorbing sunlight near the blue end of the visible spectrum, where photons have greater energy. Many organisms, especially aquatic species, also have accessory pigments such as phycobilin that are more efficient at harnessing photon energies toward the red end of the spectrum, allowing those wavelengths to be absorbed if water has filtered-out blue light. The distinctive colour of red algae is explained by the presence of large amounts of phycobilin.So how is food made from carbon dioxide?Like making drinks in a slushie machine that continually rotates and is refilled with flavouring and ice, photosynthetic cells produce carbohydrates by recycling them and replenishing the supply of carbon by regularly adding carbon dioxide (and usually water). That involves a circular series of reactions popularly called the Calvin cycle, which is driven by the energy-carrying molecules ATP and NADPH.The first step in that cycle involves carbon fixation: adding or 'fixing' carbon dioxide (a volatile gas) to a stable compound, a reaction catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCO. Because it constitutes an estimated 3 per cent of the total mass in leaves, and most of Earth's biomass is plant matter, RuBisCO is arguably the most abundant protein on the planet. And because the enzyme's activity ends-up producing more than 90 per cent of organic carbon, RuBisCO is one of nature's most important proteins.Do any animals photosynthesise?The tiny polyps of form a symbiotic relationship with algae, providing a home and the nutrients required for photosynthesis and benefiting from food generated by the algae.Some sea slugs are able retain the chloroplasts after grazing on algae, and these are engulfed by their own cells. They also assimilate some of the algal genes, enabling them to produce cholorophyll. The slugs have been recorded using the pilfered structures to sustain themselves for up to ten months, earning them the nickname ‘solar-powered sea slugs’.Spotted salamander. © Julie DeRoche/Design Pics/GettySo far, only one vertebrate is known to have a comparable association with algae – the spotted salamander (pictured above), a very striking amphibian found in the eastern United States and Canada. Soon after being laid, the salamander’s eggs are colonised by water-dwelling algae, which turn the gelatinous spheres green. The algae appear to thrive on wast, such as ammonia produced by the developing salamander embryos, and in turn provide oxygen and carbon. This enables the embryos to develop faster, increasing their survival rates. The algae more or less disappear by the time the larvae hatch, so the partnership appears temporary.This Q&A originally appeared in BBC Wildlife, and was answered by Laurie Jackson.AdvertisementMain image: Large green hosta leaves. © Maryna Terletska/GettyAuthorsScience communicatorJV Chamary is an award-winning journalist with a PhD in evolutionary biology.

It occurs in the chloroplasts (most of which are in the leaves) and there are two principal types of reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, which require the presence of light, energy from sunlight is absorbed by photosynthetic pigments (chiefly the green pigment chlorophyll) and used to bring about the photolysis of water:H2O → 2H++2e−+½O2. The electrons released by this reaction pass along a series of electron carriers (see electron transport chain); as they do so they lose their energy, which is used to convert ADP to ATP in the process of photophosphorylation. The electrons and protons produced by the photolysis of water are used to reduce NADP:2H++2e−+NADP+ → NADPH+H+. The ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent reactions provide energy and reducing power, respectively, for the ensuing light-independent reactions (formerly called the ‘dark reaction’), which nevertheless cannot be sustained without the ATP generated by the light-dependent reactions. During these reactions carbon dioxide is reduced to carbohydrate in a metabolic pathway known as the Calvin cycle. Photosynthesis can be summarized by the equation:CO2+2H2O → [CH2O]+H2O+O2. Since virtually all other forms of life are directly or indirectly dependent on plants for food, photosynthesis is the basis for all life on earth. Furthermore virtually all the atmospheric oxygen has originated from oxygen released during photosynthesis.H2O → 2H++2e−+½O2.2H++2e−+NADP+ → NADPH+H+CO2+2H2O → [CH2O]+H2O+O2Photosynthesis From: in Subjects: — Related content in Oxford Reference Reference entries in Concise Medical Dictionary (8) Length: 53 words in A Dictionary of Food and Nutrition (3) Length: 19 words in Oxford Dictionary of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (2) Length: 375 words in A Dictionary of Biology (6) Length: 266 words Copyright © 2023.

Photosynthesis is the process that plants go through to make food by using sunlight and chlorophyll to turn water and carbon dioxide into nutrients. Teaching your children about photosynthesis at KS2? Take a look at this handy . How do plants make food? Ever wonder why you don't see plants rocking up in restaurants ordering a steak? That's because they don't eat food in the same way that we do. Instead, plants have food by a process called photosynthesis. (No, it doesn't actually have anything to do with photography.) Photosynthesis is the process that plants go through when using sunlight and chlorophyll to turn water and carbon dioxide into nutrients. The word Photosynthesis comes from the words Photo: Light Synthesis: Putting together What Is The Process Of Photosynthesis? Photosynthesis has four main steps: 1. Absorption of Light from the sun through the plant's chlorophyll 2. The light energy is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen 3. Oxygen is released into the atmosphere 4. Hydrogen from the water and carbon dioxide from the air are used as food. This all happens in the leaves of plants that contain very small cells. In these cells, there are small structures called , and inside these is where you'll find the chlorophyll. This is what makes plants look green. So if you've ever had any of your students or children asking the question, 'How do plants make food?', then photosynthesis is your answer! What Does Photosynthesis Produce? Photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen. Both are necessary for human survival. Glucose is found in fruits and vegetables, and oxygen is required for respiration. Both glucose and oxygen are vital sources of food for the plant itself, therefore this is how plants make their own food. Why Is Photosynthesis Important? Photosynthesis is important because it produces Oxygen, this is needed for all living things to survive.Photosynthesis also balances the levels of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere. The relationship between humans and plants is symbiotic. This means that we have a close relationship where we both benefit. Humans breathe in the oxygen that plants produce, and breath out carbon dioxide. Plants 'breathe in' carbon dioxide that humans produce and 'breathe out' oxygen. Without one or the other, both would eventually die out (yikes). The glucose that plants produce is sometimes stored in fruits and roots - this is why we can eat apples, and oranges, and other plant-based foods.

The process of photosynthesis occurs in two steps. In the first step, energy from light is stored in the bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). These two energy-storing cofactors are then used in the second step of photosynthesis to produce organic molecules by combining carbon molecules derived from carbon dioxide (CO2). The second step of photosynthesis is known as the Calvin Cycle. These organic molecules can then be used by mitochondria to produce ATP, or they can be combined to form glucose, sucrose, and other carbohydrates. The chemical equation for the entire process can be seen below. Photosynthesis Equation 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light -> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O Above is the overall reaction for photosynthesis. Using the energy from light and the hydrogens and electrons from water, the plant combines the carbons found in carbon dioxide into more complex molecules. While a 3-carbon molecule is the direct result of photosynthesis, glucose is simply two of these molecules combined and is often represented as the direct result of photosynthesis due to glucose being a foundational molecule in many cellular systems. You will also notice that 6 gaseous oxygen molecules are produced, as a by-produce. The plant can use this oxygen in its mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. While some of the oxygen is used for this purpose, a large portion is expelled into the atmosphere and allows us to breathe and undergo our own oxidative phosphorylation, on sugar molecules derived from plants. You will also notice that this equation shows water on both sides. That is because 12 water molecules are split during the light reactions, while 6 new molecules are produced during and after the Calvin cycle. While this is the general equation for the entire process, there are many individual reactions which contribute to this pathway. Stages of Photosynthesis The Light Reactions The light reactions happen in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts of plant cells. The thylakoids have densely packed protein and enzyme clusters known as photosystems. There are two of these systems, which work in conjunction with each other to remove electrons and hydrogens from water and transfer them to the cofactors ADP and NADP+. These photosystems were named in the order of which they were discovered, which is opposite of how electrons flow through them. As seen in the image below, electrons excited by light energy flow first through photosystem II (PSII), and then through photosystem I (PSI) as they create NADPH. ATP is created by the protein ATP synthase, which uses the build-up of hydrogen atoms to drive the addition of phosphate groups to ADP. The entire system works as follows. A photosystem is comprised of various proteins that surround and connect a series of pigment molecules. Pigments are molecules that absorb various photons, allowing their electrons to become excited. Chlorophyll a is the main pigment used in these systems, and collects the final energy transfer before releasing an electron. Photosystem II starts this process of electrons by using the light energy to split a water molecule, which releases the hydrogen while siphoning off the electrons. The electrons are then passed through plastoquinone, an enzyme complex that releases more hydrogens into the thylakoid space. The electrons then flow through a cytochrome complex and plastocyanin to reach photosystem I. These three complexes form an electron transport chain, much like the one seen in mitochondria. Photosystem I then uses these electrons to drive the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The additional ATP made during the light reactions comes from ATP synthase, which uses the large gradient of hydrogen molecules to drive the formation of ATP. The Calvin Cycle With its electron carriers NADPH and ATP all loaded up with electrons, the plant is now ready to create storable energy. This happens during the Calvin Cycle, which is very similar to the citric acid cycle seen in mitochondria. However, the citric acid cycle creates ATP other electron carriers from 3-carbon molecules, while the Calvin cycle produces these products with the use of NADPH and ATP. The cycle has 3 phases, as seen in the graphic below. During the first phase, a carbon is added to a 5-carbon sugar, creating an unstable 6-carbon sugar. In phase two, this sugar is reduced into two stable 3-carbon sugar molecules. Some of these molecules can be used in other metabolic pathways, and are exported. The rest remain to continue cycling through the Calvin cycle. During the third phase, the five-carbon sugar is regenerated to start the process over again. The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma of a chloroplast. While not considered part of the Calvin cycle, these products can be used to create a variety of sugars and structural molecules. Products of Photosynthesis The direct products of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle are 3-phosphoglycerate and G3P, two different forms of a 3-carbon sugar molecule. Two of these molecules combined equals one glucose molecule, the product seen in the photosynthesis equation. While this is the main food source for plants and animals, these 3-carbon skeletons can be combined into many different forms. A structural form worth note is cellulose, and extremely strong fibrous material made essentially of strings of glucose. Besides sugars and sugar-based molecules, oxygen is the other main product of photosynthesis. Oxygen created from photosynthesis fuels every respiring organism on the planet. Quiz 1. To complete the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is needed. Carbon dioxide reaches the interior of the plant via stomata, or small holes in the surface of a leaf. To avoid water loss and total dehydration on hot days, plants close their stomata. Can plants continue to undergo photosynthesis? A. Yes, as long as there is light B. No, without CO2 the process cannot continue C. Only the light reaction will continue Answer to Question #1B is correct. Without the ability to exchange oxygen with carbon dioxide, the plant’s Calvin cycle will shut down. The protein responsible for fixing carbon dioxide will start to bond with oxygen instead. Without a place for the ATP and NADPH, those concentrations will become oversaturated and may start to decrease the pH in the cell. Plants have evolved many responses to this, such as photorespiration, the C4 pathway, and the CAM pathway. 2. Why are the products of photosynthesis important to non-photosynthetic organisms? A. It is the basis of most the energy on Earth B. They need the minor nutrients assembled by plants C. They are not important for obligate carnivores Answer to Question #2A is correct. In the study of ecological food webs, organisms with the ability to photosynthesize are known as primary producers. Even obligate carnivores, or animals that eat only meat, are deriving their energy from the sun. Besides strange sulfur bacteria and other minor groups of primary producers, the majority of the stored chemical energy that animals rely on comes directly from photosynthesis. 3. Why do plants need water? A. For photosynthesis B. For structure C. To transfer nutrients D. All of the above Answer to Question #3D is correct. Plants use water for all of the above purposes. The constant flow of water from the roots to the leaves transfers essential nutrients. Water molecules are then split, and the various components are used to generate chemical energy. Further, as water pushes into the cells, the cell walls push together to give the plant support and structure. References Lodish, H., Berk, A., Kaiser, C. A., Krieger, M., Scott, M.

From the vibrant greens of the forests to the delicate blossoms in your garden, we will embark on a journey through the hidden world of plants and witness the magic of photosynthesis firsthand.Image source: FreepikKey HighlightsPhotosynthesis is the process through which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (sugar) and oxygen.Chlorophyll, the pigment responsible for the green color in plants, plays a vital role in capturing sunlight.The captured sunlight energizes the plant's cells and triggers a series of chemical reactions.Water absorbed by the roots is transported to the leaves, where it undergoes a splitting process to release oxygen.Imagine a world without lush green forests, vibrant flowers, or even the oxygen we breathe. Fortunately, thanks to the remarkable process of photosynthesis, plants have the incredible ability to create their own food using sunlight and air. As we delve into the enchanting world of plants, let us unlock the secrets behind their life-sustaining process.Sunlight: The spark of lifeAt the heart of photosynthesis lies the magnificent power of sunlight. Plants are equipped with a special pigment called chlorophyll, which gives them their characteristic green hue. Chlorophyll acts like a tiny solar panel, capturing sunlight and converting it into energy. Just like us, plants need energy to survive and carry out their daily activities.Water: The essential elixirWhile sunlight provides the spark, water is the vital elixir that keeps the photosynthesis process flowing. Through their roots, plants absorb water from the soil and transport it to their leaves. Here, water molecules are split into hydrogen and oxygen atoms in a process called photolysis. This splitting releases oxygen into the air, replenishing our planet's atmosphere.Carbon dioxide: The invisible ingredientIn addition to sunlight and water, plants require carbon dioxide—an invisible component of the air we breathe. They obtain carbon dioxide through tiny openings called stomata on their leaves. Inside the leaves, carbon dioxide combines with the hydrogen released during photolysis to form glucose—the ultimate plant fuel.Glucose: The nectar of lifeGlucose, also known as sugar, is the ultimate reward of photosynthesis. It serves as a vital source of energy for plants, allowing them to grow, develop, and carry out essential metabolic functions. Some of the glucose is used immediately by the plant, while the rest is stored for future use as starch or converted into other important compounds.Oxygen: A breath of fresh airAs plants harness sunlight and create glucose, they also produce a life-giving byproduct—oxygen. This oxygen is released into the atmosphere, replenishing the air we breathe and supporting the existence of countless organisms, including us humans. In this symbiotic relationship, plants and animals depend on each other for survival.ConclusionThrough the magical process of photosynthesis, plants paint the world with their vibrant colors, provide a breath of fresh air, and nourish the entire ecosystem. From the towering trees of the rainforests to the delicate petals of a rose, every plant on this planet is a testament to the incredible power of photosynthesis.Next time you stroll through a garden or find yourself surrounded by nature's beauty, take a moment to appreciate the astonishing journey that plants embark on every day. They silently work their magic, converting sunlight and air into the very sustenance they need to flourish. Photosynthesis is not just a scientific process; it is a captivating story of survival, adaptation, and interconnectedness.So, let us cherish and protect our green companions, for they are the life-givers, the providers of oxygen, and the guardians of our planet's delicate balance. The next time you witness a blooming flower or bask in the shade of a majestic tree, remember the wondrous tale of photosynthesis, where sunlight and air become the very essence of life itself.Photosynthesis FAQsWhat is photosynthesis?Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. It is the primary way in which plants create their own food and release oxygen into the atmosphere.How does photosynthesis work?Photosynthesis occurs in specialized structures called chloroplasts, primarily found in plant leaves. Chlorophyll, a pigment within the chloroplasts, absorbs sunlight and converts it into chemical energy. This energy is used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The carbon dioxide taken in from the air is then combined with hydrogen from the water to produce glucose.Why is sunlight important for photosynthesis?Sunlight provides the energy needed to drive the photosynthesis process. The chlorophyll in plants captures sunlight and converts it into chemical energy, which is used to power the various reactions that occur during photosynthesis.What role does water play in photosynthesis?Water is a crucial component of photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is all around us. It's happening under our feet, above our heads and in the sunlit zones of aquatic environments. But what exactly is photosynthesis? Why is it so important? And, when did it evolve? Answers to these questions, and more, are below. For those who missed it, check out these or find out What is photosynthesis? Photosynthesis is the process by which carbohydrate molecules are synthesised. It's used by plants, algae and certain to turn sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and energy, in the form of sugar. It’s probably the most important biochemical process on the planet. Essentially, it takes the carbon dioxide expelled by all breathing organisms and reintroduces it into the atmosphere as oxygen. The rate of photosynthesis is affected by light intensity, the concentration of carbon dioxide, water supply, temperature and availability of minerals. The process takes place entirely in the chloroplasts, and it's the chlorophyll within the chloroplasts that make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green. Photosynthesis is important too, elsewhere in the biosphere. Both marine and terrestrial plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and some of this is precipitated back out, as shells made of calcium carbonate, or buried as organic matter in soil. Without photosynthesis, could not occur, and we would soon run out of food. Over time, the atmosphere would lose almost all gaseous oxygen, and most organisms would disappear. How does photosynthesis work? Plants require light energy, carbon dioxide, water and nutrients. These ingredients come from both the adjacent atmosphere and the soil. Phase 1 Plants absorb sunlight through the two top layers of their leaves, the cuticle and epidermis. These layers are thin, so light can travel through them easily. Carbon dioxide is brought in from the atmosphere, and at the same time, water is drawn up from the soil, into the body of the living plant. Phase 2 Just beneath the cuticle and epidermis are the palisade mesophyll cells. These specialised cells are vertically elongated and arranged closely together to maximise light absorption. Below the palisade mesophyll cells is the spongy mesophyll tissue, which is loosely packed for efficient gas exchange. As gases move in and out of these cells, they dissolve in a thin layer of water that covers the cells.Chloroplasts within the cells of the aquatic waterweed plant, elodea. © Getty images Phase 3 Inside the palisade mesophyll cells are the chloroplasts, . They contain chlorophyll, molecules that don’t absorb green wavelengths of white light. Instead, they reflect it back to us, giving plants their green colour. Phase 4 Inside the chloroplast is where the magic happens. A light-dependent reaction takes place, where energy from the light waves is absorbed and stored in energy-carrying ATP molecules. Then, in a light-independent reaction (the Calvin Cycle), ATP is used to make glucose, a source of energy. Water is oxidised, carbon dioxide is reduced, and oxygen is released into the atmosphere. Oxygen is released via stomata in the leaves, microscopic pores that open to both let in the carbon dioxide, and release oxygen (and water vapour). What is the equation for photosynthesis? Photosynthesising organisms form the base of the food chain. Carbon dioxide + water (with light energy) = glucose + oxygen As well as the light energy, carbon dioxide and water, plants also need nutrients, which they get from the soil. These nutrients are released again, or recycled, when the plant tissue dies and begins decomposing in the soil. Oxygen in the form of gas molecules (O2) is actually a by-product of photosynthesis, but it's responsible for the oxygen in the air that keeps us alive. Plants also release energy and water to the atmosphere through respiration. 6CO2+ 6H2O → C6H12O6+ 6O2 The balanced equation takes it a little further. Six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules (the reactants) are converted into one sugar molecule (C6H12O6) and six oxygen molecules, via the light energy captured by the chlorophyll. Photosynthesis and the food chain During photosynthesis, energy passes through the system, and you can think of photosynthesis as an energy flow system, tracing the path of solar energy through the ecosystem. This energy is stored by the primary producers, the photosynthesising organisms. As these organisms are eaten and digested by the primary consumers, chemical energy is released and this is used to power new biochemical reactions. At each level of energy transformation throughout the food chain, some energy is lost as waste heat. In addition, a significant amount of the energy input to each organism is used in respiration, to maintain the body of that organism. This energy is not stored for use by other organisms higher up the food chain. This is one of the reasons why both the number of organisms and their total quantity of living tissue decrease as you go further up the food chain. When did photosynthesis start? The of photosynthesis had immense consequences for the Earth. As organic matter from photosynthetic life was buried in the strata, carbon was removed from the atmosphere allowing oxygen to accumulate. Evidence suggests that , in the form of stromatolites. Stromatolites are laminated microbial structures (), usually formed by cyanobacteria and algae, and are the oldest known fossils, and therefore the earliest evidence of life on Earth.Stromatolites are layered, calcareous mounds secreted from cyanobacteria and trapped sediment. They are the oldest known fossils and the earliest evidence of life on Earth. They are still being formed today, and these ones are from Lake Thetis, Western Australia © Getty Images As this early oxygen diffused into the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere), solar radiation transformed the oxygen molecules into ozone, which created the stratospheric ozone layer. And of course, as the ozone layer absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet radiation (UV-B), it plays an important role in protecting human health, so it's unlikely that life would have flourished without this protective shield.

Using just three simple ingredients (carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight) plants and bacteria are able to make their own food. Early forms of algae and bacteria were the first organisms to photosynthesize. Scientists estimate that it takes approximately 2,000 years of photosynthetic activity to ""turn over"" or replenish all the oxygen in the earth's biosphere. Fortunately for all animals, including humans and fish, oxygen is a by-product of this process. As long as photosynthesis is occurring, oxygen is continuously being released into the air and into the world's lakes, oceans, rivers, and ponds. Photosynthesis by algae, bacteria, and plants provides the air that humans breathe. The Basics of Photosynthesis Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would not be possible In most plants, photosynthesis occurs in special cells known as chloroplasts. The green hue we see in plants is the result of tiny grains of green pigment (light-absorbing molecules) inside the chloroplasts. These pigments are commonly known as chlorophyll (chloro=green; phyll=leaf). Different types of plants use different forms of chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a is the pigment directly responsible for transforming light energy (sunlight) into chemical energy (carbohydrates). Many plants also contain chlorophyll b and chlorophyll c, pigments which help carry out other chemical processes. Aquatic Plants and Photosynthesis Plants, including aquatic plants, produce oxygen, and they also use oxygen. Here's how these processes work: During a sunny day, dissolved oxygen in water is generally plentiful because photosynthesizing algae and aquatic plants are constantly releasing it into the water. Even though many other organisms are using the oxygen, there is an oxygen surplus. After sundown, without sunlight, photosynthesis slows considerably, or even stops. So, in addition to the usual oxygen demands (from fish, macro-invertebrates, tadpoles, etc.), algae and plants are also pulling oxygen from the water. Too many plants or animals using the oxygen in the system can deplete it and create the potential for a , especially after several days of cloudy weather or low light when less photosynthesis takes place. Factors that Influence the Rate of Photosynthesis and Oxygen Production in Aquatic Plants Water Color Dissolved substances in the water, such as naturally-occurring tea-colored tannins, can prevent sunlight from penetrating down into the water column. This is one reason that many red-water or black-water lakes have few submersed plants. There isn't enough light to allow photosynthesis below a certain depth. These lakes can support emersed or floating-leaved plants which are in direct contact with the sunlight. Turbidity An abundance of suspended clay, silt, or phytoplankton (free-floating algae) can also make a lake turbid or murky, which may slow or prevent submersed plant photosynthesis and growth because of low-light conditions. Florida's Lake Apopka is a good example of the cycle that can occur in a turbid lake. Because of an abundance of algae and suspended sediments in the water that block, scatter or absorb sunlight, submersed plant communities have not been able to re-establish. Without sufficient soil-anchoring plants on the bottom, sediments continue to be re-suspended by wind and wave action, furthering the turbidity problem. Cloudy Weather Several days of cloudy weather can slow the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in lower oxygen production within a waterbody. If you have a small fish pond with an aerator, turn it on during cloudy weather. To learn more, read . Day Length Fewer daylight hours (during autumn and winter) also influence photosynthesis, as well as temperature and humidity. Leaf Characteristics Changes in the condition of a leaf (aging, tearing, etc.), the arrangement of leaves on a branch, even the shape and size of a leaf affects the amount of photosynthesis that occurs in a plant; so much so that two different types of plants have developed over time, based on their tolerance for light. ""Sun plants"" experience an increased rate of photosynthesis as light intensity increases. Leaves on a ""sun plant"" tend to be smaller and thicker, with more pronounced lobes than shade plant leaves. Special cells in these leaves allow higher rates of photosynthesis. ""Shade plants"" photosynthesize at a lower rate, even if a lot of light is available. Their leaves tend to be thinner and longer, with fewer chlorophyll cells, making it easier to photosynthesize under low light conditions. Differences in Photosynthetic Processes While photosynthesis is similar in both aquatic and terrestrial plants, there are a few important differences. For example, emersed plants, floating-leaved plants, and terrestrial plants extract carbon dioxide from the air, while submersed plants extract it from the water. Also, submersed plants have a harder time obtaining carbon dioxide (C02) from the aquatic environment because it has a lower exchange rate of gases. (The diffusion of gases in water is 104 times slower than in air.) To compensate, some plants have leaves that grow above the water, allowing them to also extract C02 from the air. Some aquatic plants such as can live in low light conditions. This means they can grow in deeper water and colonize much earlier in the growing season than other plants. Hydrilla can also become established in lakes with high turbidity when others cannot. No wonder hydrilla has become the most invasive aquatic plant in Florida. Light Attenuation and Photosynthesis Plants use the same visible light spectrum as humans (wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers). However, submersed aquatic plants have a harder time getting the light they need for photosynthesis; suspended particles, dissolved substances and water depth restrict the amount of light that penetrates the water. There are at least two ways to estimate light reduction (or attenuation) in water depth. Secchi disk: The easiest and cheapest method to measure light reduction involves the use of a Secchi disk. The black-and-white disk is lowered into the water and where it becomes invisible is the Secchi depth or Secchi transparency. Once this measurement is obtained, you can multiply it by two to obtain a light attenuation estimate. For example, if a Secchi depth reading for your lake is 5 feet, then multiply it by 2 to get a light attenuation estimate of 10 feet. 2 x 5-foot Secchi depth = 10 feet of light attenuation This means that if your lake is 8 feet deep and the Secchi depth is 5 feet, light is probably reaching the bottom of the lake, and submersed plants can be expected to grow on the bottom. However, if the Secchi disk reading is only 3 feet and the lake depth is 8 feet, light is probably not penetrating to the bottom (2 x 3-foot Secchi depth = 6 feet of light attenuation). In this case, submersed plants are probably not going to grow on the bottom. Most people think of a Secchi disk as a tool for measuring water clarity. However, it can also be used to predict the abundance and type of submersed plants we would expect to find growing in a specific waterbody. Electronic light meter: The second method for measuring light attenuation involves an electronic light meter. A reading is taken immediately below the surface and also at different depths. The readings are used in the following formula to calculate light attenuation: Iz = I0 e-kz Where Iz is the intensity of light at depthI0 is the intensity of light immediately below the surface of the watere is the natural logarithmk is the vertical attenuation (reduction) co-efficient for the downward penetration of light (or ""irradiance"").

The process of photosynthesis occurs in two steps. In the first step, energy from light is stored in the bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH). These two energy-storing cofactors are then used in the second step of photosynthesis to produce organic molecules by combining carbon molecules derived from carbon dioxide (CO2). The second step of photosynthesis is known as the Calvin Cycle. These organic molecules can then be used by mitochondria to produce ATP, or they can be combined to form glucose, sucrose, and other carbohydrates. The chemical equation for the entire process can be seen below. Photosynthesis Equation 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light -> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O Above is the overall reaction for photosynthesis. Using the energy from light and the hydrogens and electrons from water, the plant combines the carbons found in carbon dioxide into more complex molecules. While a 3-carbon molecule is the direct result of photosynthesis, glucose is simply two of these molecules combined and is often represented as the direct result of photosynthesis due to glucose being a foundational molecule in many cellular systems. You will also notice that 6 gaseous oxygen molecules are produced, as a by-produce. The plant can use this oxygen in its mitochondria during oxidative phosphorylation. While some of the oxygen is used for this purpose, a large portion is expelled into the atmosphere and allows us to breathe and undergo our own oxidative phosphorylation, on sugar molecules derived from plants. You will also notice that this equation shows water on both sides. That is because 12 water molecules are split during the light reactions, while 6 new molecules are produced during and after the Calvin cycle. While this is the general equation for the entire process, there are many individual reactions which contribute to this pathway. Stages of Photosynthesis The Light Reactions The light reactions happen in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts of plant cells. The thylakoids have densely packed protein and enzyme clusters known as photosystems. There are two of these systems, which work in conjunction with each other to remove electrons and hydrogens from water and transfer them to the cofactors ADP and NADP+. These photosystems were named in the order of which they were discovered, which is opposite of how electrons flow through them. As seen in the image below, electrons excited by light energy flow first through photosystem II (PSII), and then through photosystem I (PSI) as they create NADPH. ATP is created by the protein ATP synthase, which uses the build-up of hydrogen atoms to drive the addition of phosphate groups to ADP. The entire system works as follows. A photosystem is comprised of various proteins that surround and connect a series of pigment molecules. Pigments are molecules that absorb various photons, allowing their electrons to become excited. Chlorophyll a is the main pigment used in these systems, and collects the final energy transfer before releasing an electron. Photosystem II starts this process of electrons by using the light energy to split a water molecule, which releases the hydrogen while siphoning off the electrons. The electrons are then passed through plastoquinone, an enzyme complex that releases more hydrogens into the thylakoid space. The electrons then flow through a cytochrome complex and plastocyanin to reach photosystem I. These three complexes form an electron transport chain, much like the one seen in mitochondria. Photosystem I then uses these electrons to drive the reduction of NADP+ to NADPH. The additional ATP made during the light reactions comes from ATP synthase, which uses the large gradient of hydrogen molecules to drive the formation of ATP. The Calvin Cycle With its electron carriers NADPH and ATP all loaded up with electrons, the plant is now ready to create storable energy. This happens during the Calvin Cycle, which is very similar to the citric acid cycle seen in mitochondria. However, the citric acid cycle creates ATP other electron carriers from 3-carbon molecules, while the Calvin cycle produces these products with the use of NADPH and ATP. The cycle has 3 phases, as seen in the graphic below. During the first phase, a carbon is added to a 5-carbon sugar, creating an unstable 6-carbon sugar. In phase two, this sugar is reduced into two stable 3-carbon sugar molecules. Some of these molecules can be used in other metabolic pathways, and are exported. The rest remain to continue cycling through the Calvin cycle. During the third phase, the five-carbon sugar is regenerated to start the process over again. The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma of a chloroplast. While not considered part of the Calvin cycle, these products can be used to create a variety of sugars and structural molecules. Products of Photosynthesis The direct products of the light reactions and the Calvin cycle are 3-phosphoglycerate and G3P, two different forms of a 3-carbon sugar molecule. Two of these molecules combined equals one glucose molecule, the product seen in the photosynthesis equation. While this is the main food source for plants and animals, these 3-carbon skeletons can be combined into many different forms. A structural form worth note is cellulose, and extremely strong fibrous material made essentially of strings of glucose. Besides sugars and sugar-based molecules, oxygen is the other main product of photosynthesis. Oxygen created from photosynthesis fuels every respiring organism on the planet. Quiz 1. To complete the Calvin cycle, carbon dioxide is needed. Carbon dioxide reaches the interior of the plant via stomata, or small holes in the surface of a leaf. To avoid water loss and total dehydration on hot days, plants close their stomata. Can plants continue to undergo photosynthesis? A. Yes, as long as there is light B. No, without CO2 the process cannot continue C. Only the light reaction will continue Answer to Question #1B is correct. Without the ability to exchange oxygen with carbon dioxide, the plant’s Calvin cycle will shut down. The protein responsible for fixing carbon dioxide will start to bond with oxygen instead. Without a place for the ATP and NADPH, those concentrations will become oversaturated and may start to decrease the pH in the cell. Plants have evolved many responses to this, such as photorespiration, the C4 pathway, and the CAM pathway. 2. Why are the products of photosynthesis important to non-photosynthetic organisms? A. It is the basis of most the energy on Earth B. They need the minor nutrients assembled by plants C. They are not important for obligate carnivores Answer to Question #2A is correct. In the study of ecological food webs, organisms with the ability to photosynthesize are known as primary producers. Even obligate carnivores, or animals that eat only meat, are deriving their energy from the sun. Besides strange sulfur bacteria and other minor groups of primary producers, the majority of the stored chemical energy that animals rely on comes directly from photosynthesis. 3. Why do plants need water? A. For photosynthesis B. For structure C. To transfer nutrients D. All of the above Answer to Question #3D is correct. Plants use water for all of the above purposes. The constant flow of water from the roots to the leaves transfers essential nutrients. Water molecules are then split, and the various components are used to generate chemical energy. Further, as water pushes into the cells, the cell walls push together to give the plant support and structure. References Lodish, H., Berk, A., Kaiser, C. A., Krieger, M., Scott, M.

0,discoverwildlife,Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis - Molecular Biology of the ...,https://www.discoverwildlife.com/plant-facts/facts-about-photosynthesis/,"Photosynthesis guide, what is it and how does it work? | BBC Wildlife | Discover WildlifeFrom the team at BBC Wildlife MagazineSearchPhotosynthesis: what it is, how it works and why it fuels life on earthPhotosynthesis: what it is, how it works and why it fuels life on earthPhotosynthesis is a biological process where plants and microbes use carbon dioxide, water and sunlight to create oxygen and energy.By Published: September 28, 2022 at 5:21 PMIn this expert guide, we look at photosynthesis – the process by which plants and other organisms convert carbon dioxide, water and light into food, creating oxygen along the way. So what exactly is photosynthesis, and how does it work?AdvertisementWhat is photosynthesis?Photosynthesis is one of nature's most important processes. Powered by sunlight, it uses carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce carbohydrates, the food that ultimately fuels most life on Earth.The process also releases a byproduct, oxygen (O2), which has become vital for burning carbs to generate energy through aerobic respiration.Photosynthesis enables an organism to harness solar power to synthesise its own food – carbohydrate molecules – from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Which species can photosynthesise?Besides plants and microbes such as cyanobacteria, photosynthetic organisms also include algae – a diverse group containing everything from single-celled species like Chlorella to multicellular that form kelp forests.Photomicrograph of a freshwater clustering single-celled Chlorella species. © NNehring/GettyIn plant cells, photosynthesis occurs inside chloroplasts – descendants of cyanobacteria that were integrated into plants over 2 billion years ago through endosymbiosis.When and where does photosynthesis take place?Green chloroplasts, carrying chlorophyll, in plant cells of anacharis or waterweed, Egeria densa. © NNehring/GettyWhile you might think it only happens during daytime, the process actually has two stages: light reactions that capture solar energy (the 'photo' half of the word) and dark reactions that can occur day or night to make food ('synthesis').Dark reactions take place in a microbe or chloroplast's internal fluid, whereas light reactions occur in membranes called thylakoids that are folded to maximise the surface area exposed to sunlight. Leaves are often large, flat structures to catch light, but other green parts of a plant (like stems) also photosynthesise.You may also like: Why do leaves have pores?Stomata and guard cells in the leaf epidermis of a spiderwort. © Ed Reschke/GettyLeaf pores are a double-edged sword: the openings allow a plant to suck-up the carbon dioxide it needs to make food, but they also let precious water escape. While early plants had to cope with losing water passively through pores that were just holes, modern species have structures called stomata that actively adjust an aperture's size in response to physiological or environmental cues. Stomata therefore help a plant to minimise water loss, balanced with gaining carbon for photosynthesis.More like thisDo aquatic plants have stomata?The gas exchange that occurs via stomata for land plants is different for aquatic plants. If an aquatic plant were covered in tiny holes, it would drown. So in water lilies and other flowering plants with floating leaves, only the upper side of a leaf has stomata – and those pores are permanently open because aquatic plants don't really need to worry about losing moisture. It seems to work well, as floating plants have emerged at least 13 times independently by convergent evolution.Some flowering plants are even adapted to a submerged lifestyle: seagrasses lack stomata completely and carry out photosynthesis, but they must rely on bacteria in shallow ocean sediments to provide a source of carbon in the absence of CO2.How do organisms capture light?The cells of photosynthetic organisms convert light to chemical energy through photosystems – a combination of pigments, enzymes and other molecules. The core component of a photosystem is the green pigment chlorophyll.After being hit by photons (particles that make up light), electrons in chlorophyll absorb enough energy to break free, which starts a chain reaction in which energised electrons are passed between intermediates to generate the molecules ATP and NADPH, whose chemical bonds carry the energy that's later released to make food. In plants, chlorophyll's lost electrons are replaced by splitting water, releasing oxygen.Is chlorophyll the only pigment?Red coralline algae in Point Fermin Park in San Pedro, CA. © Pam Susemiehl/GettyNo, but it's the best at absorbing sunlight near the blue end of the visible spectrum, where photons have greater energy. Many organisms, especially aquatic species, also have accessory pigments such as phycobilin that are more efficient at harnessing photon energies toward the red end of the spectrum, allowing those wavelengths to be absorbed if water has filtered-out blue light. The distinctive colour of red algae is explained by the presence of large amounts of phycobilin.So how is food made from carbon dioxide?Like making drinks in a slushie machine that continually rotates and is refilled with flavouring and ice, photosynthetic cells produce carbohydrates by recycling them and replenishing the supply of carbon by regularly adding carbon dioxide (and usually water). That involves a circular series of reactions popularly called the Calvin cycle, which is driven by the energy-carrying molecules ATP and NADPH.The first step in that cycle involves carbon fixation: adding or 'fixing' carbon dioxide (a volatile gas) to a stable compound, a reaction catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCO. Because it constitutes an estimated 3 per cent of the total mass in leaves, and most of Earth's biomass is plant matter, RuBisCO is arguably the most abundant protein on the planet. And because the enzyme's activity ends-up producing more than 90 per cent of organic carbon, RuBisCO is one of nature's most important proteins.Do any animals photosynthesise?The tiny polyps of form a symbiotic relationship with algae, providing a home and the nutrients required for photosynthesis and benefiting from food generated by the algae.Some sea slugs are able retain the chloroplasts after grazing on algae, and these are engulfed by their own cells. They also assimilate some of the algal genes, enabling them to produce cholorophyll. The slugs have been recorded using the pilfered structures to sustain themselves for up to ten months, earning them the nickname ‘solar-powered sea slugs’.Spotted salamander. © Julie DeRoche/Design Pics/GettySo far, only one vertebrate is known to have a comparable association with algae – the spotted salamander (pictured above), a very striking amphibian found in the eastern United States and Canada. Soon after being laid, the salamander’s eggs are colonised by water-dwelling algae, which turn the gelatinous spheres green. The algae appear to thrive on wast, such as ammonia produced by the developing salamander embryos, and in turn provide oxygen and carbon. This enables the embryos to develop faster, increasing their survival rates. The algae more or less disappear by the time the larvae hatch, so the partnership appears temporary.This Q&A originally appeared in BBC Wildlife, and was answered by Laurie Jackson.AdvertisementMain image: Large green hosta leaves. © Maryna Terletska/GettyAuthorsScience communicatorJV Chamary is an award-winning journalist with a PhD in evolutionary biology.

0,canr.msu,Chloroplasts and Photosynthesis - Molecular Biology of the ...,https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_important_role_of_photosynthesis,"The important role of photosynthesis - MSU Extension Search Search The important role of photosynthesis Bill Cook, - April 09, 2013 Photosynthesis is not just about oxygen production it is also about energy production. Most people would agree that photosynthesis is a great thing. I’ve never heard anyone argue against it. However, some folks have missed the purpose of photosynthesis. It’s not oxygen production. The primary function of photosynthesis is to convert solar energy into chemical energy and then store that chemical energy for future use. For the most part, the planet’s living systems are powered by this process. It’s not particularly efficient by human engineering standards, but it does the job. Photosynthesis happens in regions of a cell called chloroplasts. The chemistry and physics are complex. It’s a bit humbling to consider that the energy in our bodies travels 93 million miles in a little more than eight minutes, and that life has tapped into that energy stream. For a short time that energy is tied up in biological systems before it continues on its merry way into the dark of space. In essence, green plants take carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from the molecules of carbon dioxide and water, and then recombine them into a new molecule called glucose. This happens in the presence of sunlight, of course. Energy is stored in the bonds of the glucose molecule. Glucose is a fairly simple sugar, easy to break down. Ever wonder why kids bounce off the walls and ceilings soon after a good dose of sugar? Chemically speaking, the inputs to photosynthesis are six carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms and 18 oxygen atoms. Glucose uses six carbon, 12 hydrogen, and six oxygen molecules. Simple math shows 12 leftover oxygen atoms, or six oxygen molecules. Oxygen atoms prefer mates. Interestingly, and not coincidentally, the process of respiration breaks apart the glucose molecule. Respiration occurs in the cells of nearly all living things. The released energy is then used for all sorts of metabolic activity, including the energy that you are using to read this article. Respiration happens in regions of a cell called mitochondria. The chemical reactions are the reverse of photosynthesis, using a glucose molecule and six oxygen molecules (12 atoms) as inputs. Energy is released along with some carbon dioxide and water. But this is enough chemistry. Trees and other green plants practice respiration, too, just like animals, but they also practice photosynthesis. This is why ecologists categorize green plants as “producers” and most every other life form as a “consumer.” It’s about the energy. OK, there are decomposers, too, but that’s another story and they’re still dependent upon the energy captured by the producers. Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis and, correspondingly, carbon dioxide the byproduct of respiration. Trees are often credited as the major oxygen generator for the planet, but that would be false. Most of the planet is covered with water and the collective photosynthesis of lowly algae is the true oxygen machine. Nevertheless, trees and forests are, indeed, significant oxygen producers. However, if oxygen was the only benefit of trees and forests, we could easily live without them. And some forests actually produce more carbon dioxide than oxygen. Fortunately, the benefits of both trees and forests extend far beyond something as narrow as oxygen production. Much of the basic structural material of plants and wood is cellulose, which is an especially complex sugar. The constituent molecules of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen can be recombined to form lots of useful chemicals such as ethanol, perfumes, bioplastics, clothing fabrics and a range of industrial ingredients. It’s generally agreed that sources from within renewable living ecosystems have distinct advantages over using the ancient materials that make up fossil fuels. Plants and photosynthesis are the basis of fossil fuels, too, but from millions and millions of years ago. Bringing huge volumes of those molecules back into living ecosystems has a few drawbacks that science has gotten pretty good at measuring and describing. Trees, forests, forest soils and forest products are mighty important in the cycling of carbon and the relative size of various carbon pools. There are other elements that also cycle through forests. Science has a pretty good handle on these relationships, too. Michigan residents might do well to place a bit more weight on these service benefits of trees, forests, and forest management. As for photosynthesis itself, maybe it’s better if we think more about the energy capture and less about the oxygen production. This article was published by . For more information, visit .

Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy (E = h v) to chemical energy and storing it in the chemical bonds of sugar-like molecules. This process occurs in plants and some algae (Kingdom Protista). Plants need only light energy, CO2, and H2O to make sugar. The process of photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplasts (chloro = green; plasti = formed, molded), specifically using chlorophyll (phyll = leaf), the green pigment involved in photosynthesis. How is light energy harvested in photosynthesis and what is the reaction center? As early as 1640, people have demonstrated that photosynthesis was a means of converting carbon dioxide in the air into plant material. Thus, photosynthesis has been studied by many scientists, and there are many sites related to photosynthesis. Some of these sites describe their recent recent research activities, whereas others are for educational purposes. Even books and journals are introduced in this link. The photosynthesis is a very complicated process, and we can only give an introduction here. Photosynthesis reduces carbon dioxide into carbohydrates, \[\ce{6 CO2 + 12 H2O + hv -> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O}\] Thus, both electrons and energy are required. The electrons come from water molecules, and the energy is first absorbed by pigments known as chlorophylls and carotenoids. The former absorb blue (wavelength 430 nm) and red (wavelength 670 nm) light and the later absorbe blue-green light (wavelenghts between 400 and 500 nm). Green and yellow light are not absorbed. Reflection of these types of light makes plants appear green. There are many varieties of pigments. They are bonded to proteins which provide pigment molecules with the appropriate orientation and position with respect to each other. After absorption by pigment, light energy is transferred to chlorophylls that are bonded to special proteins. Pigments and protein involved with this actual primary electron transfer event together are called the reaction center. A large number of pigment molecules (100-5000), collectively referred to as antenna, ""harvest"" light and transfer the light energy to the same reaction center. The purpose is to maintain a high rate of electron transfer in the reaction center, even at lower light intensities. What are produced and consumed in plants respiration? Photosynthesis is responsible for the production of oxygen and carbohydrates in plants. All living organisms respire, and so do plants. In the respiration, oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is produced. respiration takes place all the time, but respiration is masked by higher rate of photosynthesis when the light intensities is high. What is the Calvin-Benson cycle? Working with the green algae chlorella, Melvin Calvin and Andy Benson, at the University of California at Berkeley, elucidated the following pathway for the conversion of carbon dioxide into carbohydrates: Contributors and Attributions (Professor Emeritus, Chemistry @ University of Waterloo) This page titled is shared under a license and was authored, remixed, and/or curated by .

In order for water to perform those important functions, it needs to be replenished, purified, and circulated again and again.The Water Cycle Steps Explained:The simplest way to describe the water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. It involves the exchange of heat energy, which leads to changes in temperature and moisture levels in the atmosphere, oceans, and land. The water cycle is driven by solar energy and involves several stages including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and runoff. These stages are connected, and water can move from one stage to the next, eventually returning to oceans and other bodies of water where the cycle starts again.The water cycle has many effects including the regulation of temperature and weather, circulating important minerals, and creating various geographical features.The labeled water cycle diagram below illustrates some of those main functions in the water cycle. Water CycleThe 7 Stages of the Water Cycle:Let’s dive a little deeper into the water cycle steps and how they work.Step 1: EvaporationThe first of the water cycle steps begins with evaporation. It is a process where water at the surface turns into water vapors. Water absorbs heat energy from the sun and turns into vapors. Water bodies like oceans, seas, lakes and rivers are the main source of evaporation. Through evaporation, water moves from hydrosphere to atmosphere. As water evaporates it reduces the temperature of those water bodies.Step 2: condensationAs water vaporizes into water vapor, it rises up in the atmosphere. At high altitudes the water vapor changes into very tiny particles of ice /water droplets because of low temperature. This process is called condensation. These particles come close together and form clouds and fogs in the sky.Step 3: SublimationApart from evaporation, sublimation also contributes to water vapors in the air. Sublimation is a process where ice directly converts into water vapors without converting into liquid water. This phenomenon accelerates when the temperature is low or pressure is high. The main sources of water from sublimation are the ice sheets of the North Pole and the South Pole and the ice caps on the mountains. Sublimation is a rather slower process than evaporation.Step 4: PrecipitationThe clouds (condensed water vapors) then pour down as precipitation due to wind or temperature change. This occurs because the water droplets combine to make bigger droplets, so when the air cannot hold any more water, it precipitates. At high altitudes the temperature is low and hence the droplets lose their heat energy. These water droplets fall down as rain. If the temperature is very low (below 0 degrees), then the water droplets would fall as snow. In addition, water could also precipice in the form of drizzle, sleet and hail. Hence water enters lithosphere by landing upon the earth.Step 5: TranspirationAs water precipitates, some of it is absorbed by the soil. This water enters into the process of transpiration. Transpiration is a process similar to evaporation where liquid water is turned into water vapor by the plants. The roots of the plants absorb the water and push it toward leaves where it is used for photosynthesis. The extra water is moved out of leaves through stomata (very tiny openings on leaves) as water vapor. Thus water enters the biosphere (plants and animals) and exits into a gaseous phase.Step 6: RunoffAs the water pours down (in whatever form), it leads to runoff. Runoff is the process where water runs over the surface of earth. When the snow melts into water it also leads to runoff. As water runs over the ground it displaces the top soil with it and moves the minerals along with the stream. This runoff combines to form channels, rivers and ends up into lakes, seas and oceans. Here the water enters the hydrosphere.Step 7: InfiltrationAny water that doesn't run directly to bodies of water or get quickly evaporated, will be absorbed by plants and soil, where it may be driven deeper to the earth. This is called infiltration. The water seeps down and increases the level of the ground water table. Underground water tables typically provide pure clean water that is safe to drink. The infiltration is measured as inches of water-soaked by the soil per hour. What Is Our Role?As benefactors of the water cycle, we sometimes interfere with or take advantage of the process in order to reach our own goals. Whether it be for better or for worse, we humans alter the water cycle through activities such as:Deforestation: Trees help regulate the water cycle by transpiring water vapor into the atmosphere and slowing down runoff. Deforestation reduces these natural processes and increases runoff and evaporation.Urbanization: Urbanization changes the land cover and increases the amount of impermeable surfaces like asphalt and concrete, reducing the amount of water that infiltrates into the ground and increasing runoff.Agricultural practices: Irrigation, for example, moves water from one location to another and changes the amount and timing of water available for plants and animals.Water withdrawals: Withdrawing water from rivers, lakes, and aquifers for domestic, agricultural, and industrial use, reduces the amount of water available for other parts of the water cycle, and affects the ecosystems in the environments from which we collect water.Climate change: Human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation contribute to climate change, which can alter the water cycle by changing precipitation patterns, temperatures, and evaporation rates. How Does Water Filtration Fit In?Water filtration is an important part of the water cycle as it helps to clean and purify water that has been contaminated by pollutants and other impurities.

The water cycle is the path that all water follows as it moves around our planet. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Data source: On Earth, you can find water in all three states of matter: solid, liquid and gas. Liquid water is found in Earth’s oceans, rivers, lakes, streams—and even in the soil and underground. Solid ice is found in , snow, and at the . Water vapor—a gas—is found in Earth’s atmosphere. How does water travel from a glacier to the ocean to a cloud? That’s where the water cycle comes in. The Water Cycle Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The Sun’s heat causes glaciers and snow to melt into liquid water. This water goes into oceans, lakes and streams. Water from melting snow and ice also goes into the soil. There, it supplies water for plants and the groundwater that we drink. Snow falling on a glacier during winter months usually replaces any water that melts away in the summer. However, due to , most glaciers today are losing more ice than they regain, causing them to shrink over time. How does water get into the atmosphere? There are two main ways this happens: Heat from the Sun causes water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and streams. Evaporation occurs when liquid water on Earth’s surface turns into water vapor in our atmosphere. Water from plants and trees also enters the atmosphere. This is called transpiration. Warm water vapor rises up through Earth’s atmosphere. As the water vapor rises higher and higher, the cool air of the atmosphere causes the water vapor to turn back into liquid water, creating clouds. This process is called condensation. When a cloud becomes full of liquid water, it falls from the sky as rain or snow—also known as precipitation. Rain and snow then fill lakes and streams, and the process starts all over again. Clouds, like these over the savannah in Nairobi, Kenya, form when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses back into liquid water. Credit: Department of State Why Do We Care About the Water Cycle? We care about the water cycle because water is necessary for all living things. NASA satellites orbiting Earth right now are helping us to understand what is happening with water on our planet. Water in the Soil Humans need water to drink, and to water the plants that grow our food. NASA has a satellite called SMAP—short for Soil Moisture Active Passive—that measures how much water is in the top 2 inches (5 cm) of Earth’s .

0,en.wikipedia,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle,"water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. The mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the partitioning of the water into the major reservoirs of ice, fresh water, saline water (salt water) and atmospheric water is variable depending on a wide range of climatic variables. The water moves from one reservoir to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. In doing so, the water goes through different forms: liquid, solid (ice) and vapor. The ocean plays a key role in the water cycle as it is the source of 86% of global evaporation. The water cycle involves the exchange of energy, which leads to changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence . The evaporative phase of the cycle purifies water which then replenishes the land with freshwater. The flow of liquid water and ice transports minerals across the globe. It is also involved in reshaping the geological features of the Earth, through processes including and .

This energy heats water in the ocean and seas. Water evaporates as water vapor into the . Some ice and snow directly into water vapor. is water from plants and evaporated from the soil. The water molecule H2O has smaller than the major components of the atmosphere, nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) and hence is less dense. Due to the significant difference in density, drives humid air higher. As altitude increases, air pressure decreases and the temperature drops (see ). The lower temperature causes water vapor to condense into tiny liquid water droplets which are heavier than the air, and which fall unless supported by an updraft. A huge concentration of these droplets over a large area in the atmosphere becomes visible as , while condensation near ground level is referred to as . moves water vapor around the globe; cloud particles collide, grow, and fall out of the upper atmospheric layers as . Some precipitation falls as snow, hail, or sleet, and can accumulate in and , which can store frozen water for thousands of years. Most water falls as rain back into the ocean or onto land, where the water flows over the ground as . A portion of this runoff enters rivers, with streamflow moving water towards the oceans. Runoff and water emerging from the ground () may be stored as freshwater in lakes. Not all runoff flows into rivers; much of it soaks into the ground as . Some water infiltrates deep into the ground and replenishes , which can store freshwater for long periods of time. Some infiltration stays close to the land surface and can seep back into surface-water bodies (and the ocean) as groundwater discharge or be taken up by plants and transferred back to the atmosphere as water vapor by . Some groundwater finds openings in the land surface and emerges as freshwater springs. In river valleys and , there is often continuous water exchange between surface water and ground water in the . Over time, the water returns to the ocean, to continue the water cycle. The ocean plays a key role in the water cycle. The ocean holds ""97% of the total water on the planet; 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean, and it is the source of 86% of global evaporation"". Processes leading to movements and phase changes in water Important physical processes within the water cycle include the following (in alphabetical order): : The movement of water through the atmosphere. Without advection, water that evaporated over the oceans could not precipitate over land. that move large volumes of water vapor over long distances are an example of advection. : The transformation of water vapor to liquid water droplets in the air, creating and fog. : The transformation of water from liquid to gas phases as it moves from the ground or bodies of water into the overlying atmosphere. The source of energy for evaporation is primarily . Evaporation often implicitly includes from , though together they are specifically referred to as . Total annual evapotranspiration amounts to approximately 505,000 km3 (121,000 cu mi) of water, 434,000 km3 (104,000 cu mi) of which evaporates from the oceans. 86% of global evaporation occurs over the ocean. : The flow of water from the ground surface into the ground. Once infiltrated, the water becomes or groundwater. A recent global study using water stable isotopes, however, shows that not all soil moisture is equally available for or for plant transpiration. : Water flows vertically through the soil and rocks under the influence of . : Condensed water vapor that falls to the Earth's surface. Most precipitation occurs as , but also includes , , , , and . Approximately 505,000 km3 (121,000 cu mi) of water falls as precipitation each year, 398,000 km3 (95,000 cu mi) of it over the oceans. The rain on land contains 107,000 km3 (26,000 cu mi) of water per year and a snowing only 1,000 km3 (240 cu mi). 78% of global precipitation occurs over the ocean. : The variety of ways by which water moves across the land. This includes both surface runoff and . As it flows, the water may seep into the ground, evaporate into the air, become stored in lakes or reservoirs, or be extracted for agricultural or other human uses. : The flow of water underground, in the and . Subsurface water may return to the surface (e.g. as a spring or by being pumped) or eventually seep into the oceans. Water returns to the land surface at lower elevation than where it infiltrated, under the force of or gravity induced pressures. Groundwater tends to move slowly and is replenished slowly, so it can remain in aquifers for thousands of years. : The release of water vapor from plants and soil into the air.

It is a measure of the average age of the water in that reservoir. Groundwater can spend over 10,000 years beneath Earth's surface before leaving. Particularly old groundwater is called . Water stored in the soil remains there very briefly, because it is spread thinly across the Earth, and is readily lost by evaporation, transpiration, stream flow, or groundwater recharge. After evaporating, the residence time in the atmosphere is about 9 days before condensing and falling to the Earth as precipitation. The major ice sheets – and – store ice for very long periods. Ice from Antarctica has been reliably dated to 800,000 years before present, though the average residence time is shorter. In hydrology, residence times can be estimated in two ways.[] The more common method relies on the principle of () and assumes the amount of water in a given reservoir is roughly constant. With this method, residence times are estimated by dividing the volume of the reservoir by the rate by which water either enters or exits the reservoir. Conceptually, this is equivalent to timing how long it would take the reservoir to become filled from empty if no water were to leave (or how long it would take the reservoir to empty from full if no water were to enter). An alternative method to estimate residence times, which is gaining in popularity for dating groundwater, is the use of techniques. This is done in the subfield of . Water in storage Further information: and Water cycle showing human influences and major pools (storages) and fluxes. The water cycle describes the processes that drive the movement of water throughout the . However, much more water is ""in storage"" (or in ""pools"") for long periods of time than is actually moving through the cycle. The storehouses for the vast majority of all water on Earth are the oceans. It is estimated that of the 1,386,000,000 km3 of the world's water supply, about 1,338,000,000 km3 is stored in oceans, or about 97%. It is also estimated that the oceans supply about 90% of the evaporated water that goes into the water cycle. The Earth's ice caps, glaciers, and permanent snowpack stores another 24,064,000 km3 accounting for only 1.7% of the planet's total water volume. However, this quantity of water is 68.7% of all freshwater on the planet. Changes caused by humans (heavy rains, , ) is one consequence of a . These events will be progressively more common as the Earth warms more and more.: Figure SPM.6 Predicted changes in average soil moisture for a scenario of 2°C global warming.

This section is an excerpt from .[] The are profound and have been described as an intensification or a strengthening of the water cycle (also called hydrologic cycle).: 1079 This effect has been observed since at least 1980.: 1079 One example is the intensification of heavy events. This has important negative effects on the availability of resources, as well as other water reservoirs such as oceans, ice sheets, atmosphere and land surface. The water cycle is essential to life on Earth and plays a large role in the global climate and the . The is expected to cause changes in the water cycle for various reasons. For example, warmer atmosphere can contain more water vapor which has effects on and . The underlying cause of the intensifying water cycle is the increased amount of greenhouse gases, which lead to a warmer atmosphere through the . Physics dictates that increases by 7% when temperature rises by 1 °C (as described in the ). The strength of the water cycle and its changes over time are of considerable interest, especially as the climate changes. The essence of the overall hydrological cycle is the evaporation of moisture in one place and the precipitation in other places. In particular, evaporation exceeds precipitation over the oceans, which allows moisture to be transported by the atmosphere from the oceans onto land where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration, and the runoff flows into streams and rivers and discharges into the ocean, completing the cycle. The water cycle is a key part of through the evaporative cooling at the surface which provides latent heat to the atmosphere, as atmospheric systems play a primary role in moving heat upward. Changes due to other human activities Relationship between and Human activities, other than those that lead to global warming from , can also alter the water cycle. The stated that there is ""abundant evidence that and alter the water cycle globally, regionally and locally, by changing precipitation, evaporation, flooding, groundwater, and the availability of freshwater for a variety of uses"".: 1153 Examples for such land use changes are converting fields to urban areas or . Such changes can affect the ability of soils to soak up surface water. Deforestation has local as well as regional effects. For example it reduces soil moisture, evaporation and rainfall at the local level. Furthermore, deforestation causes regional temperature changes that can affect rainfall patterns.: 1153 Aquifer or and the pumping of fossil water increase the total amount of water in the hydrosphere. This is because the water that was originally in the ground has now become available for evaporation as it is now in contact with the atmosphere.: 1153 Related processes Biogeochemical cycling While the water cycle is itself a , flow of water over and beneath the Earth is a key component of the cycling of other biogeochemicals.

Historical interpretations Floating land mass In ancient times, it was widely thought that the land mass floated on a body of water, and that most of the water in rivers has its origin under the earth. Examples of this belief can be found in the works of (circa 800 BCE). Hebrew Bible In the , Hebrew scholars observed that even though the rivers ran into the sea, the sea never became full. Some scholars conclude that the water cycle was described completely during this time in this passage: ""The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits. All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again"" (). Scholars are not in agreement as to the date of Ecclesiastes, though most scholars point to a date during the time of , son of David and Bathsheba, ""three thousand years ago, there is some agreement that the time period is 962–922 BCE. Furthermore, it was also observed that when the clouds were full, they emptied rain on the earth (). In addition, during 793–740 BCE a Hebrew prophet, Amos, stated that water comes from the sea and is poured out on the earth (). In the Biblical , dated between 7th and 2nd centuries BCE, there is a description of precipitation in the hydrologic cycle, ""For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof; which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly"" (). Understanding of precipitation and percolation In the (a devotional hymn to the Sun God) of , a Hindu epic dated to the 4th century BCE, it is mentioned in the 22nd verse that the Sun heats up water and sends it down as rain. By roughly 500 BCE, Greek scholars were speculating that much of the water in rivers can be attributed to rain. The origin of rain was also known by then. These scholars maintained the belief, however, that water rising up through the earth contributed a great deal to rivers. Examples of this thinking included (570 BCE) (who also speculated about the ) and (530 BCE). Chinese scholars such as Chi Ni Tzu (320 BCE) and Lu Shih Ch'un Ch'iu (239 BCE) had similar thoughts. The idea that the water cycle is a closed cycle can be found in the works of (460 BCE) and (460 BCE). Both (390 BCE) and (350 BCE) speculated about percolation as part of the water cycle. Aristotle correctly hypothesized that the sun played a role in the Earth's hydraulic cycle in his book , writing ""By it [the sun's] agency the finest and sweetest water is everyday carried up and is dissolved into vapor and rises to the upper regions, where it is condensed again by the cold and so returns to the earth."", and believed that clouds were composed of cooled and condensed water vapor. Up to the time of the Renaissance, it was wrongly assumed that precipitation alone was insufficient to feed rivers, for a complete water cycle, and that underground water"

0,byjus,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://byjus.com/biology/water-cycle/,"Water Cycle? The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle or the hydrological cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface of the Earth. Water Cycle Diagram During this process, water changes its state from one phase to another, but the total number of water particles remains the same. In other words, if it were possible to collect and boil 100 gms of water, it will still retain a mass of 100 gms as steam. Likewise, if 100 gms of steam is collected and condensed, the resultant water would still weight 100 gms. Water changes its state through a variety of processes from evaporation, melting and freezing, to sublimation, condensation, and deposition. All these changes require the application of energy. Stages of Water Cycle There are many processes involved in the movement of water apart from the major steps given in the above water cycle diagram. Listed below are different stages of the water cycle. 1. Evaporation The sun is the ultimate source of energy, and it powers most of the evaporation that occurs on earth. Evaporation generally happens when water molecules at the surface of water bodies become excited and rise into the air. These molecules with the highest kinetic energy accumulate into water vapour clouds. Evaporation usually takes place below the boiling point of water. Another process called evapotranspiration occurs when evaporation occurs through the leaves of plants. This process contributes to a large percentage of water in the atmosphere. 2. Sublimation Sublimation occurs when snow or ice changes directly into water vapour without becoming water. It usually occurs as a result of dry winds and low humidity. Sublimation can be observed on mountain peaks, where the air pressure is quite low. The low air pressure helps to sublimate the snow into water vapour as less energy is utilised in the process. Another example of sublimation is the phase where fog bellows from dry ice. On earth, the primary source of sublimation is from the ice sheets covering the poles of the earth. 3. Condensation The water vapour that accumulated in the atmosphere eventually cools down due to the low temperatures found at high altitudes. These vapours become tiny droplets of water and ice, eventually coming together to form clouds. 4. Precipitation Above 0 degrees centigrade, the vapours will condense into water droplets. However, it cannot condense without dust or other impurities. Hence, water vapours attach itself on to the particle’s surface. When enough droplets merge, it falls out of the clouds and on to the ground below. This process is called precipitation (or rainfall). In particularly cold weather or extremely low air pressure, the water droplets freeze and fall as snow or hail. 5. Infiltration Rainwater gets absorbed into the ground through the process of infiltration. The level of absorption varies based on the material the water has seeped into. For instance, rocks will retain comparatively less water than soil. Groundwater can either follows streams or rivers. But sometimes, it might just sink deeper, forming aquifers. 6. Runoff If the water from rainfall does not form aquifers, it follows gravity, often flowing down the sides of mountains and hills; eventually forming rivers. This process is called runoff. In colder regions, icecaps form when the amount of snowfall is faster than the rate of evaporation or sublimation. The biggest icecaps on earth are found at the poles. All the steps mentioned above occur cyclically with neither a fixed beginning nor an end. Also Read: Implications of Water Cycle The water cycle has a tremendous impact on the climate. For instance, the greenhouse effect will cause a rise in temperature. Without the evaporative cooling effect of the water cycle, the temperature on earth would rise drastically. The water cycle is also an integral part of other biogeochemical cycles. Water cycle affects all life processes on earth. The water cycle is also known the clean the air. For instance, during the process of precipitation, water vapours have to attach themselves on to particles of dust. In polluted cities, the raindrops, apart from picking up dust, also pick up water-soluble gas and pollutants as they fall from the clouds. Raindrops are also known to pick up biological agents such as bacteria and industrial soot particles and smoke.

And the water you see in a river or stream may have been snow on a high mountaintop. Water is in the atmosphere, on the land, in the ocean, and underground. It moves from place to place through the water cycle. Where's the water? There are about 1.4 billion km3 of water (336 million mi3 of water) on Earth. That includes liquid water in the ocean, lakes, and rivers. It includes frozen water in snow, ice, and glaciers, and water that’s underground in soils and rocks. It includes the water that’s in the as and vapor. If you could put all that water together – like a gigantic water drop – it would be 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) across. Of all the water in the hydrosphere, the vast majority, about 97% of it, fills the ocean. About 2% of the water on Earth is frozen in ice sheets near the poles and in glaciers. Sometimes the ice on Earth is included in the hydrosphere and sometimes it's seperated into a special part of the Earth system called the cryosphere. Most of the ice is in Antarctica, a smaller amount in Greenland in the Arctic, and a tiny fraction in mountain glaciers around the world. Most of the remaining 1% of Earth’s water is underground, in shallow aquifers, as soil moisture, or deep underground in rock layers. Only a small fraction of the water on Earth (0.03%) is in lakes, wetlands, and rivers. The main processes in the water cycle Credit: NASA Water's on the move. As it moves through the water cycle, water often changes from a liquid, to a solid (ice), to a gas (water vapor). Water in oceans and lakes is typically liquid; but it is solid ice in glaciers, and often invisible water vapor in the . Clouds are tiny droplets of liquid water or small ice crystals. Water at the surface of the ocean, rivers, and lakes can become water vapor and move into the atmosphere with a little added energy from the through a process called evaporation. Snow and ice can also turn into water vapor, which is a process known as sublimation. And water vapor gets into the atmosphere from plants, too, which is called transpiration. Because air is cooler at higher altitude in the , water vapor cools as it rises high in the atmosphere and transforms into water droplets by a process called condensation. The water droplets that form make up clouds. Water vapor can also condense into droplets near the ground, forming fog when the ground is cold. If the temperature is cold enough, ice crystals form instead of liquid water droplets. If the droplets or ice crystals within clouds grow in size, they eventually become too heavy to stay in the air, falling to the ground as rain, snow, and other types of precipitation. What happens to the rain and snow that fall? Around the world, each year, about 505,000 km3 (121,000 mi3) of water falls as rain, snow, and other types of precipitation. 86% of those raindrops and snowflakes come from the ocean where 434,000 km3(104,000 mi3) of water evaporates into the each year. Water eventually returns to the ocean as precipitation that falls directly into the sea and as precipitation that falls on land and flows to the ocean through rivers. Less water evaporates over the land than falls onto land as precipitation. Evaporation of water from the land happens directly from lakes, puddles, and other surface water. Also, water also makes its way into the atmosphere via a process called transpiration in which plants release water into the air from their leaves that was pulled up from the soil through roots. Collectively, the water evaporated from the land and from plants is called evapotranspiration. Some of the snow and ice that falls as precipitation stays on the land as a part of icy mountaintop glaciers or the ice sheets that cover places like Greenland and Antarctica. Some of the precipitation seeps into the ground and joins the groundwater that is often tapped by wells to provide water to farms, towns, and cities.

So, how does this cycle works? When the sun shines, the water from the ocean or lake evaporates due to heat from the sun. When water evaporates, it turns into water vapor and goes up into the atmosphere. This water vapor gets together with other water vapor and turns into a cloud. When clouds get dense, they drop the water back to Earth in some form of precipitation like rain, snow, hail or sleet. When the water falls back down to the Earth, they find their way on the ground surface into puddles, streams and rivers. Again this water will evaporate, and the whole cycle will start again. is one of the world’s most valuable resources and one that is becoming increasingly difficult to find in drinkable quality. All water in the world is subject to what is known as the water cycle, or the hydrologic cycle, or the H2O cycle, which is the process by which water moves around the world. Let’s have a look at different states and the importance of the water cycle. Different Stages of the Water Cycle Water goes through three different stages in the water cycle. It can be a liquid (water), a gas (water vapor) or a solid (ice). These three states are interchangeable, as water can freeze into ice or evaporate into water vapor, water vapor can condense as water, and ice can melt into water. The water cycle consists of a number of steps that see the water go through each of these states. 1. Evaporation Water is found in lakes, oceans, swamps, and soil, as well as in all living creatures and plants. When heat is applied from the sun, through exertion, or by artificial means, the water molecules become excited and spread out. The loss of density is called ‘evaporation,’ and it sees the water rise into the air forming clouds of water vapor. Normally, the evaporation of water occurs when the water hits the boiling point, around one hundred degrees centigrade. However, in places where the air pressure and humidity are lower, far less heat energy is needed to evaporate the water because there is less pressure holding the water molecules together. The water that evaporates from the oceans is not salty, as the salt is too dense and heavy to rise with the water vapor, which is why water from rivers and lakes is not salty. Snow and ice can actually turn into water vapor without first turning into water. This process is called ‘sublimation,’ and it results from low humidity and dry winds. This usually occurs at the peaks of mountains or other high-up places, as the lower air pressure means that less energy is needed to sublimate the ice into water vapor. Some of the highest peaks on the earth, such as Mount Everest, have all of the necessary components for sublimation, namely: strong sunlight, low temperatures, low air pressure, strong wind, and low humidity. If you’ve ever seen dry ice, which has a fog pouting off of it, this is an example of sublimation in action. When water evaporates off of a plant’s leaves, the process is known as ‘evapotranspiration.’ A large percentage of the water in the atmosphere is produced by this process due to the large areas covered by plants and trees across the planet. While about ninety percent of the water vapor in the world comes from lakes, oceans, and streams, the remaining ten percent is comprised of the various plant life around the world. 2. Condensation The water vapor that has risen into the sky cools significantly when it comes into contact with the cooler air found up high. The vapor becomes a cloud, which is pushed around the world by moving air currents and winds. If the water vapor cools to anything above zero degrees centigrade, it will condense as water. Essentially, the water vapor will start to condense on the surface of tiny particles of dust and dirt that rose with the vapor during the process of evaporation. These tiny droplets will start to fall into one another and merge, producing a larger droplet. When a droplet is large enough, gravity will pull it down at a rate that exceeds the updraft in the cloud, leading to the droplet falling out of the cloud and onto the ground below. This process is called ‘precipitation’, or – more commonly – rainfall. If precipitation occurs in conditions that are particularly cold or have very low air pressure, then these water droplets can quite often crystallize and freeze. This causes the water to fall as solid ice, known as hail, or as snow. If the conditions are in between those associated with snow and rain, the droplets will fall as icy cold, half-frozen water commonly referred to as sleet. 3. Precipitation The water that has fallen as rain is absorbed into the ground through a process known as ‘infiltration.’ Soil and other porous materials can absorb great deals of water this way, while rocks and other harder substances will only retain a small amount of water. When the water infiltrates the soil, it will move in all directions until it either seeps into nearby streams or else sinks deeper into what is known as ‘groundwater storage.’ This is where the water that does not seep out or evaporate joins up under the ground, saturating the smallest nooks and crannies of rock and soil under the ground. These formations are also known as ‘aquifers’ and explain why sometimes the ground underneath the topsoil is damp or sodden. When an aquifer becomes too full, it starts to leak out onto the surface, forming what is known commonly as a ‘spring.’ These can often be found in formations of porous or brittle rock, which can crack following slightly acidic rainfall. Should the water be located near a volcano or any source of natural thermal energy, it will form a hot spring. 4. Runoff After the water has fallen and the soil has become saturated, or the snow has melted, the water follows gravity and falls down any hills, mountains, or other inclines to form or join rivers. This process is known as ‘runoff,’ and it is how water comes to rest in lakes and returns to the ocean. The waterfalls according to the incline of the place from which it is falling, and when several threads of water meet, they form a stream. The direction in which the water moves is known as ‘streamflow’, and it is central to the concept of the currents within rivers and streams. These streams and rivers will run off eventually to either form lakes or rejoin the ocean, depending on their proximity to the ocean. Due to the amount of water stored in snow or ice, a sudden increase in the heat can lead to flooding due to the water suddenly melting and running off at an alarming rate. This is why flooding can occur so easily during a warm spring following a particularly cold and biting winter. When more snow falls than evaporates or sublimates, the ice will compact densely to form what is known as ‘ice caps.’ The ice caps and glaciers located in the coldest regions of the world are the biggest collections of ice in the world, and are slowly starting to shrink as the water in which they sit is becoming warmer. This happens in a cyclical manner, with no beginning or end. As precipitation happens in one part of the world, evapotranspiration is happening somewhere else. The cycle of water never ends, which is why the oceans stay level, there are always clouds somewhere in the sky, and drinkable water doesn’t suddenly just run out. At some point, any water that has infiltrated will be released, any that has joined the ocean will evaporate, and even a large portion of the ice caps may melt, releasing water that has been stored for millions of years back into the water cycle with potentially cataclysmic effects. Photo by: The Importance of the Water Cycle 1. We cannot live without freshwater All life is dependent upon water. Water makes up 60 to 70 percent of all living matter, and humans cannot live without drinking water for more than a week. The water cycle is an extremely important process because it enables the availability of water for all living organisms and regulates weather patterns on our planet. If water didn’t naturally recycle itself and distribute freshwater all over the earth’s surface, we would run out of clean water, which is essential to life. Freshwater seems abundant, but when accounting for all the water on Earth, it’s in limited supply. Just three percent of the water on our planet is freshwater. A majority of this water, about two percent of the world total, is contained in glaciers and ice sheets or stored below ground. The remaining one percent is found in lakes, rivers and wetland areas or transported through the atmosphere in the form of water vapor, clouds and precipitation. 2. Purification Evaporation and infiltration benefit human, animal and plant life by purifying water. When water evaporates, the pollutants and sediments in it are left behind. As water undergoes infiltration, the ground purifies it of pollutants and contaminants. Glaciers, ice, and snow can act as stores of freshwater for both humans and other organisms. Even aquatic life needs water purified, as saltwater must be within certain pH and saline ranges. 3. Distribution Perhaps most important, the water cycle distributes water"
0,the71percent,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://www.the71percent.org/how-does-the-water-cycle-work/,"Water changes its state from liquid, to vapor, to ice and then back again. These processes happen in the blink of an eye and over millions of years. Although the balance of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time, individual water molecules can come and go in a hurry. In our most recent blog, the professionals at Indiana American Water discuss how the water cycle works and the four main steps involved in the process. How Does the Water Cycle Work? The water cycle is also referred to as the hydrologic cycle. The water cycle describes the continuous movement of water on, above and below the surface. Through the process of recycling and purifying the water, the water cycle supports the Earth’s ecosystems and all life on Earth. It’s broken down into four main steps: Evaporation Condensation Precipitation Infiltration and Runoff Evaporation The first step in the water cycle is evaporation. Evaporation occurs when the sun heats up bodies of liquid water such as lakes, streams, rivers and oceans, allowing the water to evaporate. Once the water evaporates, it’s converted from liquid water to steam or vapor and rises into the atmosphere. It can also evaporate through plants through a process called transpiration. Condensation When the water vapor rises into the atmosphere, it cools and condenses into ice crystals or small water droplets which form clouds. Precipitation Once the water vapor or water droplets in the clouds become too heavy to stay suspended in the air any longer, precipitation falls to the ground in the form of rain, hail, sleet, and snow. Infiltration and Runoff Infiltration is when water seeps into the soil. The water is either used by plants or replenishes underground water sources such as aquifers. This is an important source of fresh water for springs, wells, and other water sources. Meanwhile, runoff occurs when either the Earth’s surface is saturated and cannot absorb more water or when it falls onto hard surfaces and flows to bodies of water. Instead of infiltrating the ground, the water flows over the surface, creating surface runoff. The liquid water flows into streams, rivers, lakes, and oceans. Benefits of the Natural Water Cycle Without the natural processes of the water cycle, there would be no life on Earth. Some of its many benefits include: Freshwater supply. The water cycle maintains a continuous supply of fresh water for humans, animals and plants. Climate regulation. When water evaporates, it absorbs heat energy from the sun to cool the surface. When the water vapor forms clouds, they can warm Earth’s surface by absorbing heat emitted from the surface and re-radiating it back down toward the surface. Soil moisture. Precipitation helps replenish the soil moisture which is essential for the energy production of plants to grow and produce oxygen. Erosion control. The natural water cycle also helps to control erosion. Water carries soil and other sediments downstream to create new habitats for animals and aquatic life. Aquifer recharge. Water that infiltrates the ground replenishes underground water sources such as aquifers to provide clean water. Indiana American Water"

The water cycle encompasses a number of processes that circulate water through the Earth’s subsystems. Water evaporates from within soils and through vegetation and from bodies of water (such as rivers, lakes and oceans). This evaporated water accumulates as water vapour in clouds and returns to the Earth as rain or snow. The returning water falls directly back into the oceans, or onto land as snow or rain. It soaks into the soil to move into the groundwater or runs off the Earth’s surface in streams, rivers and lakes, which drain back into the oceans. The water may be taken up by plants and returned to the atmosphere through processes like transpiration and photosynthesis. Water may also be returned to the atmosphere through the combustion of plants in fossil fuel. Water and the atmosphere Water enters the atmosphere through evaporation, transpiration, excretion and sublimation: Transpiration is the loss of water from plants (via their leaves). Animals excrete water by respiration and by passing urine. Sublimation is when ice or snow transforms directly into water vapour without going through a liquid phase (i.e. they do not melt). Water commonly occurs in the atmosphere in the form of water vapour. If it cools down, it can condense, accumulating in clouds. As the clouds grow, they become heavier and can fall back to the Earth as precipitation (rain, snow, hail or sleet) or re-evaporate back into vapour. Water and the biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere When water returns to Earth, it can either enter the hydrosphere or the geosphere. It can enter the hydrosphere by falling onto bodies of water or falling onto the ground. When it rains, water"
0,smartclass4kids,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://smartclass4kids.com/the-water-cycle/,"water is always moving on, above, and below the surface of the Earth.This water movement is called the water cycle that supplies all the water needed to support life.Water is constantly being recycled through the land and the atmosphere. This is called the water cycle or the hydrological cycle. How the water cycle works? The water cycle is driven by the sun. It begins when water evaporates into the air. The water cycle consists of:EVAPORATION, CONDENSATION, TRANSPIRATIONPRECIPITATIONRUNOFF/COLLECTION. Water(liquid) evaporates into water vapor (gas), condenses to form clouds, and precipitates back to Earth in the form of rain and snow. Evaporation Evaporation occurs when the sun heats water in oceans, rivers, or lakes and turns it into vapor or steam and rises into the sky. This water vapor collects in the atmosphere in the form of clouds.The water turns into an invisible gas called water vapor. This water vapor or steam rises and collects into the sky in the form of clouds. Plants also release water vapors into the atmosphere through TRANSPIRATION or EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. It adds more moisture to the air.Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water out of their leaves. Did you know? On a lake such as Lake Conroe, evaporation can cause a water loss of up to 180 million gallons on a hot summer day.Also Read: Condensation As the water vapor rises, it cools, and the water molecules clump together to form tiny water particles that collect and form clouds. Condensation is the process of water vapor turning back into liquid water through cooling. It is the reverse of evaporation, where liquid water becomes a vapor. Precipitation The water falls to Earth’s surface in the form of rain, snow, hail, or sleet is called precipitation. Precipitation occurs when tiny water droplets join together in the clouds until they become too heavy, and gravitational force pulls them down to Earth in the form of rain, snow, hail, or sleet. Runoff or Collection When water falls back on the ground as precipitation, it gets soaked and funneled into lakes, rivers, or oceans. Water that does not infiltrate the soil is called Runoff.In simple words, water flowing above the ground is known as Runoff, while the water flowing below the ground is known as Groundwater. Warm air passes over the ground and the ocean, evaporating water back into the sky again, and the cycle continues.So you can say that the amount of water on Earth never changes; it just gets cycled again and again through different forms.Also Read: In Summary - The Water Cycle Steps EVAPORATION – LIQUID (water) > Vapour (gas) through heating. When the sun heats water in oceans, rivers, or lakes and turns it into vapor or steam and rises into the sky. This water vapor collects in the atmosphere in the form of clouds. TRANSPIRATION – It happens when plants give off water vapor through their leaves into the air. CONDENSATION – GAS or VAPOUR > LIQUID through cooling. When water vapour in the air cools down and turns back into liquid water. PRECIPITATION – Precipitation happens when the water droplets get bigger and heavier and start to fall as rain, hail, sleet or snow. COLLECTION – When water falls back on the ground as precipitation, it gets soaked and funneled into lakes, rivers, or oceans. WATER RUNOFF, when the water flows over the ground and GROUNDWATER, when water is socked into the ground. The water cycle is driven by the sun’s energy and by gravity. Warm air passes over the ground and the ocean, evaporating water back into the sky. Gravity makes the moisture fall back to Earth and the cycle continues. FACT 1.

That’s because Earth has been recycling water for over 4 billion years! The world’s water moves between lakes, rivers, oceans, the atmosphere and the land in an ongoing cycle called – you guessed it! – the water cycle. As it goes through this continuous system, it can be a liquid (water), a gas (vapour) or a solid (ice). So, are all you budding young geographers ready to learn some splashing new facts? Then join NG KiDS as we take a look at the different stages of the wonderful water cycle… Evaporation Energy from the sun heats up the surface of the Earth, causing the temperature of the water in our rivers, lakes and oceans to rise. When this happens, some of the water “evaporates” into the air, turning into a gas called “vapour“. Plants and trees also lose water to the atmosphere through their leaves. This process is known as “transpiration“. Condensation As water vapour rises up high into the sky, it cools and turns back into a liquid, forming clouds. This process is called “condensation“. Currents high up in the air move these clouds around the globe. The water cycle is also known as the “hydrologic cycle“. Precipitation When too much water has condensed, the water droplets in the clouds become too big and heavy for the air to hold them. And so they fall back down to Earth as rain, snow, hail or sleet, a process known as “precipitation“. Collection The fallen precipitation is then “collected” in bodies of water – such as rivers, lakes and oceans – from where it will eventually evaporate back into the air, beginning the cycle all over again. How it is collected, depends on where it lands… Some will fall directly into lakes, rivers or the sea, from where it will evaporate and begin the cycle all over again. If the water falls on vegetation, it may evaporate from leaves back into the air, or trickle down to the ground. Some of this water may then be taken up by the plant roots in the earth. In cold climates, the precipitation may build up on land as snow, ice or glaciers. If temperatures rise, the ice will melt to liquid water and then soak into the ground, or flow into rivers or the ocean. Water that reaches land directly may flow across the ground and collect in the oceans, rivers or lakes. This water is called “surface run-off“. Some of the precipitation will instead soak (or “infiltrate”) into the soil, from where it will slowly move through the ground until eventually reaching a river or the ocean. And there you have it, gang – the ongoing water cycle! Water can change from a solid to a gas, without becoming a liquid first. Through this process of “sublimation” our planet”s ice can evaporate directly into the air without melting! Be sure to check out our .

0,owlcation,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://owlcation.com/stem/Reading-a-Water-Cycle-Diagram,"water cycle be one of the breakdowns? Let's explore the water cycle and see how it works.Physical States of WaterWater alternates between gas, liquid, and solid. What makes the difference is the temperature. High temperatures cause water to evaporate into gas (water vapor), medium temperatures produce a liquid form, and really low temperatures cause water to freeze.All over the world and in the air, water is constantly changing between these three forms. As it does, it also changes location.When liquid is heated, it changes into vapor that rises. When vapor is cooled, it coalesces into rain, sleet, hail, or snow that falls. When ice and snow (solid water) are heated, they melt into a liquid that flows to lower levels—where it's stored until it heats again, evaporates, and rises again.Thus the water cycle looks like this (from right to left on the diagram): Evaporation, condensation, precipitation, flow (runoff), storage, and repeat. Let's examine each of these stages in a little more detail, starting with storage since that's the stage that humans have deemed most useful to civilization.Water In It's Forms: Gas, Liquid, SolidWater in its gaseous form––light clouds just coalescing from water vapor, but not nearly ready to rain. Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0Rain is water in its liquid form, having cooled down from vapor (gas).Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0 (both)Snow is water in one of its solid forms. Snow will melt to liquid, then evaporate to vapor as it heats up.Where Water Is StoredYou will notice in the diagram (large arrows) that there are five main places of ""storage"" where water, in one of its three stages, collects and sits:As a solid––water is stored as ice and snow, always where temperatures are cold: The tops of mountains, the north and south poles and countries and oceans near them (icebergs), and often mid-country as well, near mountains and lakes in winter. Water is held in that form until temperatures rise and it melts. These areas are where humans enjoy ""winter sports"" like skiing, ice skating, and snowboarding. Storage of solid water has been breaking down rapidly in recent years, with snow and ice melting more and more readily, then flowing toward and merging into the salty ocean. As a gas––water that has evaporated and risen into the air stays there as vapor and clouds until it has cooled down enough to condense into rain. ""Humidity"" is the term that measures the amount of water vapor being stored in the air. Water in the air helps keep skin moist and soft. As a liquid––water is stored in three main places: Surface water, groundwater, and oceans: * Surface water includes the whole category of lakes and fake lakes (dams), rivers and streams. Lakes and dams are considered storage areas since water sits there for some time while slowly sinking into the earth, evaporating into the sky, or running out via a river or two. Water stays in a lake long enough to grow life forms, some of which we fish out.* Groundwater is water that has sunk into the earth all the way to its rock base (groundwater basin), if it has one. The earth is like a giant sponge. It holds water until needed to replenish the surface water. Meanwhile, trees, plants, and humans draw from it for their own needs.* Oceans hold the greatest quantity of water in storage. Because it is salty, humans don't like to drink it and can't use it for manufacturing without rusting or encrusting their machines. But these vast bodies of water, filled with a life of their own, are the greatest source of evaporation. Freshwater ultimately comes from the oceans in the form of water distillation––with salty water evaporating, condensing, and falling as fresh rainwater. Water Cycle ProcessIn short, these are the stages the water cycle goes through, continually cycling round and round, with no real beginning and no end:Evaporation Condensation Precipitation Flow Storage Evaporation and repeat It's not a straightforward process. Clouds can precipitate into rain, which starts to fall, only to evaporate again before it hits the ground. Or ice can start to melt, then freeze again before it ever flows anywhere. Before we go into detail about the process, therefore, let's look at the three physical states of water and what causes those.How Nature Stores WaterWater stored as a solid—iceberg and snow.Water stored as a liquid in a lake.Water heading for storage in the ground.Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0The biggest water storage place of all—the ocean.Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0How Water EvaporatesWater evaporates from any surface where there is water––the ocean, lakes, dams, rivers, streams, moist earth, snow, and ice. When it heats up with the sun or hot air or lava beneath the earth, water's molecules start spinning faster and further apart, and it gets lighter in weight. Up it goes, spinning into the air, sometimes as geysers, but higher and higher as it gets hotter and turns into water vapor (gas).Moisture is also added to the air via sweat from humans and animals, and via transpiration (plant sweat), especially from trees. All of this moisture rises into the atmosphere, spiraling up until it reaches cooler air. This is evapotranspiration.Eventually the water vapor reaches a stasis point in the atmosphere, where the air starts to cool and the vapor stays where it is, blown about by hot air and vapor still rising, which mixes and changes places with cooler air. This movement is called wind.From evapotranspiration to condensation—water vapor condensing into clouds blown about by wind.Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0Condensation of Water Vapor As the water molecules spin and others rise to join them in the cooler air above, they begin to slow down and coalesce. The more humid the air, the faster they coalesce. At 35,000 feet, even in the heat of summer, the air can be -70C (-94F). In cold air molecules spin more slowly and, being attracted to each other, gather to form clouds. This is condensation. Ground fog is condensation, heavy and thick, that sinks down to the ground.Condensation is the opposite of evaporation. Where evaporation is the change of liquid into gas, condensation starts changing gas back into liquid. All it needs to complete that process is some kind of icy core around which rain, snow, or hail can form.World Cloud CoverNote that all of the land masses clear of cloud cover are desert or near desert areas, including the SW United States. Note also the heavy cloud cover over the Amazon Jungle in South America and the Congo in Africa. ""Rain is grace; rain is the sky condescending to the earth; without rain, there would be no life."" - John Updike Precipitation into Rain, Hail, or SnowIn nature, the precipitation core is provided mainly by a bacteria called Pseudomonas syringae. This bacteria has a nucleus that is like ice, that causes water vapor to condense around it, turning water vapor into raindrops. Cooling air speeds the process, converting nascent cloud cover into storm clouds. Bacteria and storm clouds multiply and spread, until they are thick and heavy enough that gravity can pull the raindrops down from the sky.Unfortunately, P. syringae is the same bacteria that is well known for diseases it creates on cash crops. The bacteria freezes a plant's skin to soften it, so it can drink the juices beneath, then reproduces itself to form colonies. That process leaves black marks on fruit and leaves (see photo below). Growers have been trying to eradicate the bacteria for decades. Has this been decreasing rainfall?Whether the millions of bacteria needed for rain are blown up from the earth, or grow into colonies in the atmosphere, is not yet known. What we do know is that a high percentage of rain, hail, or snow contains this bacteria––around 70% according to studies by the Louisiana State University. (Volcanic dust and carbon dust from wildfires can also generate precipitation at colder levels of the atmosphere.)Ice-nucleating bacteria may well be a key component in counteracting global warming—since rain, ice, and snow both cool and clean the air and the earth. Deliberately growing the bacteria, in locations where it's especially needed, could very well provide a way of more evenly distributing rain throughout the earth.Pseudomonas Syringae Creates RainEvidence of the bacteria, Pseudomonas syringae, on a leaf. A bacterium enters the leaf by freezing and softening its skin.Clouds turn into rain from the action of ice-nucleating bacteria.Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0The Flow of Water—Runnels, Rivers, & StreamsThe flow stage of the water cycle describes the movement of water after it hits the ground. Rainwater saturates an area, flowing across the ground's surface to lower elevations. It fills up rivers and streams that flow to lakes and dams, and ultimately to the lowest elevation of the sea—quickly in the case of young, straight rivers and slowly, in the case of meandering ones.Rivers fall straighter where the elevation is steeper, pulled by gravity. Older, meandering rivers slow water down, which gives it time to be absorbed by the earth it passes over. The Mississippi River used to be an old, meandering river, saturating the ground for miles and miles on either side as it flowed south. There was once plenty of water in its aquifer from Canada down to the Caribbean Sea.Unfortunately, humans prefer straight rivers, allowing for easier and faster transportation via boats, the production of electricity, and controlled diversion for agriculture. So humans dredge crooked rivers to make them deeper, and cut paths between meanders to make them flow straighter.This prevents the ground from absorbing rainwater, lowering the storage level of the aquifer. With no water in the aquifer to replace water that evaporates or flows to the sea, rivers and streams start to run dry. Since the Mississippi River was first dredged, straightened, and dammed, many states through which it flows have experienced droughts.As surface water flows from the mountains and lakes through ever-lower rivers and streams out into the ocean, gravity pulls groundwater slowly toward the lower levels of rivers and streams, replenishing what goes to the ocean, where it evaporates again. This keeps the rivers and streams flowing until all the groundwater is gone . . . or until it rains.Until man started sucking out the groundwater for his own use, and blocking its replenishment by straightening rivers and building cities, most rivers and streams in the United States stayed full most of the year.The oceans are forever being replenished and fed by fresh water flowing down from the mountains, and the richer, saltier groundwater flowing out from the land near the oceans. Groundwater cleans the earth, collecting loose salts (and man-made chemicals) as it passes through, carrying them along to its eventual destination in the ocean. Those salts then help feed coastal ocean life, while the chemicals help kill it.Rivers and StreamsRivers run from high elevations to lower ones on their way to the sea.Susette Horspool, CC-BY-SA 3.0Some parts of the Mississippi River still meander.

You might check back on the one you missed.If you got 5 correct answers: Excellent! Couldn't have done better.How Humans Affect the Water CycleStraightening major river systems is not the only way humans have tampered with the natural water cycle. Many other ways have already been mentioned and there are still others. Here are some of them:Straightening rivers, so water runs straight to the sea, instead of being absorbed by the aquifer. Blocking the earth from absorbing rainfall by building cities, and laying concrete and asphalt across the surface of it. Cutting down forests that provide moisture to the air and cool the earth, so rain can fall. (This shows the extent of deforestation worldwide in red.) Using pesticides to kill the bacteria that helps create rain. Also stripping the earth of native plants upon which the bacteria can grow. Drying and heating the air in city areas with car exhaust and airborne pollutants from manufacturers. The rising heat pushes clouds away and the chemicals disburse whatever rain starts to form. Growing cattle and other meat-producing animals en masse, so their gastric emissions (burps, farts, and feces) produce quantities of greenhouse gas emissions that heat the air. This from Skeptical Science shows that 14-18% of the earth's human-induced greenhouse gas emissions come from livestock production.

A part of the water precipitating penetrates the ground and moves downward through the incisions, forming aquifers. Finally, a part of the surface and underground water leads to sea. During this trip, water is converted in all phases: gas, liquid, and solid. As mentioned above, water always changes states between liquid, vapor, and ice, with these processes happening in the blink of an eye and over millions of years.Figure 3.4. The hydrological cycle.Used under license from Shutterstock.com/Image ID:236708653.The hydrological cycle is intimately linked with changes in the atmospheric temperature and radiation balance. Warming of the climate system in recent decades is unequivocal, as it is now evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising of the sea level globally.It is expected that the hydrological cycle will be affected from global warming due to the enhanced greenhouse effect [10]. The hydrological cycle may be strengthened with more precipitation and more evaporation, but the extra precipitation will be unequally distributed around the globe. It is expected that some areas of the world may see significant reductions in precipitation or even more major variations in the timing of wet and dry seasons. Many aspects of the economy, environment, and society are dependent upon water resources, and changes in the hydrological resource base have the potential to severely impact upon environmental quality, economic development, and social well-being [11].URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444627339000034Poulomi Chakravarty, Manoj Kumar, in , 20196.5.1 Hydrological CycleThe hydrological cycle of the earth is the sum total of all processes in which water moves from the land and ocean surface to the atmosphere and back in form of precipitation. The hydrological cycle is dependent on various factors and is equally affected by oceans and land surfaces. In the case of the land surface, vegetation plays a vital role in the maintenance of the hydrologic budget (Pielke and Niyogi, 2009). The presence of vegetation increases the capacity of the land surface to retain moisture. Precipitation is then intercepted by plants and directly evaporated when captured by the canopy. The plants themselves transpire and aid in the creation of a major amount of water vapor through evapotranspiration processes. The surface runoff, in the case of bare ground, is much greater than in vegetated lands. As plants dominate the processes of energy, water vapor, and carbon exchange, their presence is critical to the functioning of the hydrological cycle.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128139127000065T.N.

Singh, in , 20216.2 Hydrological cycle and climate changeHydrological cycle, also known as water cycle, is a continuous movement of water between hydrosphere, atmosphere, and lithosphere in a cyclic manner (Fig. 6.1). Movement of water occurs from one reservoir to another through physical processes such as evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, and surface runoff. Earth’s surface is covered by 70% water which amounts to 1.4×1018 m3. Out of this, 97% reside in oceans as saline water and 3% constitute the fresh water sources such as rivers, lakes, glaciers, permanent snow and groundwater aquifers (Shiklomanov and Rodda, 2003; Green, 2016). The solar insolation causes evaporation to transfer approximately 577×1012 m3 of water from surface of the Earth to the atmosphere of which 86% is contributed by oceans and remaining 14% by land (Shiklomanov, 1993; Pimentel et al., 2004). Evaporated water from Earth’s surface reaches the atmosphere where it is condensed to form water droplets and subsequently it reaches the land in the form of precipitation (rain and snow) accounting for almost 20% of world’s precipitation. The surplus water, thus received on land, returns to oceans through rivers and groundwater thereby completing the water cycle (Shiklomanov, 1993; Pimentel et al., 2004). Therefore, solar energy moves a significant amount of water from oceans to land via atmosphere every year, thus making the hydrologic cycle vital not only to human life and natural ecosystem, but also to agricultural and industrial production.Figure 6.1. Hydrologic cycle showing the cyclic transfer of water between atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere.Modified from Trenberth, K.E., Jones, P.D., Ambenje, P., Bojariu, R., Easterling, D., Klein Tank, A., et al., 2007.

(Eds.), Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (UK), pp. 235–336.However, the hydrologic cycle has started to alter due to the adverse effects of climate change and rising global temperatures. The processes that are involved in the hydrologic cycle are highly dependent on temperature. It has been observed that global temperatures have steadily been rising over millions of years and directly influencing the precipitation patterns, monsoonal intensity, water vapor concentrations, cloud formation, seasonal changes and river flow patterns. The rising temperature and changing climate has partly intensified this cycle because rising global temperature evaporates more water from the ocean and land. The warm air holds more water vapor which in turn produces more intensified rainfall causing flooding of coastal regions. Warm air also increases rate of evaporation that intensifies the evaporative process on the land which causes soil moisture to evaporate over a time period and thus, intensifying the drought condition on the hinterland areas of the continent. Therefore, shifts in climatic patterns and rising global temperature speeds up the water cycle leading to changes in extreme climatic phenomenon of more intensified rainfall, cloud burst situations, frequent storms and drought conditions. This direct effect on hydrologic cycle will also lead to changes in water resources.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128202005000154John F. Shroder, in , 2014AbstractThe hydrological cycle in Afghanistan is one of the high altitude snow and rain, commonly torrential, which produces catastrophic downstream effects such as avalanches and floods. Most of the precipitation that drives the river-flow lifeblood of the country outward from the tops of the watersheds in Afghanistan diminishes toward the borders from its highs in the northeast of the nation. The main river systems, listed in a counterclockwise direction around Afghanistan. include the Amu Darya, Hari Rud–Murgab, Helmand–Arghandab, and the Kabul, each of which is discussed in more detail herein. Lakes in Afghanistan include glacial, landslide-dammed, carbonate-precipitate types, diastrophic (tectonic and volcanic) lakes, tectonic—mixed types, and multiple deflation-basin sorts of lakes, many of which are intermittently dry. Underground water in Afghanistan occurs in aquifer basins throughout the country, with the basin beneath Kabul City undergoing severe drawdown.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128001356000052J. Shroder, in , 2016AbstractThe hydrological cycle in Central and Southwest Asia, of course, operates essentially the same as it does in the rest of the world, but it does have regional variations in character and timing of its phases, energy sources, winds, distributions, climate and topographic influences, and other controlling factors that need to be understood. The high mountains of the region serve as the water-tower catchments for the elusive moisture that passes over the dry lowlands, but fortunately for the people who live there, that moisture precipitates orographically in the mountains above them. Not so fortunately, however, the common devegetation and soil erosion that also occur so commonly in the region, end up despoiling the surficial environments and reducing water infiltration into the surficial soils so that the runoff is accelerated into flashfloods and is thereby wasted. In any case, multiple drainage basins have resulted, the development and use of which are the focus of this book.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012801886600001XCarla S.S. Ferreira, ... Zahra Kalantari, in , 20222.1 Catchment characteristics determining hydrological processesThe hydrological cycle is generally defined as a conceptual model describing the storage and circulation of water between the biosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, and the hydrosphere.21 In open green areas, the soil water balance can be formulated as follows22:(1)ROi=RZWDi−RZWDi−1+Ri−ETi−DPiwhere ROi is runoff (mm), RZWDi and RZWDi-1 are root zone soil water depletion on days i and i-1, respectively, and Ri, ETi, and DPi (all in mm) are rainfall, crop evapotranspiration, and deep percolation, respectively, on day i.One major consequence of intensive urbanization is the expansion in sealed/paved surfaces, e.g., roads, buildings, and parking lots. These changes affect landscape dynamics and in particular water fluxes, leading to the disruption of natural hydrological processes. In urbanized areas, the hydrological cycle becomes more complex due to many anthropogenic influences and interventions, and is normally called the urban water cycle. Relative to the water cycle in natural areas, the most significant changes in physical aspects of hydrology in urban areas include: (i) removal of natural vegetation (trees, shrubs, herbaceous vegetation) in open areas and along the banks of streams and rivers; (ii) removal of local depressions that can temporarily store surface water; (iii) decreased soil infiltration capacity and consequently loss of water retention; (iv) increasing impervious areas (e.g., residential, industry, roads, airports); and (v) construction of artificial drainage systems (i.e., sewer network, pluvial network, open channels, culverted streams). Thus, even though the components of the hydrological cycle are the same, their effects in urban environments are quite different in the following regards: (i) reduced effects of vegetation in rainfall interception and evapotranspiration23; (ii) decreased water infiltration into the soil and thus reduced recharge of subsurface runoff and aquifers; (iii) decreased surface roughness, leading to increasing runoff volume and velocity, associated with increasing runoff energy and power for transport capacity and soil erosion24; and (iv) increasing peak flows and frequency of flash floods, with shorter time of concentration and reduced recession times25 (Fig. 1). These changes in the streamflow regime impact urban aquatic ecosystems, for example by reducing the physical size and productivity of the ecosystems.26Fig. 1. Schematic illustration of the impacts of urbanization on hydrograph shape.Adapted from Fletcher TD, Andrieu H, Hamel, P. Understanding, management and modelling of urban hydrology and its consequences for receiving waters: a state of the art. Adv Water Resour 2013;51:261–79.Typically, surface runoff increases with the percentage of impervious surface in a city. At the same time, deep percolation decreases relative to soil natural coverage, also in line with the extent of impervious surface, but to a higher percentage than the infiltration decreases. The decrease in evapotranspiration is not as large as those in infiltration and deep percolation, even with the loss of vegetation, because evaporation from sealed surfaces remains relatively high in the urban environment. The high rates of energy fluxes in cities, e.g., gaseous emissions from traffic, contribute to the urban heat island effect, characterized by higher air temperatures, and thus evaporation rates, in urban areas.27URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468928922000016Jan Henning L'Abée-Lund, ... Lars-Evan Pettersson, in , 200915.2.3 HydrologyThe hydrological cycle is influenced by several factors such as solar influx, rotation of the earth, distance from the ocean, topography, and general atmospheric circulation patterns. In the Boreal Uplands, topography and distance from the ocean vary considerably among watercourses. In general, the mean annual precipitation is highest in the west and north with values exceeding 4000 mm. In the east and in inland areas of large fjords, the mean annual precipitation is <1000 mm. The maximum and minimum mean annual precipitation during 1961–1990 was 6944 and 128 mm, respectively.Runoff is not evenly distributed throughout the year and can be divided into specific runoff regions (Gottschalk et al. 1979). In coastal areas, with a so-called Atlantic regime, the lowest runoff occurs during May–August and runoff is similar during the other months. The inland regime, situated between the Atlantic and the mountain regime, is characterized by low runoff in winter (January–March), a marked increase due to snow melt in April and May, and low values in summer that increase from August until winter begins. The geographical variation in precipitation is reflected in the flow regime of the rivers (Figure 15.2). In some rivers, the period of recording covers several years prior to and after development of hydropower schemes. Hydropower development has resulted in a significant reduction in the ratio between flood and minimum discharge.FIGURE 15.2. Flow dynamics of 10 selected boreal rivers. Name of gauging station and recording period are indicated.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123694492000151Carlos R. Mello, ... José M. Mello, in , 20232.2 Water balance in tropical forested watershedsThe hydrological cycle is the set of stages and processes that water is subject to in nature, encompassing different forms of precipitation, infiltration, recharge of aquifers, generation of surface runoff and evapotranspiration. Among these factors, the response of each phase of the water cycle is closely related to the different types of land use, especially in forest ecosystems (Rodrigues et al., 2021b). Due to the natural complexity of the hydrological cycle, it is necessary to deepen the knowledge of interactions between its phases, mainly the terrestrial phase.Soil water infiltration is one of the many processes of the hydrological cycle. Its spatial and temporal distributions are fundamental for understanding hydrological processes, such as the generation of direct surface runoff, recharge of aquifers (percolation), evapotranspiration and soil erosion processes (Mello et al., 2019). With respect to native forests, soil moisture and its fluctuations throughout time can promote significant changes in the structure and dynamics of forests. Vale et al. (2013) observed an increase in basal area due to the rapid growth of many trees in three dry forests in the Araguari River Basin, Brazil, after increasing soil moisture due to the construction of two dams in the surrounding area.Forest ecosystems have a direct relationship with the hydrological cycle, having a special effect on the redistribution of gross precipitation and the increase of water infiltration capability (Terra et al., 2018b). The rainfall interception takes place when the rainfall reaches the forest canopy. A portion is retained and then evaporates to the atmosphere, a further portion flows through the trunks (SF), and another portion passes freely through the canopy into the ground (TF) (Bialkowski and Buttle, 2015; Junqueira Junior et al., 2019). The set formed by the TF and the SF is known as net precipitation. In this sense, several studies have focused on the measurement and modeling of rainfall interception in forest environments. However, there is a lack of studies that address the variations in the hydrological cycle elements in different forest stands and analyze the idiosyncrasies of each case.The Brazilian Atlantic Forest is an endangered biome. After more than 500 years of degradation, this ecosystem, which occupied 100 million hectares, corresponding to 16% of the country's area, is currently restricted to forest patches mainly in the mountainous of Brazil’s South and Southeast regions and even so under anthropogenic pressure (Galindo-Leal and Câmara, 2003; Nehren et al., 2013; Oliveira Filho et al., 2006).The headwaters of Southeastern Brazil are areas whose geomorphological characteristics (soils, topography, and climate) indicate an environmental fragility, with shallow to moderately deep soils, steep topography and a heavy rain pattern, being susceptible to natural disasters (Alves et al., 2022; Beskow et al., 2011; Bruijnzeel et al., 2010; Mello et al., 2020; Nehren et al., 2019). According to Mello et al. (2019) and Menezes et al. (2009), such regions are extremely important from the hydrological point of view, whose water yield capacity is noted especially by the large number of important rivers that originate and drain from these areas.Menezes et al. (2009) evaluated the hydrological components of two watersheds in the “Serra da Mantiqueira” (Southeastern Brazil), occupied by extensive pasture, mature Atlantic Forest, and regenerating Atlantic Forest. The authors analyzed the streamflow in two conditions of land use during the dry period and found that water"

Reservoirs Water is stored in different parts of the water cycle anywhere from minutes to millennia. These natural reservoirs contain more than 330 million cubic miles (mi3), or 1.4 billion cubic kilometers (km3), a small portion of which touches every life on Earth every day. (One cubic mile (mi3) is equal to more than 1 trillion gallons. On cubic kilometer (km3) is exactly 1 trillion liters.) Ocean: The ocean contains 97 percent of Earth's known water supply, or 0.32 billion mi3 (1.335 billion km3). Because of its size, the ocean accounts for most of the planet's evaporation and precipitation and also helps transport heat, nutrients, and other materials around the globe. Atmosphere: The atmosphere holds merely 0.001 percent, or 3.05 mi3 (12.7 km3), of Earth's water. Much of this remains in the atmosphere for only a few days on average, but this reservoir is the primary means of moving water great distances, particularly far inland. Cryosphere: The frozen places on Earth, in particular ice in Antarctica and Greenland, account for 2 percent, or 6.1 million mi3 (25.5 million km3), of water and about two-thirds of fresh water. Many people rely on runoff from mountain glaciers and snowfields for their water supply. Land: Water on and beneath the land (surface- and groundwater) account for just one percent, or 3.7 mi3 (15.55 km3), of Earth's water. This crucial source makes up the majority of what is known as ""available water""—water that can be easily tapped for human use. Lithosphere: Earth's crust and mantle, contains a vast, but unknown amount of water. This takes two forms: ""free"" water in cracks and pores, and chemically bound water—hydrated minerals formed in the presence of water and that contain hydrogen and oxygen. Flows Water is the only natural substance that can exist as a solid, liquid, or gas under everyday conditions. It is also the ""universal solvent,"" capable of dissolving more substances than any other liquid. Water's ability to take many forms and to transport other materials, including heat, is a key reason why life exists on Earth. (One Sverdrup (Sv) is a flow rate of 1 million cubic meters, or 264 million gallons, per second. Currents & Circulation: Winds create surface currents, such as the Gulf Stream which ranges from 30 to 150 Sv. Differences in ocean temperature and salinity also drive thermohaline circulation (the ocean conveyor), parts of which are estimated to be more than 50 Sv. Ocean evaporation: Evaporation over the ocean is 85 percent of the global total, more than 3 times what occurs over land and equivalent to between 11.7 and 14.3 Sv. Ocean precipitation: More than three-quarters of global precipitation occurs over the ocean, a flow of water equal to between 10 and 13.4 Sv. Evapotranspiration: Evapotranspiration combines evaporation (liquid water changing to vapor) and transpiration (water released by plants). Evapotranspiration over land totals about 2.5 Sv, or 15 percent of the water entering the atmosphere from Earth's surface. Land precipitation: Less than one-quarter of global precipitation occurs over land, a flow of water from the atmosphere equal to about 3.5 Sv. Sublimation: Under certain conditions, water can change directly from a solid (snow and ice) into a gas (water vapor) without melting, a process known as sublimation. Wind transport: Winds move water vapor and heat energy long distances across the face of Earth in a relatively short period of time. Groundwater: Water flowing from the surface of the land into the ground forms groundwater, one of the most important, and least renewable, water resources on Earth. Some deep aquifers hold water for tens of thousands of years. Human use: Agriculture currently accounts for 70 percent of water"

Some of the precipitation soaks into the ground. Some of the underground water is trapped between rock or clay layers - this is called groundwater. But most of the water flows downhill as runoff (above ground or underground), eventually returning to the seas as slightly salty water. This Information page provides an understanding of the hydrological cycle. It describes the principal stages of the cycle, with a brief description of each stage. A diagram gives a clear visual explanation. The links between the hydrological cycle and the duties of a water utility to supply clean water and dispose of dirty water are also explained. Links to other web pages allow the reader (particularly teachers and students) to supplement the information contained in this Information Note. Where is all the Earth’s water? Water is the most widespread substance to be found in the natural environment and it is the source of all life on earth. Water covers 70% of the earth’s surface but it is difficult to comprehend the total amount of water when we only see a small portion of it. The distribution of water throughout the earth is not uniform. Some places have far more rainfall than others. There are many reasons for this, such as where the mountains are and where the prevailing winds blow. This rainfall distribution partly explains the differences in vegetation and why some areas are deserts and some are rainforests. Water exists in three states: liquid, solid and invisible vapour. It forms the oceans, seas, lakes, rivers and the underground waters found in the top layers of the earth’s crust and soil cover. In a solid state, it exists as ice and snow cover in polar and alpine regions. A certain amount of water is contained in the air as water vapour, water droplets and ice crystals, as well as in the biosphere. Huge amounts of water are bound up in the composition of the different minerals of the earth’s crust and core. To assess the total water storage on the earth reliably is a complicated problem because water is so very dynamic. It is in permanent motion, constantly changing from liquid to solid or gaseous phase, and back again. The quantity of water found in the hydrosphere is the usual way of estimating the earth’s water. This is all the free water existing in liquid, solid or gaseous state in the atmosphere, on the Earth’s surface and in the crust down to a depth of 2000 metres. Current estimates are that the earth’s hydrosphere contains a huge amount of water - about 1386 million cubic kilometres. However, 97.5% of this amount exists as saline waters and only 2.5% as fresh water. The greatest portion of the fresh water (68.7%) is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Antarctic, the Arctic and in the mountainous regions. 29.9% exists as fresh groundwaters. Only 0.26% of the total amount of fresh water on the earth is concentrated in lakes, reservoirs and river system, where it is most easily accessible for our economic needs and absolutely vital for water ecosystems. The values for stored water given above are for natural, static, water storage in the hydrosphere. It is the amount of water contained simultaneously, on average, over a long period of time, – in water bodies, aquifers and the atmosphere. For shorter time intervals such as a single year, a couple of seasons or a few months, the volume of water stored in the hydrosphere will vary as water exchanges take place between the oceans, land and the atmosphere. What is the Hydrological Cycle? The total amount of water on the earth and in its atmosphere does not change but the earth’s water is always in movement. Oceans, rivers, clouds and rain, all of which contain water, are in a frequent state of change and the motion of rain and flowing rivers transfers water in a never-ending cycle. This circulation and conservation of earth’s water as it circulates from the land to the sky and back again is called the ‘hydrological cycle’ or ‘water cycle’. How does the Hydrological Cycle work? The stages of the cycle are: Evaporation Transport Condensation Precipitation Groundwater Run-off Evaporation Water is transferred from the surface to the atmosphere through evaporation, the process by which water changes from a liquid to a gas. The sun’s heat provides energy to evaporate water from the earth’s surface. Land, lakes, rivers and oceans send up a steady stream of water vapour and plants also lose water to the air (transpiration). Approximately 80% of all evaporation is from the oceans, with the remaining 20% coming from inland water and vegetation. Transport The movement of water through the atmosphere, specifically from over the oceans to over land, is called transport. Some of the earth’s moisture transport is visible as clouds, which themselves consist of ice crystals and/or tiny water droplets. Clouds are propelled from one place to another by either the jet stream, surface-based circulations like land and sea breezes or other mechanisms. However, a typical cloud 1 km thick contains only enough water for a millimetre of rainfall, whereas the amount of moisture in the atmosphere is usually 10-50 times greater than this. Most water is transported in the form of water vapour, which is actually the third most abundant gas in the atmosphere. Water vapour may be invisible to us, but not to satellites which are capable of collecting data about moisture patterns in the atmosphere. Condensation The transported water vapour eventually condenses, forming tiny droplets in clouds. Precipitation The primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere to the surface of the earth is precipitation. When the clouds meet cool air over land, precipitation, in the form of rain, sleet or snow, is triggered and water returns to the land (or sea). A proportion of atmospheric precipitation evaporates. Groundwater Some of the precipitation soaks into the ground and this is the main source of the formation of the waters found on land - rivers, lakes, groundwater and glaciers. Some of the underground water is trapped between rock or clay layers - this is called groundwater. Water that infiltrates the soil flows downward until it encounters impermeable rock and then travels laterally. The locations where water moves laterally are called ‘aquifers’. Groundwater returns to the surface through these aquifers, which empty into lakes, rivers and the oceans. Under special circumstances, groundwater can even flow upward in artesian wells. The flow of groundwater is much slower than run-off with speeds usually measured in centimetres per day, metres per year or even centimetres per year. Run-off Most of the water which returns to land flows downhill as run-off. Some of it penetrates and charges groundwater while the rest, as river flow, returns to the oceans where it evaporates. As the amount of groundwater increases or decreases, the water table rises or falls accordingly. When the entire area below the ground is saturated, flooding occurs because all subsequent precipitation is forced to remain on the surface. Different surfaces hold different amounts of water and absorb water at different rates. As a surface becomes less permeable, an increasing amount of water remains on the surface, creating a greater potential for flooding. Flooding is very common during winter and early spring because frozen ground has no permeability, causing most rainwater and meltwater to become run-off. This entire process repeats as illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1.The stages of the Hydrological Cycle. Diagram from Max Planck Institute for Meteorology A Water Balance A considerable portion of river flow does not reach the ocean, having evaporated those areas with no natural surface run-off channels. On the other hand, some groundwater bypasses river systems altogether and goes directly to the ocean or evaporates. Every year, the turnover of water on Earth involves 577,000 km3 of water. This is water that evaporates from the ocean surface (502,800 km3) and from land (74,200 km3). The same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation, 458,000 km3 on the ocean and 119,000 km3 on land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface (119,000 ?– ?74,200 = 44,800 km3/year) represents the total run-off of the Earth’s rivers (42,700 km3/year) and direct groundwater run-off. More information on the volumes of global water and freshwater can be found at: How does Water Supply and Sewage Disposal fit into the Hydrological Cycle? We have seen that water flows into rivers, lakes and into groundwater storage. Most importantly, for our daily water needs, it also flows into our homes and taps. A network of underground pipes, pumping stations and treatment works ensures that clean, fresh drinking water is delivered by our local water utility to our homes every day of the week. After water has been used, the water utility collects, transports and then cleans this dirty water and returns it safely back into rivers where it can continue its journey downstream to the sea. The water utility’s responsibility begins at the precipitation stage of the hydrological cycle. Utilities in some water-scarce countries encourage the collection of rainwater from rooftops (rainwater harvesting) but in most of Europe the hydrological cycle begins with surface waters. Figure 2 illustrates the water utility’s role in the hydrological cycle. Figure 2.The Water Utility’s Role in the Hydrological (Water) Cycle. Reference UK Drinking Water Inspectorate website() Surface Waters Rainwater takes the quickest route to the sea and flows into rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers. The water in the surface waters is clean enough to support a variety of wildlife, but it is not safe to drink and needs to be treated in a water treatment works to remove any harmful substances. Water Treatment Works see also Information Note . Water is abstracted from underground sources via boreholes or alternatively is pumped from rivers and stored in reservoirs before being passed through sand filter beds which trap any dirt and organisms. It is then treated using the most up to date advanced water treatment (AWT) technology such as ozonation and carbon filtration (granular activated carbon) which remove the substances that we cannot see. (Note however that a large proportion of groundwater receives chlorination only and many surface water sources do not need AWT and use only coagulation/sedimentation/filtration.) Water Distribution Clean, fresh drinking water is pumped into an underground network of pipes and storage reservoirs and is not seen again until it reaches your tap. This guarantees that the water you drink remains clean and fresh. Water Use On average, in European countries, each person uses around 150 litres (33 gallons) of water every day. Baths, showers, washing up, washing clothes and toilet flushing all use large amounts of water. These activities transform clean tap water into dirty wastewater. The water utility not only supplies clean drinking water but also collects, transports and disposes of the dirty water after it has been used. Sewerage Dirty water or sewage is collected firstly in drains and then in underground sewers and is transported via a sewerage system (a network of pipes and tunnels) to a sewage treatment works. Sewage Treatment Works see also Information Note . These works use natural micro-organisms to remove harmful substances from dirty water. The solid material (sludge) is separated from the liquid (effluent) and both are treated to produce clean effluent that can be released back to the river and bio-solids that can be used in agriculture as a fertiliser or incinerated to produce energy. Use as a fertiliser completes nutrient cycles and replenishes soil organic matter and sequestered carbon. The majority of sludge is treated by anaerobic digestion (AD), which produces biogas renewable energy. Completing the Cycle The river continues its journey back to the sea where the cycle starts again. Water evaporates to form clouds, condenses to droplets and eventually falls as rain on to the ground. Activities for Schools Thames Water website for schools – water"
0,e-education.psu,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://www.e-education.psu.edu/eme807/node/636,"water is contained in surface reservoirs - rivers, lakes, wetlands, and streams. [Girard, 2013]. Although sustaining life is one of the main key purposes of the water, present-day agriculture and many industry branches heavily rely on the abundance of the water resource. For example, water is used as heat transport fluid in thermoelectric energy systems, such as nuclear and fossil fuel fired power plants and concentrating solar power farms. It is used as solvent and raw material in chemical manufacturing. Mining industry utilizes significant amount of water in hydraulic fracturing and oil recovery. Those industries are important parts of modern infrastructure; hence, the water demand must be met to keep the power and food production at the necessary level. To plan sustainable utilization of water resources, we must understand how the water cycle works at the global and local scales. The amount of water on earth is finite, and the natural water cycle is a system that controls the circulation and redistribution of that resource. You must be familiar with the water cycle concept from your early science classes. But you can get a refresher from the following short video: Video: Water Cycle | How the Hydrologic Cycle Works (6:46) Credit: . ""."" YouTube. July 12, 2013. Click here for a transcript of the Water Cycle | How the Hydrologic Cycle Works video. PRESENTER: All the water on Earth today, every drop, is all the water there has ever been on the planet. Fresh water is actually, millions of years old. The same water flowing in a continuous loop. Falling as rain and snow from clouds to the Earth's surface. Running in rivers. Pooling in ponds. Flowing from faucets. Irrigating crops. Traveling through plants. Generating power. Eventually, evaporating into the air and condensing into clouds, again. ANNA MICHALAK: Why is there life on Earth? And the reason there is life on Earth is because Earth has this perfect water cycle. PRESENTER: The water cycle, so simple even small children understand the basics. Yet, so complex, the most advanced Earth scientists-- hydrologists, geologists, and biogeochemists-- are studying every part and process. MARTHA CONKLIN: The water cycle is fascinating. It's something that's around us all the time. And yet, we don't really understand it. PRESENTER: How to summarize what is known about the water cycle? With two words-- flows and stores. The water cycle is a series of flows of water between various water stores, or storages-- clouds in the atmosphere. TOM HARMON: There's always a little bit of water in the atmosphere. We talk about relative humidity. It's a humid day. It's a dry day. Either way, there's water-- sometimes, a little. Sometimes, a lot. PRESENTER: There's a lot of water in the ocean-- 70% of all the water on Earth. In the ice sheets and glaciers, 2/3 of all the freshwater on Earth. In the snow packs atop mountains like the Sierra Nevada. In the Great Lakes. In rivers and streams. In reservoirs and watersheds. In wetlands. In the soil. In and on plants and trees rooted in the soil. And beneath the soil, in water tables and underground aquifers like the Ogallala-High Plains, which runs underneath parts of eight states, from South Dakota to Texas. All this storage is temporary. Water in all its forms is always in flux and always moving. And there is a name for every kind of movement in the water cycle, starting with precipitation. ANNA MICHALAK: Precipitation is the process of water falling onto the surface of the Earth. You could have precipitation in many forms-- rain, snow, hail. PRESENTER: Rain is falling water in liquid form. Snow, ice, hail, and sleet are falling water in solid or frozen form. Fog and mist, falling water in gas or vapor form. Precipitation that falls directly onto the oceans becomes part of Surface Ocean and can be churned by wave and wind action into ocean currents. Rain and snow that falls directly on rivers and streams becomes one part of stream flow. Rain that falls onto land takes a different path to the river. As does the snow and ice that falls and collects on mountain tops when temperatures warm. MARTHA CONKLIN: When snow melts, some of it runs through the snow pack and goes into small streams, tributaries that feed into large rivers. PRESENTER: What about that precipitation that falls on and over land? Some is intercepted by vegetation-- plants and trees. TOM HARMON: Like you might imagine, someone in the game of football intercepting a pass, these are raindrops trying to come to the ground and the leaves on the tree intercept them before they hit the ground. PRESENTER: And the precipitation that does hit the ground, it can run off if the ground is hardscape, covered with asphalt or concrete, or if the soil is too wet or saturated to absorb more water, like an over-soaked sponge. Otherwise, precipitation infiltrates the soil surface, percolates into the ground. TOM HARMON: Think of it as the water percolating through your coffee grounds in the morning. Gravity continues to pull it downwards so it will move through. PRESENTER: Through the topsoil. Into spaces between soil and rock particles. Down to bedrock and further into fractures. Into deep underground aquifers. Even ground water here is moving sideways or laterally, discharging toward a river, lake, or the sea. Generally, the deeper the flow, the slower the flow. MARTHA CONKLIN: Some of that fractured water might take a very long time-- thousands to millions of years-- to get out. PRESENTER: And how does water get back out into the atmosphere? It evaporates. It's turned from a liquid into a gas or vapor, by the heat of the sun. ANNA MICHALAK: If you put a bit of water into a bowl and you set it outside on a sunny day, it's going to disappear. It's still water, it's just in the form of a gas rather than the form of a liquid. PRESENTER: Water evaporates from every wet surface, even from wet air. Some rain and snow evaporates into the air while falling. Water evaporates through our respiration and perspiration. And from plants through transpiration. Trans means through or across. Plant roots draw up groundwater. And plants pull that water up through their stems into the leaves and then, release them back out through evapotranspiration. Evapotranspiration-- a spelling bee worthy term for evaporation from soil and water surfaces, plus transpiration from plants. Evaporated water molecules are tiny enough to flow into the air. Mix with smoke and dirt particles in the atmosphere. Cool. Condense into visible masses of water vapor-- clouds. Winds move clouds into colder air, water droplets collide and merge, grow bigger and heavier until they are so heavy, they fall again, as rain or snow, sleet or hail. Precipitation, collection, runoff, interception, infiltration, percolation, discharge, transpiration, evaporation, condensation-- the water cycle This quite general and deceivingly simple concept of water cycle has a number of limitations which are important to understand: Capacities of the reservoirs vary dramatically. Flow rates between the reservoirs vary dramatically (for example replenishment of a surface stream via precipitation can take days, while replenishment of a deep aquifer may take decades). This concept does not directly reflect possible delays or discontinuities. Cycle kinetics depends on climate, time of the year, and geographic location. This concept does not portray fluctuations in storage zones. Check out this website! To add some quantitative information to the picture, please take a look at the website. If you scroll down and click on any of the components of the water cycle, you will get comprehensive information on that reservoir. Note the dramatic difference in water capacity of different reservoirs. Try to remember at least the order of magnitude of the specific water reserves, since such quantitative perception can be quite useful in sustainability analysis. Annual evaporation from the ocean is about 80,000 cubic miles versus 15,000 cubic miles from the land. Given the amounts of water evaporated and precipitated are almost equal, the total amount of water exchanged between the atmosphere and the earth surface is about 95,000 cubic miles. Out of the water evaporated and then returned by rainstorms, 24,000 cubic miles fall on land as precipitation. The average annual precipitation over the land is 26 inches, but it is not evenly distributed. Arid locations may get under 1 inch of precipitation, whereas some others can get more than 400 inches. The total annual precipitation in the United States is about 30 inches per year, which accounts for about 4300 billion gallons per day. The total water flow from surface and subsurface sources is about 8.5 inches per year, i.e., about 1200 billion gallons a day. This amount is available for human use, including domestic, industrial, agricultural, and recreational use. Considering that the difference between precipitation and stream flow is -21.5 inches per year (3100 billion gallons per day), this amount is assumed to return to the atmosphere (through evaporation and transpiration). This returned volume roughly accounts for 70 % of the total water supply. [Source: , 2001] In nature, the hydrological cycle is well-balanced, and fluctuations of environmental water stocks are reversible. But when some of the parts of the system are interfered, resilience of the system may be jeopardized. This can happen when the anthropogenic water consumption cycle is plugged in to the natural water cycle. The main troubles currently experienced because of mismatch of the anthropogenic and natural cycles include: groundwater depletion; chemical pollution of surface waters and groundwaters; lake drying; droughts; desertification; eutrophication loss of habitat water and food shortages. While the above-listed factors may have acute local effect, recent research also shows that large-scale hydraulic engineering produces global-scale impact on the earth's water cycle, raising the global sea level. Reading Assignment: Read through the following article that discusses the main man-made factors that affect the natural hydrological balance. While you are welcome to read the whole article, put the main focus on Table 1, which quantifies those effects, and sections on ""Major classes of water engineering"" and ""Impacts of Human control..."", which explain the specific mechanisms within the cycle. Journal article: Vorosmarty, C.J., Sahagian, D., Anthropogenic Disturbance of the Terrestrial Water Cycle, BioScience, vol. 50, pp.753-763. (Full article can be accessed via Library e-Reserves in Canvas.) Some of the things to reflect on in this reading: Water management is closely dependent on soil management: overuse of soil, deforestation increase storm water runoff, decreasing absorption to soil and hence decreasing the continental water storage. Water does not have a chance to return to aquifers. While no net losses occur in the water cycle (""closed"" system), loss of continental (fresh) water from continents to the ocean (salt water), results in shrinking of the usable water reservoirs - e.g., depletion of aquifers. Irrigation accounts for over 80% of all 'irretrievable' water consumption. This constitutes ~56% of all water withdrawn from the natural sources in some areas. Loss of water during irrigation is due to intense evaporation and plant uptake. Large artificial reservoirs (dammed rivers) have high evaporation rates (compared to unmodified rivers) and therefore can reduce the continental runoff. At the same time, they cause water transfer to the atmosphere and to the groundwater storage. The idea of sustainability in water management implies matching the natural water cycle and technical (anthropogenic) water use cycle together with minimal damage and maximum mutual support. A new approach to integrated managing water resources is known as total water cycle management, where water supply, stormwater, and wastewater are all considered during the design process. The diagram in Figure 6.1. presents the water cycle in terms of stocks and flows. It illustrates the connections between different natural processes and reservoirs and also introduces the anthropogenic water paths into the system. The diagram is quite busy, so it would be useful to walk through it step by step. The video embedded below provides commentary to different parts of the diagram and also shows the links where water-treatment technologies must be applied to provide compatibility between the environmental and anthropogenic spheres.

This animation shows multiple connections within the hydrological cycle, including those with human controlled systems. It gets kinda bulky in the end so I will go step-by-step. Let's start with ocean. The ocean is the biggest reservoir on the Earth, which accounts for about 96.5% of global water reserve. The ocean exchanges water with the atmosphere. Through evaporation and precipitation. Atmospheric water vapor accounts for only 1000th of a percent of the global water. But because the surface of the evaporating ocean is so huge, they exchange is extremely important as transport mechanism. Now, let me push this ocean box to the side and clear up space for some other storages and elements of the cycle. We can identify a few main types of continental water storages. Surface water, rivers and streams, lakes, and some snow and ice masses. Snow and ice, by the way, represent quite a significant storage. They contain more water than all other service storage is altogether. Although storages are fed by the precipitation fluxes, rainfall or snow fall, and they also release some water back to the atmosphere. Snow eventually can melt and feed some water to the surface freshwater system. Then surface water flows to the streams and rivers through collection and surface runoff and reverse channel water to the more stationary storage lake or flow directly to the ocean. This is quite well-known schema of natural water exchange, which you may have heard in basic earth science class. But let's go a little bit further and add some more details here. Some of the rain can be intercepted by plants and that water eventually drips and flows down over with some delay. Plants also release some water to the atmosphere through transpiration and evaporation. Okay, The next step is very important. Considerable amount of surface water infiltrates into the soil from where it can be taken by plants. This process fosters biomass production. The rest of it percolates down to the groundwater and groundwater can actually migrate and exchange with the surface water storage is through the base flow. Groundwater is another huge reservoir, which may contain either fresh or salty water. Some of the aquifers may have connections to juvenile resources. In other words, the origin of this water can be related to the magmatic processes in the interior. So we put that into the picture. The next link, some of the groundwater in juvenile water reacts with rocks and is present in the mineralized form. For example hydrated minerals. And finally, here we have the geothermal water, which can be connected to both juvenile water pricing or dehydration of minerals on the high temperature and pressure. In some spots, geothermal water can just charge to the surface or to the ocean floor. This closes the loop from the downside. So this is the natural water cycle without humans in the picture. But what if we put our water utilization system right in the middle here? That includes agricultural, domestic, and industrial use of water. And those can be connected to an artificial water storage. So where does that usable water come from? Can be extracted from the aquifers or taken directly from the surface reservoirs, for example agriculture can use some diverted streams for irrigation. All those users produce some wastewater for sure and that wastewater can be treated and returned to the environment. Can be either discharged to streams or sprayed onto soils, or even can be re-inject it to the aquifers. Some of the treated wastewater can be re-used, which makes it closed recycling loop here. Agricultural irrigation is another way for the water to return to the natural cycle. Now we understand that rain can fall on the human-made environment as well. And after this indirection, we have some stormwater produced. This storm water is also considered some kind of wastewater which can be treated or not treated depending on the locality. But either way, storm water contributes to the discharge flux from the human water utilization system to the nature. Then we add another discharge curve here, showing that some of the wastewater sometimes goes back to the environment without any treatment. This is not good, but it happens. Can we extract water from other resources if groundwater is not available? Sure. Here we put the additional arrows to show extraction of water from rivers and lakes and exchange fluxes with the ocean certainly also take place. Some locations direct circulation of geothermal water. There's also a viable option. People can use it for heating the homeschool, for example. I'm sure this schematic can be developed further and more storages and fluxes can be identified. But let's stop here. You see this boundary zone here between the naturally balanced part of the cycle and human control part of the cycle is where the potential problems occur. Mismatch in physical and chemical fluxes can throw the system off balance and lead to water shortages, ecological crisis, pollution, and all other negative consequences. So to ensure global and local sustainability of water resources, we need a number of special technologies that would help make these two systems more compatible. Some technologies are used at the extraction phase, for example drinking water purification. Those make sure the water is sufficient and safe for human consumption. Other technologies are used at the discharge path. for example wastewater treatment. Those are designed to mitigate pollution and make sure that we're not depleting our natural reservoirs too soon. Finally, some technologies help control water loops within the human domain, for example water distribution and collection. The bottom line of this demonstration is that the development of novel technologies for water treatment and monitoring is very important for providing smooth interaction between the sphere of human activity and the environment. The ultimate sustainability goal here is to re-install the water balance locally and globally. And to be sure that this most important and irreplaceable resource is conserved for centuries to come. As you can see in the diagram in Figure 6.1, the boundaries between the natural and human-controlled water systems are where the sustainable water treatment technologies should come into action. The bottom line is that the role sustainable water technology is to reconcile the natural and anthropogenic cycles and to alleviate mutual harm and system misbalance. The following list gives you some examples of possible actions that help to keep combined water system sustainable (can vary with location): Water regime management keep the aquifer levels within appropriate range prevent flood damage in developed areas prevent excessive erosion Water quality minimize the export of pollutants to surface water or groundwater minimize waterborne sediment loading minimize pollution from sewage protect existing vegetation Water conservation control water extraction and use promote the use of rainwater and stormwater where such use does not adversely affect existing environmental values promote the reuse of wastewater effluent reduce irrigation requirements promote opportunities for localized supply Water value enhance water"

Timing 45-60 minutes Setting the Stage The water cycle (or hydrological cycle) describes the continuous movement of water on Earth. The warming of water from the Sun causes the evaporation of liquid water molecules into water vapour that moves up into the atmosphere. As water vapour moves higher in the atmosphere temperatures start to decrease, causing the vapour to condense and form liquid water droplets. When these droplets get heavy, they drop to Earth as a form of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet or hail). In conducting this inquiry, students use their observation skills to note examples of the various states of water in their environment. The students use this information to help them design and create their own miniature model of the water cycle using simple materials as a way to demonstrate their understanding of this natural process. This inquiry could begin from: Questions or comments initiated by the students about how water comes in different forms and how that affects life on Earth. Discuss using questions such as: “Where do you think rain/snow come from?” “If I wanted to find liquid water in our community/environment, where would I look? Where might I find water in other forms?” (e.g., liquid water: puddle, river, lake, ocean, ponds, streams, water table, dew, rain barrel, sprinkler, water fountain; solid water: snow, ice, skating rink, icicles, frost; gaseous water (water vapour): fog, mist, steam, breath on a cold day) “How do different forms of water affect our daily lives?” (e.g., choice of clothing and footwear, outside activities, road conditions, safety considerations, water conservation issues) The water cycle (Source: Benutzer:Joooo-derivative work: moyogo (talk) -derivative work: Alexchris [CC BY-SA 3.0] via ). An exploration walk outside in the school yard, local neighbourhood or nearby park to identify evidence of water in the environment. Discuss using questions such as: “Where could we look for water in this outside area?” “If you wanted to find water in our community, where might you find it?”(e.g., natural: puddle, river, lake, ocean, pond, stream, water table; human-made: bird bath, water fountain, sprinkler, swimming pool, well, sewers, water-supply system, reservoir, water tower) “At [this time of year], in what forms do we see water in the environment?” (e.g., solid – visible as ice, snow, sleet, hail, frost; liquid – visible as rain, mist and dew; gas – visible as fog and steam) Walking in a puddle (Source: via ). Icicles (Source: via ). Misty autumn lake and hillside (Source: via ). Reading a book such as by Miranda Paul or by Neil Waldman.

Co-constructed Learning Students: Saying, Doing, Representing Educator: Responding, Challenging Students demonstrate their ability to recognize water in the environment. “What different forms (states) can water take?” “What are some of the names that we give to the different forms (states) of water?” (e.g., ice, mist, fog, running water, rain, snow, hail, sleet, steam) “How does water get from one state to another?” “When and where have you seen water in the environment in a different state?” (e.g., in winter there is snow and ice; foggy mornings; dew on the grass in the evenings or early morning) Students collaborate to assemble and explore a model water cycle. “How can you help your group assemble the model?” “What tasks can be shared and what tasks are better done by one person at a time?” “Why is it important to work together when handling your model?” Students record their observations of the model water cycle, using a recording method of their choice. “How might you record your observations of the water cycle?” “What forms of precipitation can be involved in the water cycle?” “How will you organize and represent your observations of the water cycle so that it is very easy to understand?” “What technology could you use to record your observations?” Students use appropriate and accurate scientific language to communicate their understanding of the water cycle (use/apply prior knowledge and new learning) as a continuous process with unique stages. “Why is the process you observed called a cycle?” “How does the Sun activate the water cycle?” “How would you summarize the steps of the water cycle using correct scientific terms?” (e.g., evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection, runoff) “What could you do to help someone understand the water cycle?” “How do weather conditions impact the water cycle?” “How does water move around once it is on the ground?” Cross-curricular Connections Literacy Create a variety of media texts for different purposes (e.g., use their water cycle model to explain the water cycle) Understand the criteria involved in successfully completing a task (e.g., take on a role in a group that helps the group to be successful in completing their model of the water cycle) Mathematical Thinking Measure and record measurements using appropriate standard units (e.g., measure in ml the amount of water added to the model and what is left at the end of the exploration; measure the temperature of the water in degrees Celsius at the beginning and at the end of the exploration; measure the time it takes for condensation to form inside the model) Drama Use the elements and conventions of drama to communicate feelings, ideas, and stories (e.g., role-play changes that occur to a molecule of water in the water cycle: molecules of water warm up from the Sun; as they warm up they move faster and faster until they change into a gas (water vapour); water vapour moves up in the atmosphere to form clouds, where it cools down and condenses to become liquid water (precipitation), which falls to the ground and flows into puddles, streams, rivers or lakes and collects) Extending the Learning If your students are interested in learning more, the following may provoke their curiosity: Read a book such as by Karen Hess and explore extreme events that can occur in a water cycle. Discuss using questions such as: “Can you predict why it has not rained for such a long time in Come On, Rain?” “How do weather forecasters know that rain is coming or not coming? What kinds of technology do meteorologists use to make forecasts?” “What impacts of a lack of rain can you see in the story? What impacts of too much rain can you see in the story? “How does the lack of rain change the environment? How does flooding change the environment?

Co-constructed Learning Students: Saying, Doing, Representing Educator: Responding, Challenging Students demonstrate their ability to recognize water in the environment. “What different forms (states) can water take?” “What are some of the names that we give to the different forms (states) of water?” (e.g., ice, mist, fog, running water, rain, snow, hail, sleet, steam) “How does water get from one state to another?” “When and where have you seen water in the environment in a different state?” (e.g., in winter there is snow and ice; foggy mornings; dew on the grass in the evenings or early morning) Students collaborate to assemble and explore a model water cycle. “How can you help your group assemble the model?” “What tasks can be shared and what tasks are better done by one person at a time?” “Why is it important to work together when handling your model?” Students record their observations of the model water cycle, using a recording method of their choice. “How might you record your observations of the water cycle?” “What forms of precipitation can be involved in the water cycle?” “How will you organize and represent your observations of the water cycle so that it is very easy to understand?” “What technology could you use to record your observations?” Students use appropriate and accurate scientific language to communicate their understanding of the water cycle (use/apply prior knowledge and new learning) as a continuous process with unique stages. “Why is the process you observed called a cycle?” “How does the Sun activate the water cycle?” “How would you summarize the steps of the water cycle using correct scientific terms?” (e.g., evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection, runoff) “What could you do to help someone understand the water cycle?” “How do weather conditions impact the water cycle?” “How does water move around once it is on the ground?” Cross-curricular Connections Literacy Create a variety of media texts for different purposes (e.g., use their water cycle model to explain the water cycle) Understand the criteria involved in successfully completing a task (e.g., take on a role in a group that helps the group to be successful in completing their model of the water cycle) Mathematical Thinking Measure and record measurements using appropriate standard units (e.g., measure in ml the amount of water added to the model and what is left at the end of the exploration; measure the temperature of the water in degrees Celsius at the beginning and at the end of the exploration; measure the time it takes for condensation to form inside the model) Drama Use the elements and conventions of drama to communicate feelings, ideas, and stories (e.g., role-play changes that occur to a molecule of water in the water cycle: molecules of water warm up from the Sun; as they warm up they move faster and faster until they change into a gas (water vapour); water vapour moves up in the atmosphere to form clouds, where it cools down and condenses to become liquid water (precipitation), which falls to the ground and flows into puddles, streams, rivers or lakes and collects) Extending the Learning If your students are interested in learning more, the following may provoke their curiosity: Read a book such as by Karen Hess and explore extreme events that can occur in a water cycle. Discuss using questions such as: “Can you predict why it has not rained for such a long time in Come On, Rain?” “How do weather forecasters know that rain is coming or not coming? What kinds of technology do meteorologists use to make forecasts?” “What impacts of a lack of rain can you see in the story? What impacts of too much rain can you see in the story? “How does the lack of rain change the environment? How does flooding change the environment? How does it change the feelings and attitudes of the people?” “How does rain usually make you feel? When might your feelings about rain be different or change?” Cover image from Come on, Rain! by Karen Hess (Image via ) Explore an , such as this one developed by the US Geological Survey. This page also includes an Intermediate level water cycle with added information. Discuss using questions such as: “Where are some different places on Earth that water can collect? How does water move around on the ground?” “What did you learn about the different forms of precipitation?” “What causes condensation to happen in the water cycle?"" Interactive online water"

It occurs when heat energy from the sun causes water from oceans, lakes, rivers, and other surfaces to turn into water vapor and rise into the atmosphere.Condensation: When water vapor in the atmosphere cools down, it undergoes condensation and changes back into liquid water. This process forms clouds, which are made up of tiny water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air.Precipitation: Precipitation refers to the process in which condensed water vapor in the atmosphere falls back to the Earth's surface. It includes various forms of water reaching the ground, such as rain, snow, sleet, or hail.Runoff: When precipitation reaches the Earth's surface, it may flow over the land as runoff. Runoff collects in streams, rivers, and eventually makes its way to lakes, oceans, or groundwater reservoirs. It plays a crucial role in replenishing water bodies and maintaining the water cycle.Infiltration: Infiltration occurs when water from precipitation or runoff seeps into the ground and is absorbed by the soil. It replenishes groundwater reservoirs and becomes available for plants, animals, and human use.Transpiration: Transpiration is the process by which water vapor is released into the atmosphere by plants through tiny pores on their leaves called stomata.

It might be hard to believe but your water is actually really, really old. In fact, water on Earth is much older than the dinosaurs. Scientists estimate that the water on Earth is at least 4.6 billion years old. And the amount of water on Earth today, in lakes, rivers, oceans, glaciers, even under the ground and up in the clouds, it's about the same as it was millions and millions of years ago. That's because water is recycled. It just gets used again and again. And that brings us to the water cycle, which is how water continuously moves from the ground to the atmosphere and back again. And as water moves through the cycle, it changes form. In fact, water is the only substance on Earth that naturally exists in three states, solid, liquid, and gas. Have you seen water in all of its different states? Maybe on a hot day, you'll add some ice, which is water in its solid state, to a glass of liquid water. Or maybe when you take out some food that you've heated in the microwave, you'll see steam coming off of the food, which is water in its gas state as water vapor. When you think of water, you might think of the wide open ocean. Over 95% of all the water on Earth is in the ocean, so this is a great place to start with the water cycle. Here, energy from the sun warms up water on the surface of the ocean enough to turn it into water vapor. This is called evaporation. This water vapor is less dense, meaning it's lighter, than liquid water, so it rises up and up into the atmosphere. However, as the water vapor rises, the temperature in the atmosphere cools. In turn, the water vapor condenses into tiny liquid water droplets, or, as we see them, clouds. This is called condensation. Air currents then move these clouds all around the Earth. As a cloud collects more and more liquid water droplets, the water may be released from the cloud, pulled down by gravity, and then return to the ocean or land as precipitation, like rain. If it's really cold, though, the water drops may crystallize and become snow. The snow will fall to the ground and eventually melt back into a liquid and run off into a lake or river, pulled down by gravity, which flows back into the ocean where the whole process starts over again. But that's just one path water can take through the water cycle. It's like a choose your own adventure. Instead of snow melting and running off into a river, the snow could become part of an icy cold glacier and stay there for a long, long time, for thousands of years. Or rain can seep into the ground and become groundwater, where it's then absorbed by plant roots. In turn, through transpiration, the water"

0,learningmole,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://learningmole.com/the-water-cycle-for-kids/,"water to run on. So, how does water on Earth never run out? The answer is, Earth has been recycling water ever since it was formed, which was over 4 billion years ago. Water on Earth moves between seas, land and air in an ongoing cycle called the water cycle. During its cycle, water changes its form. It can be in the form of liquid, gas or solid. There are four different processes that the water cycle goes through: evaporation, condensation, precipitation and collection. Let’s learn about them in detail. 1. Evaporation The Sun heats up the water on Earth that is found in rivers, oceans and lakes. When the temperature of water rises, some of the water turns from liquid to gas. This gas is called water vapour, and the turning process is called “evaporation”. Evaporation also occurs in plants. Some water turns into vapour through the leaves of . This process is called transpiration. The water vapour rises up in the sky and settles in the atmosphere, then it gathers to form clouds. 2. Condensation Water vapour in the starts to cool down. The air moves the clouds around the globe. When vapour is cool enough, it turns into water again, mostly as rain. The transition from gas to liquid is called “condensation”. So, condensation is the opposite of evaporation. 3. Precipitation When too much water vapour gets condensed, water drops in the clouds become too heavy for the air to hold. As a result, they fall down from the sky in the form of rain, sleet, snow or hail. The water falling process is called “precipitation”. 4. Collection The final part of the water cycle is called “collection”. Water that falls from the sky is collected in many ways, and then it will evaporate back into the air to begin the cycle all over again. Some water falls directly into oceans, rivers or lakes. Water that falls on the land may flow on the ground until it reaches oceans, rivers or lakes. This water is called “surface run-off”. If the water falls on plants, it may evaporate again from the leaves through transpiration, or it may soak into the soil. From the soil, water slowly moves through the ground until it reaches a river, a lake or an ocean. In cold places, water that falls from the sky may turn into ice or glaciers. If the temperature rises, ice melts to liquid water and collects into any water body. So, this is how the water cycle goes: Heat from the Sun causes water in oceans, lakes and rivers to evaporate and rise up to the atmosphere. Water from plants and trees also enters the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. As water vapour rises high in the sky, it forms clouds and it condenses. When a cloud becomes heavy with water, precipitation occurs. Then, water collects in oceans, lakes and rivers, and the cycle starts all over again. Why Is the Water Cycle Important? The water cycle is very important because it ensures that water never runs out on Earth, so that all living organisms can survive. If water did not naturally recycle itself, we would run out of clean water, which is essential to life. In addition, the water cycle has an important role in balancing temperatures and weather patterns on Earth. Human Activities that Affect the Water Cycle Humans are responsible for disrupting and changing the water cycle in numerous ways; for example: The burning of fuels raises the Earth’s temperature. The increase of temperature causes an increase of evaporation and melting ice and glaciers.Using pesticides and other chemicals for farming runs off into rivers and natural water resources and pollutes water.Some emissions from industry cause acid rain. has a huge effect on the water cycle because, as we knew, trees release water vapor into the atmosphere through transpiration. So, if we cut down trees, less water evaporates, and then there is less rain.Humans change the flow of water in many ways, such as using irrigation, damming lakes and rivers to generate electricity, and pulling water out of the ground in order to use it. 15 Interesting Facts about the Water Cycle The water cycle is also known as the “hydrologic cycle”.Water can sometimes change into vapor from ice without first melting into liquid. This process is called “sublimation”.The driving energy of the water cycle comes from the Sun. When the Sun heats water on Earth, water evaporates and the cycle goes on.90% of all the water that evaporates into the atmosphere is from oceans. Water exists in three different states in the water cycle; liquid, gas and solid. The amount of water"

Humanity and civilization are intimately dependent on the water cycle, but we have manipulated it vastly and destructively, to suit our needs.We don’t yet know the full global implications of human modifications to the water cycle. We do know such changes could lead to huge shifts in Earth systems, threatening life as it exists. Researchers are asking where and how they can measure change to determine if the water cycle is being pushed to the breaking point.Recent research has indicated that modifications to aspects of the water cycle are now causing Earth system destabilization at a scale that modern civilization might not have ever faced. That is already playing out in extreme weather events and long-term slow-onset climate alterations, with repercussions we don’t yet understand.There are no easy or simple solutions. To increase our chances of remaining in a “safe living space,” we need to reverse damage to the global hydrological cycle with large-scale interventions, including reductions in water use, and reversals of deforestation, land degradation, soil erosion, air pollution and climate change. Water seems deceptively simple and is easy to take for granted. It has no color, taste or smell and is one of the most plentiful chemical compounds on Earth. Recycled endlessly through the biosphere in its various forms, it is fundamental to keeping our planet’s operating system intact, and has done so for millions of years. Water is life. Earth’s oceans are where life likely originated, and freshwater is essential for plants and animals to persist and thrive. It is basic to all human development. But as our 21st-century world gallops ahead, we are vastly manipulating the water cycle at an unprecedented rate and scale to meet the ever-growing needs of an exploding population. By 2030, we will have built enough dams to . Estimates vary, but we already use around . More than half of us now live in cities, but by 2050 a projected 68% of the world’s nearly 8 billion people will reside in urban areas. That — extracted, treated, and piped over large distances. Humanity also prevents much rainwater from easily infiltrating underground, reducing aquifers, as we pave over immense areas with impermeable concrete and asphalt. But these easily visible changes are only the proverbial tip of the iceberg. Researchers are shining new light on sweeping human alterations to Earth’s water cycle, many playing out in processes largely unseen. In the Anthropocene — the unofficial name for the current human-influenced unit of geologic time — we are already pushing one of Earth’s most fundamental and foundational systems, the hydrological cycle, toward the breaking point. Trouble is, we don’t yet know when this threshold may be reached, or what the precise consequences will be. Scientists are resolutely seeking answers. Water flows past Copenhagen in Denmark. As Earth’s urban areas expand, so do population pressures on the freshwater supply and the water cycle. Image by Petro Kotzé. Water cycle basics The hydrological cycle is powered by the sun and flows through eternal inhalations and exhalations of water in different states, as it is exchanged between the atmosphere and the planet. Liquid water from oceans, lakes and rivers rises via evaporation into the sky, to form water vapor, an important greenhouse gas that, like carbon dioxide, helps insulate the planet to maintain that “just right” temperature to maintain life as we know it. Atmospheric water vapor then changes to liquid, falling to earth as precipitation. It then flows as runoff again across the landscape, and what doesn’t go back into waterbodies, settles into soils, to be taken up by plants and released via transpiration as vapor skyward. A large amount of freshwater is also locked in glaciers and icecaps. Within this cycle, there are constant complex interactions between what scientists call blue and green water. Blue water includes rivers, lakes, reservoirs and renewable groundwater stores. Green water is defined as terrestrial precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture. Partitioning of rainwater into green and blue water flows. Image by Geertsma et al. (2009)/Baseline Review for the Pilot Programme in Kenya. Green Water Credits Report 8, ISRIC–World Soil Information, Wageningen. A fully functioning hydrological cycle, with balanced supplies and flows of blue and green water, is essential to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, human food availability and production, and our energy security. It also regulates Earth’s weather and influences climate. Atmospheric temperature, for example, is dependent on evaporation and condensation. That’s because as water evaporates, it absorbs energy and cools the local environment, and as it condenses, it releases energy and warms the world. Throughout the Holocene geological epoch, a relatively stable water cycle helped maintain balanced temperatures and conditions able to support civilization. However, in the Anthropocene, human activity has impacted the water cycle, the climate and ecosystems. For one, as more human-produced CO2 and methane build up in the atmosphere, more solar energy is held by the planet, causing global warming. And the hotter the air, the greater the quantity of water vapor the atmosphere can hold. That’s bad news because water vapor is itself a powerful greenhouse gas, greatly increasing the warming. Earth’s water cycle. Image courtesy of USGS. Measuring hydrological cycle change: ‘It’s complicated’ As our anthropogenic manipulation of the water cycle escalates on a global scale, we urgently need a holistic way to monitor these modifications and understand their impacts. Yet, the topic has not received the urgent scientific attention it requires. “To the best of our knowledge, there is no study comprehensively investigating whether human modifications of the water cycle have led, could be leading, or will lead to planetary‐scale regime shifts in the Earth system,” in a 2020 paper on the role of the water cycle in maintaining fundamental Earth functioning. One key concern of scientists: If severe hydrological shifts occur in too many regions, or in key regions that greatly influence the water cycle or water availability (such as the Amazon), then that could provoke shifts in other regions, in a global chain reaction, says study co-author Dieter Gerten, working group leader and Earth modeling coordinator at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. “Conceptually we know that there must be a limit for how much we can disturb the [hydrological] system before we start feeling serious impacts on the Earth system and then, by extension, to humanity,” says one of the paper’s other co-authors, Miina Porkka, a postdoctoral researcher at the Water and Development Group at Aalto University in Finland. International researchers under the auspices of the have been hammering away at answering these questions. They had to start with the basics. One big problem to date has been scientists’ lack of a metric for quantifying serious water cycle alterations. How do we even measure changes to the water cycle? “It gets complicated,” says Gerten, who has been involved in the research to bring a global perspective to local water management since 2009, as conducted under the ; Gerten is also a professor of global change climatology and hydrology at Humboldt University of Berlin. The Toktogul reservoir in Kyrgyzstan. The Anthropocene is producing wholesale manipulations to Earth’s water cycle. For example, by 2030, more than 90% of the world’s rivers will likely be altered by dams. Image by Petro Kotzé. Measuring change: Blue water The defines a safe operating space for humanity as represented by nine natural global processes that, if severely destabilized, could disrupt Earth’s operating system and threaten life and civilization. The freshwater planetary boundary presents one such threshold, and scientists are working to define a global limit to anthropogenic water cycle modifications. Initially, in 2009, river flow was used to try and measure the boundary threshold, Gerten explains, because blue water in all its forms was seen to integrate the three largest anthropogenic manipulations of the water cycle: human impacts on precipitation patterns, modifications of soil moisture by land use and land cover; and water withdrawals for human use. This research used a simple calculation of the global sum of the average annual surface water flow in rivers, with an assumed 30% of that accessible water needing to be protected. This “freshwater use” boundary was set at 4,000 cubic kilometers (960 cubic miles) per year of blue water consumption. This is at the lower limit of a 4,000-6,000 km3 (960-1,440 mi3) annual range designated as a danger zone that takes us “too close to the risk of blue and green water-induced thresholds that could have deleterious or even catastrophic impacts on the Earth System,” researchers wrote that evaluated the water planetary boundary. The Padysha-Ata River in Kyrgyzstan. Blue water includes rivers as well as lakes, reservoirs, and renewable groundwater stores. Image by Petro Kotzé. With only an estimated 2,600 km3 (624 mi3) of water withdrawn annually at the time of the study, scientists concluded we were still in the safe zone. However, “That [conclusion] was immediately criticized,” Gerten says, in part because scientists were already seeing ample regional water-related problems. Another criticism argued that the measure of blue water alone did not reflect all types of human interference with the water cycle and Earth system. Gerten later that proposed quantifying the boundary by assessing the amount of streamflow needed to maintain environmental flow requirements in all river basins on Earth. This approach had the advantage of recognizing regionally transgressed limits and thereby deduced a global value. According to this newer calculation, the freshwater use planetary boundary should be set much lower, at about 2,800 km3 (672 mi3), Gerten says, which means humanity is already much closer to the danger zone than previously thought. “Water is more limited on Planet Earth than we think,” Gerten cautions. The nine planetary boundaries, counterclockwise from top: climate change, biosphere integrity (functional and genetic), land-system change, freshwater change, biogeochemical flows (nitrogen and phosphorus), ocean acidification, atmospheric aerosol pollution, stratospheric ozone depletion, and release of novel chemicals. In 2022, scientists announced the transgression of both the freshwater and novel entities boundaries. Image courtesy of J. Lokrantz/Azote based on Steffen et al. (2015) via Stockholm Resilience Centre. Redefining the freshwater boundary: Green water Over time, a consortium of researchers was formed to deeply scrutinize the freshwater boundary. This resulted in proposing that the freshwater boundary be divided into sub-boundaries related to major stores of freshwater: namely atmospheric water, frozen water, groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water. Since then, scientists simplified their approach further. “Even though we are talking about very complex matters,” Porkka says, the boundary definition, to be useful as a metric, needed to stay “relatively simple.” The most recent and sweeping reassessment of the freshwater planetary boundary was . “Our suggestion is to … change the name from ‘freshwater use planetary boundary’ to ‘freshwater change planetary boundary,’” says study lead author Lan Wang-Erlandsson from the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “Then, to have two components,” she adds, “One for green water, and one for blue water.” “Water has so many functions in the Earth system, and many of them happen invisibly via green water,” Gerten explains. “We don’t see it and we don’t feel it. That’s why [green water] has been neglected over decades. The focus has been on river flows and groundwater because we can see it, feel it, use it, and touch it. But [as a result] a big share of the water cycle has been overlooked.” The Tsitsikamma forests in South Africa’s Garden Route region. The water taken up by plants and released via transpiration as vapor skyward is an integral part of the water cycle. Image by Petro Kotzé. The newly accepted metric for tracking green water: The soil moisture in the root zone of plants, or more technically: “the percentage of ice-free land area on which root-zone soil moisture anomalies exit the local bounds of baseline variability in any month of the year.” This new proxy is appealing because it is directly influenced by human pressures with change over time measurable. In turn, soil moisture directly impacts a range of large-scale ecological, climatic, biogeochemical and hydrological dynamics. Using this novel green water boundary transgression criteria, scientists detected a major hydrological departure from the baseline set during the Holocene. And the evidence for such a departure is overwhelming: Researchers found “unprecedented areas [of Earth] with root-zone soil moisture anomalies,” indicating an exit from the so-called “safe zone.” A second criteria, Earth Systems Resilience, was also instituted. Researchers evaluated the state of regional climate systems (ranging from monsoons to land carbon sinks and large biomes) to see which have seen enhanced changes in their process rates, resulting in ripple effects that could destabilize the Earth system, Wang-Erlandsson explains. Lake Sary-Chelek, part of a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, in Kyrgyzstan. The hydrological cycle represents an eternal exchange of water in different states between the atmosphere and the planet’s surface, and it maintains the biosphere as we know it. Within this cycle, there is constant interaction between blue and green water. Image by Petro Kotzé. A transgressed freshwater change boundary Unfortunately, examples of compromised Earth System Resilience transgressions are rife across the planet. Take the Amazon Rainforest, for instance. It is now understood that , with a sequestration decline since then driven by escalating climate change and fires, along with global demand for agricultural commodities, which spurred extensive Amazon forest clearing, bringing major land-use change. More recently, African tropical forests have passed their . When these vast biomes and natural systems are put under extreme multiple stressors, the effects can self-amplify and lead to greater, more rapid, rates of change, Wang-Erlandsson says: In South America, this combination of stressors, particularly deforestation and climate change, is inducing intensifying drought, which is now leading to cascading perturbations in living systems. Scientists now think the rainforest biome, stable for thousands of years, is reaching a , and could quickly transition to seasonal forest, or even a . This shift could lead to the transformation of the South American monsoon system, and a permanent state of reduced rainfall and impoverished biodiversity. But what starts in the Amazon won’t likely stay there: The rainforest’s destruction will release massive amounts of carbon, intensifying climate change, potentially leading to climate and ecological tipping points in other biomes. Agricultural development in Uzbekistan. Global land-use change, including large-scale deforestation and irrigation, is contributing to major alterations in the water cycle, leading to a destabilized climate and major global environmental and sociopolitical disruptions. Image by Petro Kotzé. Another concerning example (although debated) of an Earth system shift is the , in which higher atmospheric carbon concentrations result in speeded-up photosynthesis as plants try to improve water efficiency in the face of drought. It is thought that this effect is happening already, brought on by limitations in nutrient and soil moisture availability. In drylands, climate change and ecosystem degradation are triggering of — a decrease in soil moisture and moisture recycling, resulting in increasing desertification and biodiversity loss. In polar permafrost regions, soil moisture saturation could . Methane is a greenhouse gas far more powerful than carbon dioxide. Alarmed by the water cycle’s departure from the Holocene baseline, and noting “worrying” signs of low Earth System Resilience, researchers early in 2022 .” The situation, they said, will likely worsen before any reversals in the trend will be observed. “Green water modifications are now causing rising Earth system risks at a scale that modern civilizations might not have ever faced,” the study states. We don’t yet know what the planetary-scale impacts will ultimately be, but, Porkka says, we have an idea of how impacts could be felt in different parts of the world. An irrigation canal runs past apricot orchards in the Batken region of Kyrgyzstan. We have vastly manipulated Earth’s water cycle to suit humanity’s needs. Image by Petro Kotzé. Disastrous extreme weather events Regional extreme events, including floods and mega droughts, are already occurring, Porkka notes. Examples are to be found on every continent. On Africa’s southeast coast, as just one example: the World Weather Attribution (WWA) network of scientists has that human-induced climate change has increased the likelihood and intensity of heavy rainfall associated with tropical cyclones. The group based their findings on an analysis of tropical storms Ana and Batisrai, which battered parts of Madagascar, Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe in early 2022. Both cyclonic systems brought devastating floods that caused severe humanitarian impacts, including many deaths and injuries and large-scale damage to infrastructure. These sorts of extreme weather events put great pressure on socioeconomic and political institutions, and could easily destabilize struggling developing nations. And the situation is worsening. The , according to the World Meteorological Organization. An found more than 11,000 reported disasters attributed to such hazards globally, resulting in more than 2 million deaths and 521 billion) and floods ($115 billion). Clouds above a dusty road in the Northern Cape of South Africa. The hydrological cycle is powered by the sun and is an eternal exchange of water between the atmosphere and the planet. As climate change escalates, so do extreme weather events such as droughts and intense storms. Image by Petro Kotzé. Porkka points out, however, that freshwater system destabilization impacts can be more subtle than extreme events. Widespread irrigation of croplands, for example, can increase evaporation to such a high degree that even distant precipitation patterns are altered. Part of the problem is that we do not know if consequences like these are negative or positive. “[W]e know that we’re changing the [hydrological] system in fundamental ways and, once we do, we don’t really know how the impacts accumulate,” says Porkka. While many riddles remain, scientists now feel they have a reliable metric for accurately tracking transgressions of the freshwater change boundary. “The prime question was what the key variables are, and I think that is relatively solid now with soil moisture [green water] and river flows [blue water],” Gerten says. “The next questions are, where exactly to put the boundaries, and what happens if they are transgressed?” Based on these findings, researchers are calling for urgent action: “The current global trends and trajectories of increasing water use, deforestation, land degradation, soil erosion, atmospheric pollution, and climate change need to be promptly halted and reversed to increase the chances of remaining in [Earth’s] safe operating space.” That’s a tall order, and no matter humanity’s actions, we don’t know how things will play out. “Water is so fundamental and elemental, and at the same time, so varied,” Gerten says, and there is no silver bullet for solving our hydrological problems. South Africa’s Orange River tumbles over Augrabies Falls. Water is one of the most plentiful chemical compounds on Earth and is recycled endlessly through the biosphere in different forms.

0,miwaterstewardship,The 4 Processes of the Water Cycle and Some Cool Facts,https://miwaterstewardship.org/all-about-the-water-cycle/,"All About the Water Cycle - MI Water Stewardship Search for: All About the Water Cycle The Water Cycle Earth’s water is always in movement, and the natural water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. Water is always changing states between liquid, vapor, and ice, with these processes happening in the blink of an eye and over millions of years. What is the water cycle? Water Drops: Trickle, Droplette and Professor DewWe can easily answer that—it is “me” all over! The water cycle describes the existence and movement of water on, in, and above the Earth. Earth’s water is always in movement and is constantly changing states, from liquid to vapor to ice and back again. The water cycle has been working for billions of years and all life on Earth depends on it continuing to work. Dinosaurs once drank the same water we drink today, which is pretty neat to think about. We are not ever creating “new” water so that is what makes it so important that we take care of the water we have! These interactive water cycle diagrams from USGS allow you to “mouse around” the parts of the water cycle and view explanations, pictures, and more. Click the links below for the interactive water cycle diagrams: A summary of the water cycle You may think that every drop of rain that falls from the sky, or each glass of water that you drink, is brand new, but it has always been here and is a part of the water cycle. The heat of the sun provides energy to make the water cycle work. The sun evaporates water from the oceans into water vapor. This invisible vapor rises into the atmosphere, where the air is colder. The colder air causes water vapor to condense into water droplets and clouds. Volcanoes can produce steam, which forms clouds. In tha atmosphere, air currents move clouds all around the Earth. Water drops form in clouds, which then fall to Earth as precipitation (rain and snow). In cold climates, precipitation builds up as snow, ice, and glaciers. Snow can melt, becoming runoff, which flows into rivers, the oceans, and into the ground. Some ice evaporates directly into the air, skipping the melting phase (sublimation). Rainfall on land flows downhill as runoff, providing water to lakes, rivers, and the oceans. Some rain soaks into the ground, as infiltration, and, if deep enough, becomes groundwater. Water from lakes and rivers can seep into the ground. Water moves underground because of gravity and pressure. Groundwater close to the land surface is taken up by plants. Some groundwater seeps into rivers and lakes, and can flow to the surface as springs. Plants take up groundwater and evapotranspire, or evaporate, it from their leaves. Some groundwater goes very deep into the ground and stays there for a long time. Groundwater flows into the oceans, keeping the water cycle going.

Overview Students design and create their own miniature model of the water cycle using simple materials as a way to demonstrate their understanding of this natural process. Timing 45-60 minutes Setting the Stage The water cycle (or hydrological cycle) describes the continuous movement of water on Earth. The warming of water from the Sun causes the evaporation of liquid water molecules into water vapour that moves up into the atmosphere. As water vapour moves higher in the atmosphere temperatures start to decrease, causing the vapour to condense and form liquid water droplets. When these droplets get heavy, they drop to Earth as a form of precipitation (rain, snow, sleet or hail). In conducting this inquiry, students use their observation skills to note examples of the various states of water in their environment. The students use this information to help them design and create their own miniature model of the water cycle using simple materials as a way to demonstrate their understanding of this natural process. This inquiry could begin from: Questions or comments initiated by the students about how water comes in different forms and how that affects life on Earth. Discuss using questions such as: “Where do you think rain/snow come from?” “If I wanted to find liquid water in our community/environment, where would I look? Where might I find water in other forms?” (e.g., liquid water: puddle, river, lake, ocean, ponds, streams, water table, dew, rain barrel, sprinkler, water fountain; solid water: snow, ice, skating rink, icicles, frost; gaseous water (water vapour): fog, mist, steam, breath on a cold day) “How do different forms of water affect our daily lives?” (e.g., choice of clothing and footwear, outside activities, road conditions, safety considerations, water conservation issues) The water cycle (Source: Benutzer:Joooo-derivative work: moyogo (talk) -derivative work: Alexchris [CC BY-SA 3.0] via ). An exploration walk outside in the school yard, local neighbourhood or nearby park to identify evidence of water in the environment. Discuss using questions such as: “Where could we look for water in this outside area?” “If you wanted to find water in our community, where might you find it?”(e.g., natural: puddle, river, lake, ocean, pond, stream, water table; human-made: bird bath, water fountain, sprinkler, swimming pool, well, sewers, water-supply system, reservoir, water tower) “At [this time of year], in what forms do we see water in the environment?” (e.g., solid – visible as ice, snow, sleet, hail, frost; liquid – visible as rain, mist and dew; gas – visible as fog and steam) Walking in a puddle (Source: via ).

It's constantly moving around in a natural cycle. Some water is easy to see in our rivers and oceans, but some water is underground or in the atmosphere. Natural water cycle processes Properties of water Water on Earth Water cycle experiments Natural water cycle processes The natural water cycle is the continuous movement of water around the world through the processes of evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, run-off, infiltration and percolation. What happens in the natural water cycle? The natural water cycle uses physical processes to continually move water from the surface of the Earth to the atmosphere and back again. This cycle is also called the hydrological cycle. Evaporation is when the sun shines on water and heats it, turning it into gas called water vapour which rises into the air. Transpiration is when the sun warms people, plants and animals and they release water vapour into the air. Condensation is when the water vapour in the air cools and turns back into a liquid, forming tiny water droplets in the sky. Precipitation is when water droplets fall from the sky as rain, snow or hail. Run-off is when water flows over the ground and into creeks, rivers and oceans. Infiltration is when water falls on the ground and soaks into the soil. Percolation is when water seeps deeper into tiny spaces in the soil and rock. We modify and manage part of the natural water cycle to provide humans with water. This is called the urban water cycle. Properties of water Did you know? Water is the most common substance found on Earth. It's the only substance found naturally in 3 forms – solid (as ice), liquid (as water) and gas (as water vapour). Water is made up of tiny molecules. One water molecule, called H2O, is made up of 3 atoms – 2 hydrogen atoms and an oxygen atom. These atoms stick together due to electrical energy. Water is a solvent, which means it dissolves things. Wherever it travels, water carries chemicals, minerals and nutrients with it. This means water is more than what we can see. Water can be tested to see if it is acidic, basic or neutral. We like our water around neutral so it doesn't corrode pipes and home appliances. Water on Earth Did you know? Earth has exactly the same amount of water as it had thousands of years ago. The total amount of water on Earth is 1,386 million cubic kilometres. Water covers about three quarters of the Earth’s surface. 96% of the world’s water is saltwater. 3% is of the world’s water is freshwater, but most of it is frozen or not easy to get. Less than 1% of the world’s fresh water is useable. Water cycle experiments Have you ever wondered how water evaporates? Where clouds come from or where water goes after it rains?

The amount or mass of water on Earth remains fairly constant over time but the location of that water into the major reservoirs of saline water, ice, fresh water, and atmospheric water is variable and depends on a wide range of climatic variables. Water on Earth moves from one reservoir or store to another, such as from river to ocean, or from the ocean to the atmosphere, by the physical processes of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, infiltration, surface runoff, and subsurface flow. Movement between these stores often involves the water changing form between liquid, solid (ice) and vapour. The water cycle also involves the exchange of energy, which leads to temperature changes. When water evaporates, it takes up energy from its surroundings and cools the environment. When it condenses, it releases energy and warms the environment. These heat exchanges influence climate. 1 The Water Cycle by Ehud Tal [CC BY-SA 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)], from Wikimedia Commons 2 The water cycle starts with water evaporating from the ocean, this warm moist air rises in thermals where it cools as it rises through the troposphere (at the dry adiabatic lapse rate of 9.7°C per 1000m). As the air rises and cools it loses its capacity to hold water vapour as its relative humidity rises, and condensation occurs releasing latent heat. This forms clouds at the dew point, and these clouds are blown inland. Relief features can force the clouds higher, water droplets collide with one another and get bigger, and eventually the droplets are big enough to fall to earth as precipitation. This precipitation can be stored on the surface as snow or ice, or can be intercepted by trees and vegetation. On the trees or vegetation the water can be dripped off leaves, flow down the vegetation as stem flow or be taken up and lost as transpiration. The combined losses of water through transpiration and evaporation are known as EVAPOTRANSPIRATION. It could also fall straight into the ground where it can percolate into the soil then infiltrate into the rock underneath if the soil and rock are permeable. If the rock is not permeable or the soil stores are full then surface runoff will occur. This water will then work its way through the soil (soil flow) or rock (through flow) or over the land and into streams and rivers. These small tributary streams join together at confluences and the river will grow in size and strength. These processes are variable over time and space. Not all parts of the world have precipitation all year for example, some have noticeable dry seasons. NEXT TOPIC - 1 - Wikipedia (2018). Water Cycle.

DNA replication is important for cell division, which is necessary for growth and repair of multicellular organisms, and reproduction in single celled organisms. DNA replication creates a new, identical copy of DNA. This occurs prior to cell division, when one cell splits into two identical daughter cells. Each daughter cell needs a copy of DNA, so DNA must be duplicated prior to cell division. DNA Replication Steps and Process An error occurred trying to load this video.

Helicase unwinds the DNA strands and breaks the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides in either strand of DNA. This opens up the DNA and will allow DNA polymerase to read the DNA and create a copy. Helicase is accompanied by , which removes supercoiling effects ahead of helicase. Much like pulling on two strings that are twisted together, the actions of helicase causes supercoiling in the upstream DNA strands. Topoisomerse removes this and allows helicase to continue unwinding DNA. The unwound strands are covered by single strand binding proteins that prevent the two DNA strands from reannealing.When Does DNA Replication Occur?DNA replication begins prior to cell division during the S phase of the cell cycle. The cell cycle encompasses the events that occur during a cell's life. During G1, the cell grows and does its job in the body. During the S phase, DNA replication begins and creates two identical copies of DNA. During G2 the cell makes its final preparations for cell division and replicates organelles. Then, finally in mitosis, or M phase, the cell divides and each daughter cell receives an identical copy of DNA created during S phase. DNA replication occurs during S phase of the cell cycle Where Does DNA Replication Occur?DNA replication occurs in the nucleus in eukaryotic cells and in the nucleoid region of prokaryotic cells. Eukaryotic cells are cells that have a nucleus and membrane bound organelles, such as plant cells and animal cells. Eukaryotic cells contain their DNA in the nucleus, and thus this is where DNA replication occurs. Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus, and thus DNA replication occurs in the region of the cytoplasm that contains the DNA, called the nucleoid region.DNA Replication StepsThere are three main steps to DNA replication: Unzipping Elongation Termination Step 1: UnzippingThe first step in DNA replication is the unzipping of DNA by the enzyme helicase. This opens up the DNA nucleotides so that they can be read and a complementary strand can be formed.Step 2: ElongationDuring the elongation stage the enzyme primase creates a small complementary sequence of RNA nucleotides called a primer. This will be removed later and replaced with DNA nucleotides, but it is necessary to provide DNA polymerase with a place to latch onto. DNA polymerase binds to the primer and synthesizes DNA in the 5' to 3' direction. The numbers indicate the orientation of the carbon atoms in the sugar in each nucleotide. The two strands in DNA are complementary, one strand is oriented from 5' to 3' and the other from 3' to 5'. DNA polymerase only adds nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction. This means that only one strand is oriented correctly to be synthesized continuously. This strand is called the leading strand. The other strand, called the lagging strand is synthesized in fragments called Okazaki fragments as DNA opens up. These fragments are later fused together by the enzyme DNA ligase. This process continues throughout the DNA molecule until both strands have been replicated. Step 3: TerminationDuring termination, DNA replication comes to an end. An exonuclease enzyme removes the DNA primers and replaces them with DNA. DNA ligase fuses together the Okazaki fragments and telomerase adds telomeres to the ends of DNA. are short repeated sequences at the ends of the chromosome that help ensure chromosome integrity.DNA Replication EnzymesSo, far we've learned about many different enzymes involved in the DNA replication process, let's look at their function in more detail next. Helicase: Unwinds DNA Topoisomerase: Prevents DNA supercoiling Single strand binding proteins: Separates single DNA strands Primase: Creates complementary RNA primers DNA polymerase: Replicates DNA : Removes RNA primers and replaces with DNA DNA ligase: Connects Okazaki fragments : Creates telomeres DNA Polymerase is one of the most important enzymes in DNA replication. It does the bulk of the work, reading the parent DNA strands and creating new, complementary strands. DNA polymerase also has proofreading functions, which allow it to excise mismatched nucleotides and replace them with the correct nucleotides. This makes DNA polymerase very high fidelity and prevents mutations.DNA Replication DiagramThe following is a diagram showing the replication of both leading and lagging strands in DNA. DNA replication diagam Lesson SummaryDNA replication is the process of creating two identical daughter strands of DNA. DNA replication occurs in the nucleus in eukaryotic cells and in the nucleoid region in prokaryotic cells. DNA replication occurs in S phase during the cell cycle prior to cell division. DNA replication occurs in three main steps: Unzipping: Helicase unwinds DNA and topoisomerse prevents supercoiling to open the DNA for DNA polymerase. Elongation: DNA polymerase is the replicating enzyme that works in the 5' to 3' direction to create a complementary strand of DNA in the 3' to 5' orientation. The strand synthesized continuously is called the leading strand and the strand synthesized in fragments is called the lagging strand. Termination: During termination the primers are removed and replaced with DNA in both the leading and lagging strand, the fragments are ligated together, and telomeres are added.

S phase: the synthesis phase, when the DNA and genetic material of the cell are duplicated, forming two sister chromatids. G2 phase: the second gap phase, when cytoplasmic materials needed for division are gathered with metabolic changes. M phase: the mitosis phase, when the genetic material and the cell divide.

DNA Replication Animation - Super EASYPlay DNA Strand Mismatch Repair During the process of DNA replication, errors can sometimes occur. Nucleotide bases may be inserted, deleted, or mismatched into the DNA strand incorrectly. For this reason, it is important for the biological system to have mechanisms in place to detect and repair these errors. Mismatch errors are relatively common in the new copy strand of DNA, but it is possible for the repair mechanism to detect these by comparing it to the original strand. This system helps detect DNA helix distortions, distinguish between the two strands, and remove replication errors.

0,en.wikipedia,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_replication,"DNA molecule. DNA replication occurs in all living organisms acting as the most essential part of biological inheritance. This is essential for cell division during growth and repair of damaged tissues, while it also ensures that each of the new cells receives its own copy of the DNA. The cell possesses the distinctive property of division, which makes replication of DNA essential. DNA is made up of a of two . The double helix describes the appearance of a double-stranded DNA which is thus composed of two linear strands that run opposite to each other and twist together to form. During replication, these strands are separated. Each strand of the original DNA molecule then serves as a template for the production of its counterpart, a process referred to as . As a result of semi-conservative replication, the new helix will be composed of an original DNA strand as well as a newly synthesized strand. Cellular and error-checking mechanisms ensure near perfect for DNA replication. In a , DNA replication begins at specific locations, or , in the which contains the genetic material of an organism. Unwinding of DNA at the origin and synthesis of new strands, accommodated by an known as , results in growing bi-directionally from the origin. A number of are associated with the replication fork to help in the initiation and continuation of . Most prominently, synthesizes the new strands by adding that complement each (template) strand. DNA replication occurs during the S-stage of . DNA replication (DNA amplification) can also be performed (artificially, outside a cell). DNA polymerases isolated from cells and artificial DNA primers can be used to start DNA synthesis at known sequences in a template DNA molecule. (PCR), (LCR), and (TMA) are examples. In March 2021, researchers reported evidence suggesting that a preliminary form of , a necessary component of , the biological synthesis of new in accordance with the , could have been a replicator molecule itself in the very early development of life, or . DNA structure[] The structure of the DNA (type ). The in the structure are colour-coded by and the detailed structures of two are shown in the bottom right. DNA exists as a double-stranded structure, with both strands coiled together to form the characteristic . Each single strand of DNA is a chain of four types of . Nucleotides in DNA contain a sugar, a , and a . The four types of correspond to the four , , , and , commonly abbreviated as A, C, G, and T. Adenine and guanine are bases, while cytosine and thymine are . These nucleotides form , creating the phosphate-deoxyribose backbone of the DNA double helix with the nucleobases pointing inward (i.e., toward the opposing strand). Nucleobases are matched between strands through to form . Adenine pairs with thymine (two hydrogen bonds), and guanine pairs with cytosine (three ). , and the different ends of a single strand are called the ""3′ (three-prime) end"" and the ""5′ (five-prime) end"". By convention, if the base sequence of a single strand of DNA is given, the left end of the sequence is the 5′ end, while the right end of the sequence is the 3′ end. The strands of the double helix are anti-parallel, with one being 5′ to 3′, and the opposite strand 3′ to 5′. These terms refer to the carbon atom in deoxyribose to which the next phosphate in the chain attaches. Directionality has consequences in DNA synthesis, because DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA in only one direction by adding nucleotides to the 3′ end of a DNA strand. The pairing of complementary bases in DNA (through hydrogen bonding) means that the information contained within each strand is redundant. Phosphodiester (intra-strand) bonds are stronger than hydrogen (inter-strand) bonds. The actual job of the phosphodiester bonds is where in DNA polymers connect the 5' carbon atom of one nucleotide to the 3' carbon atom of another nucleotide, while the hydrogen bonds stabilize DNA double helices across the helix axis but not in the direction of the axis. This allows the strands to be separated from one another. The nucleotides on a single strand can therefore be used to reconstruct nucleotides on a newly synthesized partner strand. DNA polymerase[] Main article: DNA polymerases adds nucleotides to the 3′ end of a strand of DNA. If a mismatch is accidentally incorporated, the polymerase is inhibited from further extension. Proofreading removes the mismatched nucleotide and extension continues. are a family of that carry out all forms of DNA replication. DNA polymerases in general cannot initiate synthesis of new strands but can only extend an existing DNA or RNA strand paired with a template strand. To begin synthesis, a short fragment of RNA, called a , must be created and paired with the template DNA strand. DNA polymerase adds a new strand of DNA by extending the 3′ end of an existing nucleotide chain, adding new matched to the template strand, one at a time, via the creation of . The energy for this process of DNA polymerization comes from hydrolysis of the (phosphoanhydride) bonds between the three phosphates attached to each unincorporated . Free bases with their attached phosphate groups are called ; in particular, bases with three attached phosphate groups are called . When a nucleotide is being added to a growing DNA strand, the formation of a phosphodiester bond between the proximal phosphate of the nucleotide to the growing chain is accompanied by hydrolysis of a high-energy phosphate bond with release of the two distal phosphate groups as a . Enzymatic hydrolysis of the resulting into inorganic phosphate consumes a second high-energy phosphate bond and renders the reaction effectively irreversible. In general, DNA polymerases are highly accurate, with an intrinsic error rate of less than one mistake for every 107 nucleotides added. In addition, some DNA polymerases also have proofreading ability; they can remove nucleotides from the end of a growing strand in order to correct mismatched bases. Finally, post-replication mismatch repair mechanisms monitor the DNA for errors, being capable of distinguishing mismatches in the newly synthesized DNA strand from the original strand sequence. Together, these three discrimination steps enable replication fidelity of less than one mistake for every 109 nucleotides added. The rate of DNA replication in a living cell was first measured as the rate of phage T4 DNA elongation in phage-infected E. coli. During the period of exponential DNA increase at 37 °C, the rate was 749 nucleotides per second. The mutation rate per base pair per replication during phage T4 DNA synthesis is 1.7 per 108. Replication process[] Main articles: and Overview of the steps in DNA replication Steps in DNA synthesis DNA replication, like all biological polymerization processes, proceeds in three enzymatically catalyzed and coordinated steps: initiation, elongation and termination. Initiation[] Role of initiators for initiation of DNA replication Formation of pre-replication complex For a , it must first replicate its DNA. DNA replication is an all-or-none process; once replication begins, it proceeds to completion. Once replication is complete, it does not occur again in the same cell cycle. This is made possible by the division of initiation of the . Pre-replication complex[] Main article: In late and early , a large complex of initiator proteins assembles into the pre-replication complex at particular points in the DNA, known as """". In the primary initiator protein is ; in , this is the . Sequences used by initiator proteins tend to be ""AT-rich"" (rich in adenine and thymine bases), because A-T base pairs have two hydrogen bonds (rather than the three formed in a C-G pair) and thus are easier to strand-separate. In eukaryotes, the origin recognition complex catalyzes the assembly of initiator proteins into the pre-replication complex. In addition, a recent report suggests that budding yeast ORC dimerizes in a cell cycle dependent manner to control licensing. In turn, the process of ORC dimerization is mediated by a cell cycle-dependent Noc3p dimerization cycle in vivo, and this role of Noc3p is separable from its role in ribosome biogenesis. ORC and Noc3p are continuously bound to the chromatin throughout the cell cycle. and then associate with the bound origin recognition complex at the origin in order to form a larger complex necessary to load the onto the DNA. The Mcm complex is the helicase that will unravel the DNA helix at the replication origins and in eukaryotes. The Mcm complex is recruited at late G1 phase and loaded by the ORC-Cdc6-Cdt1 complex onto the DNA via ATP-dependent protein remodeling. The loading of the Mcm complex onto the origin DNA marks the completion of pre-replication complex formation. If environmental conditions are right in late G1 phase, the G1 and G1/S - complexes are activated, which stimulate expression of genes that encode components of the DNA synthetic machinery. G1/S-Cdk activation also promotes the expression and activation of S-Cdk complexes, which may play a role in activating replication origins depending on species and cell type. Control of these Cdks vary depending on cell type and stage of development. This regulation is best understood in , where the S cyclins and are primarily responsible for DNA replication. Clb5,6-Cdk1 complexes directly trigger the activation of replication origins and are therefore required throughout S phase to directly activate each origin. In a similar manner, is also required through to activate replication origins. Cdc7 is not active throughout the cell cycle, and its activation is strictly timed to avoid premature initiation of DNA replication. In late G1, Cdc7 activity rises abruptly as a result of association with the regulatory subunit , which binds Cdc7 directly and promotes its protein kinase activity. Cdc7 has been found to be a rate-limiting regulator of origin activity. Together, the G1/S-Cdks and/or S-Cdks and Cdc7 collaborate to directly activate the replication origins, leading to initiation of DNA synthesis. Preinitiation complex[] In early S phase, S-Cdk and Cdc7 activation lead to the assembly of the preinitiation complex, a massive protein complex formed at the origin. Formation of the preinitiation complex displaces Cdc6 and Cdt1 from the origin replication complex, inactivating and disassembling the pre-replication complex. Loading the preinitiation complex onto the origin activates the Mcm helicase, causing unwinding of the DNA helix. The preinitiation complex also loads and other DNA polymerases onto the DNA. After α-primase synthesizes the first primers, the primer-template junctions interact with the clamp loader, which loads the sliding clamp onto the DNA to begin DNA synthesis. The components of the preinitiation complex remain associated with replication forks as they move out from the origin. Elongation[] DNA polymerase has 5′–3′ activity. All known DNA replication systems require a free 3′ group before synthesis can be initiated (note: the DNA template is read in 3′ to 5′ direction whereas a new strand is synthesized in the 5′ to 3′ direction—this is often confused). Four distinct mechanisms for DNA synthesis are recognized: All cellular life forms and many DNA , and use a to synthesize a short RNA primer with a free 3′ OH group which is subsequently elongated by a DNA polymerase. The retroelements (including ) employ a transfer RNA that primes DNA replication by providing a free 3′ OH that is used for elongation by the . In the and the φ29 family of , the 3′ OH group is provided by the side chain of an amino acid of the genome attached protein (the terminal protein) to which nucleotides are added by the DNA polymerase to form a new strand. In the single stranded DNA viruses—a group that includes the , the , the and others—and also the many phages and that use the rolling circle replication (RCR) mechanism, the RCR endonuclease creates a nick in the genome strand (single stranded viruses) or one of the DNA strands (plasmids). The 5′ end of the nicked strand is transferred to a residue on the nuclease and the free 3′ OH group is then used by the DNA polymerase to synthesize the new strand. The first is the best known of these mechanisms and is used by the cellular organisms. In this mechanism, once the two strands are separated, adds RNA primers to the template strands. The leading strand receives one RNA primer while the lagging strand receives several. The leading strand is continuously extended from the primer by a DNA polymerase with high , while the lagging strand is extended discontinuously from each primer forming . removes the primer RNA fragments, and a low processivity DNA polymerase distinct from the replicative polymerase enters to fill the gaps. When this is complete, a single nick on the leading strand and several nicks on the lagging strand can be found. works to fill these nicks in, thus completing the newly replicated DNA molecule. The primase used in this process differs significantly between and /. Bacteria use a primase belonging to the protein superfamily which contains a catalytic domain of the TOPRIM fold type. The TOPRIM fold contains an α/β core with four conserved strands in a topology. This structure is also found in the catalytic domains of Ia, topoisomerase II, the OLD-family nucleases and DNA repair proteins related to the RecR protein. The primase used by archaea and eukaryotes, in contrast, contains a highly derived version of the (RRM). This primase is structurally similar to many viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, cyclic nucleotide generating cyclases and DNA polymerases of the A/B/Y families that are involved in DNA replication and repair. In eukaryotic replication, the primase forms a complex with Pol α. Multiple DNA polymerases take on different roles in the DNA replication process. In , is the polymerase enzyme primarily responsible for DNA replication. It assembles into a replication complex at the replication fork that exhibits extremely high processivity, remaining intact for the entire replication cycle. In contrast, is the enzyme responsible for replacing RNA primers with DNA. DNA Pol I has a 5′ to 3′ activity in addition to its polymerase activity, and uses its exonuclease activity to degrade the RNA primers ahead of it as it extends the DNA strand behind it, in a process called . Pol I is much less processive than Pol III because its primary function in DNA replication is to create many short DNA regions rather than a few very long regions. In , the low-processivity enzyme, Pol α, helps to initiate replication because it forms a complex with primase. In eukaryotes, leading strand synthesis is thought to be conducted by Pol ε; however, this view has recently been challenged, suggesting a role for Pol δ. Primer removal is completed Pol δ while repair of DNA during replication is completed by Pol ε. As DNA synthesis continues, the original DNA strands continue to unwind on each side of the bubble, forming a with two prongs. In bacteria, which have a single origin of replication on their circular chromosome, this process creates a """" (resembling the Greek letter theta: θ). In contrast, eukaryotes have longer linear chromosomes and initiate replication at multiple origins within these. Replication fork[] Scheme of the replication fork.a: template, b: leading strand, c: lagging strand, d: replication fork, e: primer, f: Many enzymes are involved in the DNA replication fork. The replication fork is a structure that forms within the long helical DNA during DNA replication. It is created by helicases, which break the hydrogen bonds holding the two DNA strands together in the helix. The resulting structure has two branching ""prongs"", each one made up of a single strand of DNA. These two strands serve as the template for the leading and lagging strands, which will be created as DNA polymerase matches complementary nucleotides to the templates; the templates may be properly referred to as the leading strand template and the lagging strand template. DNA is read by DNA polymerase in the 3′ to 5′ direction, meaning the new strand is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction. Since the leading and lagging strand templates are oriented in opposite directions at the replication fork, a major issue is how to achieve synthesis of new lagging strand DNA, whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. Leading strand[] The leading strand is the strand of new DNA which is synthesized in the same direction as the growing replication fork. This sort of DNA replication is continuous. Lagging strand[] The lagging strand is the strand of new DNA whose direction of synthesis is opposite to the direction of the growing replication fork. Because of its orientation, replication of the lagging strand is more complicated as compared to that of the leading strand. As a consequence, the DNA polymerase on this strand is seen to ""lag behind"" the other strand. The lagging strand is synthesized in short, separated segments. On the lagging strand template, a ""reads"" the template DNA and initiates synthesis of a short complementary primer. A DNA polymerase extends the primed segments, forming . The RNA primers are then removed and replaced with DNA, and the fragments of DNA are joined by . Dynamics at the replication fork[] The assembled human DNA clamp, a of the protein In all cases the helicase is composed of six polypeptides that wrap around only one strand of the DNA being replicated. The two polymerases are bound to the helicase heximer. In eukaryotes the helicase wraps around the leading strand, and in prokaryotes it wraps around the lagging strand. As helicase unwinds DNA at the replication fork, the DNA ahead is forced to rotate. This process results in a build-up of twists in the DNA ahead. This build-up forms a torsional resistance that would eventually halt the progress of the replication fork. Topoisomerases are enzymes that temporarily break the strands of DNA, relieving the tension caused by unwinding the two strands of the DNA helix; topoisomerases (including ) achieve this by adding negative to the DNA helix. Bare single-stranded DNA tends to fold back on itself forming ; these structures can interfere with the movement of DNA polymerase. To prevent this, bind to the DNA until a second strand is synthesized, preventing secondary structure formation. Double-stranded DNA is coiled around that play an important role in regulating gene expression so the replicated DNA must be coiled around histones at the same places as the original DNA. To ensure this, histone disassemble the before it is replicated and replace the histones in the correct place. Some steps in this reassembly are somewhat speculative. form a sliding clamp around DNA, helping the DNA polymerase maintain contact with its template, thereby assisting with processivity. The inner face of the clamp enables DNA to be threaded through it. Once the polymerase reaches the end of the template or detects double-stranded DNA, the sliding clamp undergoes a conformational change that releases the DNA polymerase. Clamp-loading proteins are used to initially load the clamp, recognizing the junction between template and RNA primers.:274-5 DNA replication proteins[] At the replication fork, many replication enzymes assemble on the DNA into a complex molecular machine called the . The following is a list of major DNA replication enzymes that participate in the replisome: Enzyme Function in DNA replication Also known as helix destabilizing enzyme. Helicase separates the two strands of DNA at the behind the topoisomerase. The enzyme responsible for catalyzing the addition of nucleotide substrates to DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction during DNA replication. Also performs proof-reading and error correction. There exist many different types of DNA Polymerase, each of which perform different functions in different types of cells. A protein which prevents elongating DNA polymerases from dissociating from the DNA parent strand. Bind to ssDNA and prevent the DNA double helix from re-annealing after DNA helicase unwinds it, thus maintaining the strand separation, and facilitating the synthesis of the new strand. Relaxes the DNA from its super-coiled nature. Relieves strain of unwinding by DNA helicase; this is a specific type of topoisomerase Re-anneals the semi-conservative strands and joins of the lagging strand. Provides a starting point of RNA (or DNA) for DNA polymerase to begin synthesis of the new DNA strand. Lengthens telomeric DNA by adding repetitive nucleotide sequences to the ends of . This allows germ cells and stem cells to avoid the Hayflick limit on cell division. Replication machinery[] E. coli Replisome. Notably, the DNA on lagging strand forms a loop. The exact structure of replisome is not well understood. Replication machineries consist of factors involved in DNA replication and appearing on template ssDNAs. Replication machineries include primosotors are replication enzymes; DNA polymerase, DNA helicases, DNA clamps and DNA topoisomerases, and replication proteins; e.g. single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSB). In the replication machineries these components coordinate. In most of the bacteria, all of the factors involved in DNA replication are located on replication forks and the complexes stay on the forks during DNA replication. These replication machineries are called or DNA replicase systems. These terms are generic terms for proteins located on replication forks. In eukaryotic and some bacterial cells the replisomes are not formed. Since replication machineries do not move relatively to template DNAs such as factories, they are called a replication factory. In an alternative figure, DNA factories are similar to projectors and DNAs are like as cinematic films passing constantly into the projectors. In the replication factory model, after both DNA helicases for leading strands and lagging strands are loaded on the template DNAs, the helicases run along the DNAs into each other. The helicases remain associated for the remainder of replication process. Peter Meister et al. observed directly replication sites in budding yeast by monitoring green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged DNA polymerases α. They detected DNA replication of pairs of the tagged loci spaced apart symmetrically from a replication origin and found that the distance between the pairs decreased markedly by time. This finding suggests that the mechanism of DNA replication goes with DNA factories. That is, couples of replication factories are loaded on replication origins and the factories associated with each other. Also, template DNAs move into the factories, which bring extrusion of the template ssDNAs and new DNAs. Meister's finding is the first direct evidence of replication factory model. Subsequent research has shown that DNA helicases form dimers in many eukaryotic cells and bacterial replication machineries stay in single intranuclear location during DNA synthesis. The replication factories perform disentanglement of sister chromatids. The disentanglement is essential for distributing the chromatids into daughter cells after DNA replication. Because sister chromatids after DNA replication hold each other by rings, there is the only chance for the disentanglement in DNA replication. Fixing of replication machineries as replication factories can improve the success rate of DNA replication. If replication forks move freely in chromosomes, catenation of nuclei is aggravated and impedes mitotic segregation. Termination[] Eukaryotes initiate DNA replication at multiple points in the chromosome, so replication forks meet and terminate at many points in the chromosome. Because eukaryotes have linear chromosomes, DNA replication is unable to reach the very end of the chromosomes. Due to this problem, DNA is lost in each replication cycle from the end of the chromosome. are regions of repetitive DNA close to the ends and help prevent loss of genes due to this shortening. Shortening of the telomeres is a normal process in . This shortens the telomeres of the daughter DNA chromosome. As a result, cells can only divide a certain number of times before the DNA loss prevents further division. (This is known as the .) Within the line, which passes DNA to the next generation, extends the repetitive sequences of the telomere region to prevent degradation. Telomerase can become mistakenly active in somatic cells, sometimes leading to formation. Increased telomerase activity is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Termination requires that the progress of the DNA replication fork must stop or be blocked. Termination at a specific locus, when it occurs, involves the interaction between two components: (1) a termination site sequence in the DNA, and (2) a protein which binds to this sequence to physically stop DNA replication. In various bacterial species, this is named the DNA replication terminus site-binding protein, or . Because bacteria have circular chromosomes, termination of replication occurs when the two replication forks meet each other on the opposite end of the parental chromosome. E. coli regulates this process through the use of termination sequences that, when bound by the , enable only one direction of replication fork to pass through. As a result, the replication forks are constrained to always meet within the termination region of the chromosome. Regulation[] Main articles: and The cell cycle of eukaryotic cells Eukaryotes[] Within eukaryotes, DNA replication is controlled within the context of the . As the cell grows and divides, it progresses through stages in the cell cycle; DNA replication takes place during the S phase (synthesis phase). The progress of the eukaryotic cell through the cycle is controlled by . Progression through checkpoints is controlled through complex interactions between various proteins, including and . Unlike bacteria, eukaryotic DNA replicates in the confines of the nucleus. The G1/S checkpoint (or restriction checkpoint) regulates whether eukaryotic cells enter the process of DNA replication and subsequent division. Cells that do not proceed through this checkpoint remain in the G0 stage and do not replicate their DNA. After passing through the G1/S checkpoint, DNA must be replicated only once in each cell cycle. When the Mcm complex moves away from the origin, the pre-replication complex is dismantled. Because a new Mcm complex cannot be loaded at an origin until the pre-replication subunits are reactivated, one origin of replication can not be used twice in the same cell cycle. Activation of S-Cdks in early S phase promotes the destruction or inhibition of individual pre-replication complex components, preventing immediate reassembly. S and M-Cdks continue to block pre-replication complex assembly even after S phase is complete, ensuring that assembly cannot occur again until all Cdk activity is reduced in late mitosis. In budding yeast, inhibition of assembly is caused by Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of pre-replication complex components. At the onset of S phase, phosphorylation of Cdc6 by causes the binding of Cdc6 to the , which causes proteolytic destruction of Cdc6. Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of Mcm proteins promotes their export out of the nucleus along with Cdt1 during S phase, preventing the loading of new Mcm complexes at origins during a single cell cycle. Cdk phosphorylation of the origin replication complex also inhibits pre-replication complex assembly. The individual presence of any of these three mechanisms is sufficient to inhibit pre-replication complex assembly. However, mutations of all three proteins in the same cell does trigger reinitiation at many origins of replication within one cell cycle. In animal cells, the protein is a key inhibitor of pre-replication complex assembly. Geminin binds Cdt1, preventing its binding to the origin recognition complex. In G1, levels of geminin are kept low by the APC, which ubiquitinates geminin to target it for degradation. When geminin is destroyed, Cdt1 is released, allowing it to function in pre-replication complex assembly. At the end of G1, the APC is inactivated, allowing geminin to accumulate and bind Cdt1. Replication of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes occurs independently of the cell cycle, through the process of . Replication focus[] In vertebrate cells, replication sites concentrate into positions called replication foci. Replication sites can be detected by immunostaining daughter strands and replication enzymes and monitoring GFP-tagged replication factors. By these methods it is found that replication foci of varying size and positions appear in S phase of cell division and their number per nucleus is far smaller than the number of genomic replication forks. P. Heun et al.,(2001) tracked GFP-tagged replication foci in budding yeast cells and revealed that replication origins move constantly in G1 and S phase and the dynamics decreased significantly in S phase. Traditionally, replication sites were fixed on spatial structure of chromosomes by nuclear matrix or lamins. The Heun's results denied the traditional concepts, budding yeasts do not have lamins, and support that replication origins self-assemble and form replication foci. By firing of replication origins, controlled spatially and temporally, the formation of replication foci is regulated. D. A. Jackson et al.(1998) revealed that neighboring origins fire simultaneously in mammalian cells. Spatial juxtaposition of replication sites brings clustering of replication forks. The clustering do rescue of stalled replication forks and favors normal progress of replication forks. Progress of replication forks is inhibited by many factors; collision with proteins or with complexes binding strongly on DNA, deficiency of dNTPs, nicks on template DNAs and so on. If replication forks stall and the remaining sequences from the stalled forks are not replicated, the daughter strands have nick obtained un-replicated sites. The un-replicated sites on one parent's strand hold the other strand together but not daughter strands. Therefore, the resulting sister chromatids cannot separate from each other and cannot divide into 2 daughter cells. When neighboring origins fire and a fork from one origin is stalled, fork from other origin access on an opposite direction of the stalled fork and duplicate the un-replicated sites. As other mechanism of the rescue there is application of dormant replication origins that excess origins do not fire in normal DNA replication. Bacteria[] Dam methylates adenine of GATC sites after replication Most bacteria do not go through a well-defined cell cycle but instead continuously copy their DNA; during rapid growth, this can result in the concurrent occurrence of multiple rounds of replication. In E. coli, the best-characterized bacteria, DNA replication is regulated through several mechanisms, including: the hemimethylation and sequestering of the origin sequence, the ratio of to , and the levels of protein DnaA. All these control the binding of initiator proteins to the origin sequences. Because E. coli GATC DNA sequences, DNA synthesis results in hemimethylated sequences. This hemimethylated DNA is recognized by the protein , which binds and sequesters the origin sequence; in addition, DnaA (required for initiation of replication) binds less well to hemimethylated DNA. As a result, newly replicated origins are prevented from immediately initiating another round of DNA replication. ATP builds up when the cell is in a rich medium, triggering DNA replication once the cell has reached a specific size. ATP competes with ADP to bind to DnaA, and the DnaA-ATP complex is able to initiate replication. A certain number of DnaA proteins are also required for DNA replication — each time the origin is copied, the number of binding sites for DnaA doubles, requiring the synthesis of more DnaA to enable another initiation of replication. In fast-growing bacteria, such as E. coli, chromosome replication takes more time than dividing the cell. The bacteria solve this by initiating a new round of replication before the previous one has been terminated. The new round of replication will form the chromosome of the cell that is born two generations after the dividing cell. This mechanism creates overlapping replication cycles.

(May 2020) Replication fork restarts by homologous recombination following replication stress Epigenetic consequences of nucleosome reassembly defects at stalled replication forks There are many events that contribute to replication stress, including: Misincorporation of ribonucleotides Unusual Conflicts between replication and transcription Insufficiency of essential replication factors Overexpression or constitutive activation of inaccessibility Polymerase chain reaction[] Main article: Researchers commonly replicate DNA in vitro using the (PCR). PCR uses a pair of to span a target region in template DNA, and then polymerizes partner strands in each direction from these primers using a thermostable . Repeating this process through multiple cycles amplifies the targeted DNA region. At the start of each cycle, the mixture of template and primers is heated, separating the newly synthesized molecule and template. Then, as the mixture cools, both of these become templates for annealing of new primers, and the polymerase extends from these. As a result, the number of copies of the target region doubles each round, . See also[] Wikimedia Commons has media related to . Wikiversity has learning resources about Notes[] The of this process may also help explain the directionality of synthesis—if DNA were synthesized in the 3′ to 5′ direction, the energy for the process would come from the 5′ end of the growing strand rather than from free nucleotides. The problem is that if the high energy triphosphates were on the growing strand and not on the free nucleotides, proof-reading by removing a mismatched terminal nucleotide would be problematic: Once a nucleotide is added, the triphosphate is lost and a single phosphate remains on the backbone between the new nucleotide and the rest of the strand. If the added nucleotide were mismatched, removal would result in a DNA strand terminated by a monophosphate at the end of the ""growing strand"" rather than a high energy triphosphate. So strand would be stuck and wouldn't be able to grow anymore. In actuality, the high energy triphosphates hydrolyzed at each step originate from the free nucleotides, not the polymerized strand, so this issue does not exist.

These proteins implement all the functions of a living organism and determine the organism's characteristics. When the cell reproduces, it must pass all of this information on to the daughter cells. Before a cell can reproduce, it must first replicate — or make a copy of — its DNA. Where DNA replication occurs depends upon whether the cell is a or a eukaryote. DNA replication occurs in the cytoplasm of prokaryotes and in the nucleus of eukaryotes. Regardless of where DNA replication occurs, the basic process is the same. Advertisement The structure of DNA lends itself easily to DNA replication. Each side of the double helix runs in opposite (antiparallel) directions.

0,khanacademy,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-biology/gene-expression-and-regulation/replication/a/molecular-mechanism-of-dna-replication,"DNA in the 5' to 3' direction.During DNA replication, one new strand (the leading strand) is made as a continuous piece. The other (the lagging strand) is made in small pieces.DNA replication requires other enzymes in addition to DNA polymerase, including DNA primase, DNA helicase, DNA ligase, and topoisomerase.IntroductionDNA replication, or the copying of a cell's DNA, is no simple task! There are about 3333 billion\text{billion}billionstart text, b, i, l, l, i, o, n, end text base pairs of DNA in your genome, all of which must be accurately copied when any one of your trillions of cells divides1^11start superscript, 1, end superscript.The basic mechanisms of DNA replication are similar across organisms. In this article, we'll focus on DNA replication as it takes place in the bacterium E. coli, but the mechanisms of replication are similar in humans and other eukaryotes.Let's take a look at the proteins and enzymes that carry out replication, seeing how they work together to ensure accurate and complete replication of DNA.The basic ideaDNA replication is semiconservative, meaning that each strand in the DNA double helix acts as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand.This process takes us from one starting molecule to two ""daughter"" molecules, with each newly formed double helix containing one new and one old strand.Schematic of Watson and Crick's basic model of DNA replication.DNA double helix.Hydrogen bonds break and helix opens.Each strand of DNA acts as a template for synthesis of a new, complementary strand.Replication produces two identical DNA double helices, each with one new and one old strand. In a sense, that's all there is to DNA replication! But what's actually most interesting about this process is how it's carried out in a cell.Cells need to copy their DNA very quickly, and with very few errors (or risk problems such as cancer). To do so, they use a variety of enzymes and proteins, which work together to make sure DNA replication is performed smoothly and accurately.DNA polymeraseOne of the key molecules in DNA replication is the enzyme DNA polymerase. DNA polymerases are responsible for synthesizing DNA: they add nucleotides one by one to the growing DNA chain, incorporating only those that are complementary to the template.Two strands of D N A are base paired together. The top strand consists of a 5 prime end, labeled primer, and a 3 prime end that is growing and labeled new D N A strand. The bottom strand runs from 3 prime to 5 prime and is labeled old D N A strand. The growing portion of the top strand and the corresponding portion of the bottom strand are surrounded by D N A polymerase. A magnified view of this portion shows a bottom strand sequence of C T T A G T G A C and a top strand sequence of G A A T C A C with an arrow showing that T is inserted next.Here are some key features of DNA polymerases:They always need a templateThey can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of a DNA strandThey can't start making a DNA chain from scratch, but require a pre-existing chain or short stretch of nucleotides called a primerThey proofread, or check their work, removing the vast majority of ""wrong"" nucleotides that are accidentally added to the chainThe addition of nucleotides requires energy. This energy comes from the nucleotides themselves, which have three phosphates attached to them (much like the energy-carrying molecule ATP). When the bond between phosphates is broken, the energy released is used to form a bond between the incoming nucleotide and the growing chain. In prokaryotes such as E. coli, there are two main DNA polymerases involved in DNA replication: DNA pol III (the major DNA-maker), and DNA pol I, which plays a crucial supporting role we'll examine later.Starting DNA replicationHow do DNA polymerases and other replication factors know where to begin? Replication always starts at specific locations on the DNA, which are called origins of replication and are recognized by their sequence.E. coli, like most bacteria, has a single origin of replication on its chromosome. The origin is about 245245245245 base pairs long and has mostly A/T base pairs (which are held together by fewer hydrogen bonds than G/C base pairs), making the DNA strands easier to separate.Specialized proteins recognize the origin, bind to this site, and open up the DNA. As the DNA opens, two Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed, together making up what's called a replication bubble. The replication forks will move in opposite directions as replication proceeds. Bacterial chromosome. The double-stranded DNA of the circular bacteria chromosome is opened at the origin of replication, forming a replication bubble. Each end of the bubble is a replication fork, a Y-shaped junction where double-stranded DNA is separated into two single strands. New DNA complementary to each single strand is synthesized at each replication fork. The two forks move in opposite directions around the circumference of the bacterial chromosome, creating a larger and larger replication bubble that grows at both ends. Diagram based on similar illustration in Reece et al. 2^22squared.How does replication actually get going at the forks? Helicase is the first replication enzyme to load on at the origin of replication3^33cubed. Helicase's job is to move the replication forks forward by ""unwinding"" the DNA (breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs). Proteins called single-strand binding proteins coat the separated strands of DNA near the replication fork, keeping them from coming back together into a double helix.Primers and primaseDNA polymerases can only add nucleotides to the 3' end of an existing DNA strand. (They use the free -OH group found at the 3' end as a ""hook,"" adding a nucleotide to this group in the polymerization reaction.) How, then, does DNA polymerase add the first nucleotide at a new replication fork?Alone, it can't! The problem is solved with the help of an enzyme called primase. Primase makes an RNA primer, or short stretch of nucleic acid complementary to the template, that provides a 3' end for DNA polymerase to work on. A typical primer is about five to ten nucleotides long. The primer primes DNA synthesis, i.e., gets it started.Once the RNA primer is in place, DNA polymerase ""extends"" it, adding nucleotides one by one to make a new DNA strand that's complementary to the template strand.Leading and lagging strandsIn E. coli, the DNA polymerase that handles most of the synthesis is DNA polymerase III. There are two molecules of DNA polymerase III at a replication fork, each of them hard at work on one of the two new DNA strands.DNA polymerases can only make DNA in the 5' to 3' direction, and this poses a problem during replication. A DNA double helix is always anti-parallel; in other words, one strand runs in the 5' to 3' direction, while the other runs in the 3' to 5' direction. This makes it necessary for the two new strands, which are also antiparallel to their templates, to be made in slightly different ways.One new strand, which runs 5' to 3' towards the replication fork, is the easy one. This strand is made continuously, because the DNA polymerase is moving in the same direction as the replication fork. This continuously synthesized strand is called the leading strand.A diagram showing D N A replication. Separated double strand D N A is shown in black. The top black strand runs 3 prime to 5 prime and is attached to a leading strand that is growing from 5 prime to 3 prime due to D N A polymerase moving towards the 3 prime end of the leading strand. The 5 prime end of this strand is yellow and the remainder is blue. The bottom black strand runs 5 prime to 3 prime and is attached to the lagging strand, which consists of a pair of Okazaki fragments that run in the opposite direction. The 5 prime end of each of these fragments is yellow and the remainder of each fragment is blue. D N A polymerase moves towards the 3 prime end of the right hand Okazaki fragment and is nearing the gap between fragments.The other new strand, which runs 5' to 3' away from the fork, is trickier. This strand is made in fragments because, as the fork moves forward, the DNA polymerase (which is moving away from the fork) must come off and reattach on the newly exposed DNA. This tricky strand, which is made in fragments, is called the lagging strand.The small fragments are called Okazaki fragments, named for the Japanese scientist who discovered them. The leading strand can be extended from one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments.The maintenance and cleanup crew Some other proteins and enzymes, in addition the main ones above, are needed to keep DNA replication running smoothly. One is a protein called the sliding clamp, which holds DNA polymerase III molecules in place as they synthesize DNA. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein and keeps the DNA polymerase of the lagging strand from floating off when it re-starts at a new Okazaki fragment4^44start superscript, 4, end superscript.Topoisomerase also plays an important maintenance role during DNA replication. This enzyme prevents the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork from getting too tightly wound as the DNA is opened up. It acts by making temporary nicks in the helix to release the tension, then sealing the nicks to avoid permanent damage.Finally, there is a little cleanup work to do if we want DNA that doesn't contain any RNA or gaps. The RNA primers are removed and replaced by DNA through the activity of DNA polymerase I, the other polymerase involved in replication. The nicks that remain after the primers are replaced get sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase.Summary of DNA replication in E. coliLet's zoom out and see how the enzymes and proteins involved in replication work together to synthesize new DNA. Illustration shows the replication fork. Helicase unwinds the helix, and single-strand binding proteins prevent the helix from re-forming. Topoisomerase prevents the DNA from getting too tightly coiled ahead of the replication fork. DNA primase forms an RNA primer, and DNA polymerase extends the DNA strand from the RNA primer. DNA synthesis occurs only in the 5' to 3' direction. On the leading strand, DNA synthesis occurs continuously. On the lagging strand, DNA synthesis restarts many times as the helix unwinds, resulting in many short fragments called “Okazaki fragments.” DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together into a single DNA molecule.Helicase opens up the DNA at the replication fork.Single-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA.Topoisomerase works at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling.Primase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand.DNA polymerase III extends the primers, adding on to the 3' end, to make the bulk of the new DNA.RNA primers are removed and replaced with DNA by DNA polymerase I.The gaps between DNA fragments are sealed by DNA ligase.DNA replication in eukaryotesThe basics of DNA replication are similar between bacteria and eukaryotes such as humans, but there are also some differences:Eukaryotes usually have multiple linear chromosomes, each with multiple origins of replication.

The elucidation of the structure of the double helix provided a hint as to how DNA is copied. Recall that adenine nucleotides pair with thymine nucleotides, and cytosine with guanine. This means that the two strands are complementary to each other. For example, a strand of DNA with a nucleotide sequence of AGTCATGA will have a complementary strand with the sequence TCAGTACT (Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\)). Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\): The two strands of DNA are complementary, meaning the sequence of bases in one strand can be used to create the correct sequence of bases in the other strand. Because of the complementarity of the two strands, having one strand means that it is possible to recreate the other strand. This model for replication suggests that the two strands of the double helix separate during replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied (Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\)). Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\): The semiconservative model of DNA replication is shown. Gray indicates the original DNA strands, and blue indicates newly synthesized DNA. During DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. Each new double strand consists of one parental strand and one new daughter strand. This is known as semiconservative replication. When two DNA copies are formed, they have an identical sequence of nucleotide bases and are divided equally into two daughter cells. DNA Replication in Eukaryotes Because eukaryotic genomes are very complex, DNA replication is a very complicated process that involves several enzymes and other proteins. It occurs in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. Recall that eukaryotic DNA is bound to proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. During initiation, the DNA is made accessible to the proteins and enzymes involved in the replication process. How does the replication machinery know where on the DNA double helix to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication at which replication begins. Certain proteins bind to the origin of replication while an enzyme called helicase unwinds and opens up the DNA helix. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed (Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\)). Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication, and these get extended in both directions as replication proceeds. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome, such that replication can occur simultaneously from several places in the genome. During elongation, an enzyme called DNA polymerase adds DNA nucleotides to the 3' end of the template. Because DNA polymerase can only add new nucleotides at the end of a backbone, a primer sequence, which provides this starting point, is added with complementary RNA nucleotides. This primer is removed later, and the nucleotides are replaced with DNA nucleotides. One strand, which is complementary to the parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork so the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in a 5' to 3' direction, the other new strand is put together in short pieces called Okazaki fragments. The Okazaki fragments each require a primer made of RNA to start the synthesis. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand. As synthesis proceeds, an enzyme removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides, and the gaps between fragments are sealed by an enzyme called DNA ligase. The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows: DNA unwinds at the origin of replication. New bases are added to the complementary parental strands. One new strand is made continuously, while the other strand is made in pieces. Primers are removed, new DNA nucleotides are put in place of the primers and the backbone is sealed by DNA ligase. ART CONNECTION Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\): A replication fork is formed by the opening of the origin of replication, and helicase separates the DNA strands. An RNA primer is synthesized, and is elongated by the DNA polymerase. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches. The DNA fragments are joined by DNA ligase (not shown). You isolate a cell strain in which the joining together of Okazaki fragments is impaired and suspect that a mutation has occurred in an enzyme found at the replication fork. Which enzyme is most likely to be mutated? Telomere Replication Because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, DNA replication comes to the end of a line in eukaryotic chromosomes. As you have learned, the DNA polymerase enzyme can add nucleotides in only one direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached; however, on the lagging strand there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. This presents a problem for the cell because the ends remain unpaired, and over time these ends get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that do not code for a particular gene. As a consequence, it is telomeres that are shortened with each round of DNA replication instead of genes. For example, in humans, a six base-pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (Figure \(\PageIndex{4}\)) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the end of the DNA strand. Once the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can now add nucleotides that are complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated. Figure \(\PageIndex{4}\): The ends of linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme. Telomerase is typically found to be active in germ cells, adult stem cells, and some cancer cells. For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (Figure \(\PageIndex{5}\)) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 2009. Figure \(\PageIndex{5}\): Elizabeth Blackburn, 2009 Nobel Laureate, was the scientist who discovered how telomerase works. (credit: U.S. Embassy, Stockholm, Sweden) Telomerase is not active in adult somatic cells. Adult somatic cells that undergo cell division continue to have their telomeres shortened. This essentially means that telomere shortening is associated with aging. In 2010, scientists found that telomerase can reverse some age-related conditions in mice, and this may have potential in regenerative medicine. Telomerase-deficient mice were used in these studies; these mice have tissue atrophy, stem-cell depletion, organ system failure, and impaired tissue injury responses. Telomerase reactivation in these mice caused extension of telomeres, reduced DNA damage, reversed neurodegeneration, and improved functioning of the testes, spleen, and intestines. Thus, telomere reactivation may have potential for treating age-related diseases in humans. DNA Replication in Prokaryotes Recall that the prokaryotic chromosome is a circular molecule with a less extensive coiling structure than eukaryotic chromosomes. The eukaryotic chromosome is linear and highly coiled around proteins. While there are many similarities in the DNA replication process, these structural differences necessitate some differences in the DNA replication process in these two life forms. DNA replication has been extremely well-studied in prokaryotes, primarily because of the small size of the genome and large number of variants available. Escherichia coli has 4.6 million base pairs in a single circular chromosome, and all of it gets replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the chromosome in both directions. This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is much more rapid than in eukaryotes. Table \(\PageIndex{1}\) summarizes the differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic replications. Table \(\PageIndex{1}\): Differences between Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Replications Property Prokaryotes Eukaryotes Origin of replication Single Multiple Rate of replication 1000 nucleotides/s 50 to 100 nucleotides/s Chromosome structure circular linear Telomerase Not present Present CONCEPT IN ACTION Click through a on DNA replication. DNA Repair DNA polymerase can make mistakes while adding nucleotides. It edits the DNA by proofreading every newly added base. Incorrect bases are removed and replaced by the correct base, and then polymerization continues (Figure \(\PageIndex{6}\)a). Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base (Figure \(\PageIndex{6}\)b). In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the DNA double strand is unwound and separated, the incorrect bases are removed along with a few bases on the 5' and 3' end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase (Figure \(\PageIndex{6}\)c). Nucleotide excision repair is particularly important in correcting thymine dimers, which are primarily caused by ultraviolet light. In a thymine dimer, two thymine nucleotides adjacent to each other on one strand are covalently bonded to each other rather than their complementary bases. If the dimer is not removed and repaired it will lead to a mutation. Individuals with flaws in their nucleotide excision repair genes show extreme sensitivity to sunlight and develop skin cancers early in life. Figure \(\PageIndex{6}\): Proofreading by DNA polymerase (a) corrects errors during replication. In mismatch repair (b), the incorrectly added base is detected after replication. The mismatch repair proteins detect this base and remove it from the newly synthesized strand by nuclease action. The gap is now filled with the correctly paired base. Nucleotide excision (c) repairs thymine dimers. When exposed to UV, thymines lying adjacent to each other can form thymine dimers. In normal cells, they are excised and replaced. Most mistakes are corrected; if they are not, they may result in a mutation—defined as a permanent change in the DNA sequence. Mutations in repair genes may lead to serious consequences like cancer. Summary DNA replicates by a semi-conservative method in which each of the two parental DNA strands act as a template for new DNA to be synthesized. After replication, each DNA has one parental or “old” strand, and one daughter or “new” strand. Replication in eukaryotes starts at multiple origins of replication, while replication in prokaryotes starts from a single origin of replication. The DNA is opened with enzymes, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides in only one direction. One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with DNA ligase. The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes pose a problem, as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected. Cells have mechanisms for repairing DNA when it becomes damaged or errors are made in replication. These mechanisms include mismatch repair to replace nucleotides that are paired with a non-complementary base and nucleotide excision repair, which removes bases that are damaged such as thymine dimers.

This passing of DNA and the genetic information stored in DNA is known as “Genetic Continuity”. The replication of DNA is crucial to ensuring genetic continuity both during cell division and between parents and offspring during reproduction. The Process of DNA Replication 1) Double Helix Unwinding The first step of DNA replication is unwinding of the DNA double helix. Because DNA is a base-paired double helix, it replicates itself by unwinding and using each of its strands as a template to form a new strand. Hydrogen bonds are broken during unwinding. There is breakage of hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs on the two polynucleotide chains. An enzyme called DNA helicase is involved. DNA helicase unwinds the DNA by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs on the two strands of DNA. It is important to understand that the entire DNA does not unwind simultaneously. DNA replication occurs along an entire molecule of DNA and the unwinding happens in one region of the molecule at a time. This is done to ensure stability of the molecule. The unwound region of the DNA is called a “replication fork”. DNA gets unwound in one direction only, meaning the replication fork moves continuously in a unilateral direction. A-level Biology – DNA Replication 2) Semi-Conservative Replication DNA replication is semiconservative. The original strands of DNA act as a template for the synthesis of new strands of DNA. So each new DNA molecule is made up of one parent strand (see next point) from the original DNA molecule, and one new, daughter strand. A-level Biology – DNA Replication The unwound strands of DNA are referred to as the parental strands. Free floating nucleotides in the nucleus are attracted to these parental strands of DNA. 3) DNA Polymerase (Condensation Reactions) Condensation reactions occur to complete DNA replication. The newly attracted nucleotides are only hydrogen bonded with the parental strand. To create a new strand of DNA, condensation reactions between these nucleotides need to occur in order to synthesise the daughter polynucleotide chain in order to complete DNA replication. DNA polymerase is the key enzyme. These condensation reactions are catalysed by the enzyme DNA polymerase, which reads the nucleotides and enables them to join. DNA ligase is responsible for the actual condensation reaction. Mechanism of DNA Polymerase In a DNA double helix, the two strands are antiparallel. We previously established how in DNA, one strands goes from 3’ to 5’, and the opposite strand goes from 5’ to 3’. DNA polymerase Works in the 5′ to 3′ direction DNA polymerase catalyses addition of free nucleotides. DNA polymerase “reads” the parental strand, and catalyses the addition of the free-floating nucleotides. DNA polymerase starts building at the 5’ end of the daughter strand. DNA polymerase can only bind to the 3′ end of a parental strand and work in one direction. This means they build the new strand in the 5′ to 3′ direction only. One of the daughter strands will be the leading strand. Since DNA strands are antiparallel but DNA polymerase can only work in one direction, replication has to occur in opposite directions on the two strands. Remember that DNA is also being unwound in one direction only too. The daughter strand which will go in the 5′ to 3′ direction towards the replication fork can be made continuously because the DNA polymerase can move continuously in this direction and follow the replication fork. This strand is called the leading strand. The other daughter strand will be the lagging strand. The other daughter strand will run 5′ to 3′ away from the replication fork. This strand cannot be made continuously as DNA polymerase can only build the new strand in opposite direction. Thus, DNA polymerase will need to keep detaching and reattaching to this strand, and this results in the new strand being built in short segments. This strand is called the lagging strand. A-level Biology – DNA Replication DNA polymerase reads and DNA ligase catalyses DNA polymerase reads the nucleotide sequence. When DNA polymerase binds to the parental DNA it reads the nucleotide sequence and recruits complementary nucleotides to form a hydrogen bond with the parental nucleotide. In doing so, DNA polymerase carries out a “proofreading” activity. It makes sure that only complementary nucleotides are pairing in order to prevent mutations from happening. DNA ligase catalyses condensation reactions. As the DNA polymerase recruits new nucleotides, DNA ligase catalyses condensation reactions between the new nucleotides to create a polynucleotide chain. A-level Biology – DNA Replication →What is DNA Replication? DNA Replication is the process of making a copy of the genetic information contained in DNA. This process is necessary for cell division and the transfer of genetic information from one generation to the next. →How does DNA Replication occur? DNA Replication occurs through the semi-conservative mechanism, where each strand of the DNA double helix acts as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand. The DNA strands separate, and each strand is used as a template to build a new complementary strand by the addition of nucleotides. →What are the enzymes involved in DNA Replication? The main enzymes involved in DNA Replication are helicase, primase, DNA polymerase, and ligase. helicase unwinds the double helix, primase synthesizes RNA primers, DNA polymerase adds nucleotides to the template strand, and ligase seals the gaps between the nucleotides. →What is the role of RNA primers in DNA Replication? RNA primers are short stretches of RNA that are synthesized by primase and are used to initiate DNA Replication. The primers provide a starting point for the addition of nucleotides by DNA polymerase. Once the primer is in place, the DNA"
0,mechanobio,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://www.mechanobio.info/genome-regulation/how-is-dna-replicated/,"DNA replicates in the S phase of the cell cycle and initiates at specific regions in the DNA sequence known as DNA replication ‘origins’. A number of proteins participate in DNA replication and the process is subject to scrutiny by cell surveillance mechanisms called cell cycle checkpoints. These checkpoints ensure that replication of DNA occurs just once per cell cycle. Defects in DNA replication could give rise to damaging mutations including those that cause cancer. The Initiation of DNA replication The stage for DNA replication is set in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and DNA is synthesized in the S phase. DNA replication is initiated at specific sites in the genome known as the ‘origins’ which are recognized and bound by origin binding proteins. Replication commences at a single origin in prokaryotes and at multiple origins in eukaryotes, however, the basic mechanism of replication is conserved in all organisms . In eukaryotes, initiator proteins , and recruit the replicative helicase . The eukaryotic replicative helicase is a complex of proteins called the CMG helicase consisting of , and proteins . This assembly of the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC) at origins during G1 phase is called ‘origin licensing’ FIG. The helicase is inactive in the pre-RC and is activated only in the S phase when origins ‘fire’ due to the activity of / kinases , . Once origins fire, DNA synthesis begins and the initiator proteins are degraded or exported out of the nucleus to prevent re-replication . The precise mechanisms of origin licensing and origin firing in two separate phases of the cell-cycle ensure that DNA replication occurs only once per cell-cycle. DNA synthesis The mechanism of DNA replication is greatly influenced by DNA structure. The complementary base pairing between the nitrogen bases A-T and G-C underlies the semi-conservative nature of DNA replication, which results in a duplicated genome with one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. Each strand serves as a template for the to catalyze the addition of the correct base during synthesis of a new complementary strand. As the strands are antiparallel with opposing polarity and since DNA polymerases can only synthesize DNA in the 5′ to 3′ direction, only one strand is continuously synthesized. This strand is called the leading strand. Synthesis of the other strand, called the lagging strand, is made possible through discontinuous synthesis of short fragments, called Okazaki fragments, in the 5′ to 3′ direction, which are later joined together. The replicating DNA: DNA replication proteins at the replication fork. The helicase unwinds the duplex DNA and Single Strand Binding proteins (SSBs) coat and stabilize single stranded DNA formed by strand separation. Topoisomerase is seen ahead of the fork removing superhelical tension caused by strand separation. Note that the leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5′ to 3′ direction, whereas the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as short fragments called Okazaki fragments. The Polymerase α-primase complex synthesizes short RNA primers that are extended up to 30-40 nucleotides. Thereafter polymerase ε and polymerase δ takes up the job of faster and efficient strand synthesis on lagging and leading strands respectively. Ligase seals the gap between Okazaki fragments. DNA synthesis begins in S phase as the replicative helicase unwinds and separates the two strands of the DNA double helix . As the helicase unwinds DNA, DNA polymerase synthesizes DNA utilizing the exposed single stranded DNA as a template. DNA polymerases ‘read’ the template strand and add the correct complimentary base. Energy for polymerization comes from release of a pyrophosphate from a free deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), creating a 5′monophosphate that could be covalently linked to the 3′ hydroxyl group of another nucleotide. However, DNA polymerases cannot synthesize DNA de novo and require a preexisting primer with a free hydroxyl group to add nucleotides and extend the chain. A specialized RNA polymerase called synthesizes short RNA sequences about 10 nucleotides long which serve as primers. A single primer aids DNA replication on the leading strand and multiple primers initiate okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand. In Eukaryotes, the primase is part of the (reviewed in ). The replicative helicase and primase functionally co-operate and stimulate each other’s activity . After DNA polymerase α has synthesized a short, 30-40 nucleotide stretch of DNA, further DNA synthesis is handed over to and which have a higher processivity than polymerase α. The higher processivity or the ability of the polymerases to stay associated with DNA for upto 10kb without falling off is due to their association with a sliding clamp called PCNA. The polymerase switching enables DNA synthesis with high fidelity as polymerase ε and polymerase δ have a 3′ – 5′ exonuclease activity which enables proof reading and removal of any incorrect bases that is incorporated (reviewed in ). At the replication fork, there is a division of labor between the polymerases where polymerase ε carries out leading strand synthesis and polymerase δ is involved in the synthesis of the lagging strand , 12) Okazaki fragment maturation and replication termination The Okazaki fragments which are about 100-200bp in eukaryotes are ligated together in a process known as Okazaki fragment maturation to complete DNA synthesis. , as it runs into the adjacent Okazaki fragment ahead of polymerization removes 2 to 3 nucleotides of the RNA primer thereby generating a short flap that is processed by . This leaves a nick that is sealed by . Although there are well-defined replications termination sequences called Ter sites in prokaryotes, in eukaryotes, termination typically occurs by the collision of two replication forks. DNA Replication: a mechanobiology perspective DNA replication begins with the unwrapping and unwinding of the highly compacted chromatin structure. The two strands of the double helix must also be separated before the replication machinery can access and copy each strand. Specialized ATPase motor proteins called helicases catalyze DNA unwinding by translocating along the DNA substrate and separating the base pairs . Model showing ATR-mediated checkpoint in response to mechanical stress created by DNA replication at the nuclear envelope: a) Nucleus showing DNA (dark blue strands) with regions tethered to the nuclear envelope b) Mechanical stress (red bar) created at the nuclear envelope by replicating DNA (red strands) c) Recruitment of ATR to the nuclear envelope transiently detaches DNA from the nuclear envelope allowing for completion of DNA replication. d) Nucleus showing newly replicated DNA (Adapted from Kumar et al, ATR mediates a checkpoint at the nuclear envelope in response to mechanical stress, Cell, 2014) As DNA unwinding and DNA synthesis progresses, the DNA ahead of the replication fork becomes overwound or positively supercoiled. This creates superhelical tension which is usually resolved by enzymes known as . However, the super helical tension is higher in longer chromosomes and in regions of the chromatin tethered to the nuclear envelope (reviewed in ). It is now evident that the torsional stress from the replication forks impinge on the nuclear envelope in the form of mechanical signals that recruit , a DNA damage checkpoint protein, independent of its role in DNA repair . ATR may then enable transient detachment of chromatin from the nuclear envelope, thus allowing for the completion of replication . ATR is also recruited during prophase to resolve the topological stress arising from chromatin condensation and is required for coordinating DNA replication and chromatin condensation. Aside from mechanical forces generated within the cell as a result of DNA replication itself, DNA replication may also be affected by external forces acting on the cell. It is well-known that external forces transduce to the nucleus via cytoskeletal links and affects gene regulation as well as organization of chromosomes . Therefore understanding DNA replication requires a mechanobiology perspective, incorporating the physical challenges of DNA packaging and unwinding as well as mechanical forces that influence DNA replication. ×More Questions FAQ How is DNA packed inside the nucleus?2018-01-17T12:47:16+08:30 A series of processes must take place that enable the cell to package DNA within the confines of the nucleus whilst retaining its ability to transcribe and duplicate the entire DNA sequence and maintain its integrity. This is achieved through an elaborate process of DNA condensation that sees DNA packaged into 46 chromosomes (or 23 chromosome pairs) in humans. How is translation terminated?2017-12-19T16:53:50+08:30 The next step in the process of translation is termination. In this step an mRNA stop codon indicates that no additional amino acids are to be added to the growing protein. How are ribosomes recycled during translation?2017-12-19T16:50:22+08:30 The final step in translation is ribosome recycling, which sees the ribosome split into its smaller subunit parts and prepare for another round of translation. In eukaryotes this means the 80S ribosome splits into its 40S and 60S subunits. What happens during the elongation stage of translation?2017-12-19T16:46:46+08:30 Elongation occurs over several well-defined steps, beginning with the recognition of the mRNA codons by their corresponding aminoacyl-tRNA. Association with the mRNA occurs via the ribosomal A site and is influenced by various elongation factors. How is translation initiated?2017-12-19T16:43:25+08:30 The first step in translation is known as initiation. Here, the large (60S) and small (40S) ribosomal units are assembled into a fully functional 80S ribosome. This is positioned at the start codon (AUG) of the mRNA strand to be translated. What is translation?2017-12-19T16:02:08+08:30 Translation is a process that involves the synthesis of an amino acid chain from an mRNA blueprint. These polypeptide chains fold into functional proteins. What is euchromatin and heterochromatin?2017-12-19T15:44:10+08:30 Traditionally, chromatin is classified as either euchromatin or heterochromatin, depending on its level of compaction. Euchromatin has a less compact structure, and is often described as a 11 nm fiber that has the appearance of ‘beads on a string’ where the beads represent nucleosomes and the string represents DNA. In contrast, heterochromatin is more compact, and is often reported as being composed of a nucleosome array condensed into a 30 nm fiber. What are transcription factories?2017-12-19T15:21:33+08:30 Despite 20,000 genes being present in each haploid nucleus, the number of transcription foci is limited to around 2000. These transcription foci, also known as transcriptional factories are distinct submicron nuclear regions that are associated with nascent RNA production and are enriched in RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) complexes. What are telomeres?2017-12-19T15:14:11+08:30 Telomeres are short nucleotide sequences found at the end of linear chromosomes which protect the genetic information. In vertebrates, telomeres have the hexameric sequence TTAGGG. What are the various models describing the structural organization of chromosome territories?2017-12-19T14:32:09+08:30 With the development of high-throughput biochemical techniques, such as 3C (‘chromosome conformation capture’) and 4C (‘chromosome conformation capture-on-chip’ and ‘circular chromosome conformation capture’), numerous spatial interactions between neighbouring chromatin territories have been described. Together, these observations and physical simulations have led to the proposal of various models that aim to define the structural organization of chromosome territories. How is transcription regulated in stem cells?2017-12-19T13:59:25+08:30 Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent in early organism development, but gradually undergo lineage restriction and transform into the stem cells with limited differentiation capacities (e.g., hematopoietic stem cells, neural stem cells). How is the nucleus maintained in a prestressed state?2017-12-19T12:40:18+08:30 As an integral part of cellular behavior, cells are sensitive to matrix rigidity, local geometry and stress or strain applied by external factors. In recent years, it has been established that an extensive network of protein assembly couples the cytoskeleton to the nucleus and that condensation forces of the chromatin balance cytoskeletal forces resulting in a prestressed nuclear organization. What are the stages in DNA replication?2017-12-18T16:17:47+08:30 Cells must replicate their DNA before they can divide. This ensures that each daughter cell gets a copy of the genome, and therefore, successful inheritance of genetic traits. DNA replication is an essential process and the basic mechanism is conserved in all organisms. How does chromatin remodeling regulate gene transcription?2017-12-18T15:53:34+08:30 While chromosome territory dynamics is believed to regulate gene expression through the redistribution of genes and the subsequent co-localization of these genes with transcription machinery, changes are also commonly made to the chromosome structure at a ‘local’ level. Although these changes do not necessarily involve the redistribution of genes, they do have a significant influence on gene regulation. How do chromosome territory dynamics regulate gene expression?2017-12-18T15:22:28+08:30 The spatial organization of chromatin within the 3-dimensional space of a chromosome territory enables the co-localization of co-transcribed genes and their transcriptional foci. Many gene positioning studies have shown that individual genes often loop out of their chromosomal territory to co-localize with transcription factories. What is the chromatin polymer model of chromosome territory organization?2018-01-19T15:08:09+08:30 The chromatin polymer models assume a broad range of chromatin loop sizes and predict the observed distances between genomic loci and chromosome territories, as well as the probabilities of contacts being formed between given loci. These models apply physics-based approaches that highlight the importance of entropy for understanding nuclear organization… What is the Fraser and Bickmore model of chromosome territory organization?2018-01-19T15:06:27+08:30 The Fraser and Bickmore model emphasizes the functional importance of giant chromatin loops, which originate from chromosome territories and expand across the nuclear space in order to share transcription factories. In this case, both cis- and trans- loops of decondensed chromatin can be co-expressed and co-regulated by the same transcription factory… What is the interchromatin network (ICN) model of chromosome territory organization?2018-01-19T15:12:33+08:30 The interchromatin network (ICN) model of chromosome territory organization predicts that intermingling chromatin fibers/loops can make both cis- (within the same chromosome) and trans- (between different chromosomes) contacts. This intermingling is uniform and makes distinction between the chromosome territory and interchromatin compartment functionally meaningless… What models describe chromosome territories?2018-01-19T15:13:49+08:30 With the development of high-throughput biochemical techniques, such as 3C (‘chromosome conformation capture’) and 4C (‘chromosome conformation capture-on-chip’ and ‘circular chromosome conformation capture’), numerous spatial interactions between neighbouring chromatin territories have been described. These descriptions have been supplemented with the construction of spatial proximity maps for the entire genome (e.g., for a human lymphoblastoid cell line). Together, these observations and physical simulations have led to the proposal of various models that aim to define the structural organization of chromosome territories… What are chromosome territories?2017-12-19T14:06:59+08:30 During interphase, each chromosome occupies a spatially limited, roughly elliptical domain which is known as a chromosome territory (CT). Each chromosome territory is comprised of higher order chromatin units of ~1 Mb each. These units are likely built up from smaller loop domains. What are nucleosomes?2017-12-19T14:52:22+08:30 In order to fit DNA into the nucleus, it must be packaged into a highly compacted structure known as chromatin. In the first step of this process DNA is condensed into a 11 nm fiber that represents an approximate 6-fold level of compaction. This is achieved through nucleosome assembly. How is DNA packed inside the nucleus?2017-12-19T15:34:48+08:30 A series of processes must take place that enable the cell to package DNA within the confines of the nucleus whilst retaining its ability to transcribe and duplicate the entire DNA sequence and maintain its integrity. This is achieved through an elaborate process of DNA condensation that sees DNA"

Knowledge of DNA’s structure helped scientists understand DNA replication, the process by which DNA is copied. It occurs during the synthesis (S) phase of the eukaryotic cell cycle. DNA must be copied so that each new daughter cell will have a complete set of chromosomes after cell division occurs. DNA replication is referred to as “semi-conservative”. What this means is when a strand of DNA is replicated, each of the two original strands acts as a template for a new complementary strand. When the replication process is complete, there are two identical sets of DNA, each containing one of the original strands of DNA, and one newly synthesized strand. DNA replication involves a certain sequence of events. For each event, there is a specific enzyme which facilitates the process. There are four main enzymes that facilitate DNA replication: helicase, primase, DNA polymerase, and ligase. DNA Replication: The Process DNA replication begins when an enzyme called helicase unwinds, and unzips the DNA molecule. If you recall the structure of DNA, you may remember that it consists of two long strands of nucleotides held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary nitrogenous bases. This forms a ladder-like structure which is in a coiled shape. In order to start DNA replication, helicase needs to unwind the molecule and break apart the hydrogen bonds holding together complementary nitrogenous bases. This causes the two strands of DNA to separate. Small molecules called single-stranded binding proteins (SSB) attach to the loose strands of DNA to keep them from re-forming the hydrogen bonds that helicase just broke apart. Figure 5.4.2 Helicase unwinds and unzips the DNA molecule. SSB keep the two strands from re-attaching to one another. Once the nitrogenous bases from the inside of the DNA molecule are exposed, the creation of a new, complementary strand can begin. DNA polymerase creates the new strand, but it needs some help in finding the correct place to begin, so primase lays down a short section of RNA primer (shown in green in Figure 5.4.3). Once this short section of primer is laid, DNA polymerase can bind to the DNA molecule and start connecting nucleotides in the correct order to match the sequence of nitrogenous bases on the template (original) strand. Figure 5.4.3 DNA Replication. DNA replication is a semi-conservative process. Half of the parent DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two daughter DNA molecules. Figure 5.4.4 The two strands of nucleotides that make up DNA run antiparallel to one another. Note in the left-hand strand the phosphate group is in the “up” position, and in the right-hand strand, the phosphate group is in the “down” position. If we think about the DNA molecule, we may remember that the two strands of DNA run antiparallel to one another. This means that in the sugar-phosphate backbone, one strand of the DNA has the sugar oriented in the “up” position, and the other strand has the phosphate oriented in the “up” position (see Figure 5.4.4). DNA polymerase is an enzyme which can only work in one direction on the DNA molecule. This means that one strand of DNA can be replicated in one long string, as DNA polymerase follows helicase as it unzips the DNA molecule. This strand is termed the “leading strand”. The other strand, however, can only be replicated in small chunks since the DNA polymerase replicates in the opposite direction that helicase is unzipping. This strand is termed the “lagging strand”. These small chunks of replicated DNA on the lagging strand are called Okazaki fragments. Take a look at Figure 5.4.5 and find the Okazaki fragments, the leading strand and the lagging strand. Figure 5.4.5 DNA polymerase can only synthesize new DNA in one direction on the template strand. This results in one set of DNA being replicated in one long strand (the leading strand) and one replicated in small chunks called Okazaki fragments (the lagging strand). Once DNA polymerase has replicated the DNA, a third enzyme called ligase completes the final stage of DNA replication, which is repairing the sugar-phosphate backbone. This connects the gaps in the backbone between Okazaki fragments. Once this is complete, the DNA coils back into its classic double helix structure. Semi-Conservative Replication When DNA replication is complete, there are two identical sets of double stranded DNA, each with one strand from the original, template, DNA molecule, and one strand that was newly synthesized during the DNA replication process. Because each new set of DNA contains one old and one new strand, we describe DNA as being semi-conservative. Watch this video for a great overview of DNA replication: DNA Replication (Updated), Amoeba Sisters, 2019. 5.4 Summary DNA replication requires the action of three main enzymes each with their own specific role: Helicase unzips and unwinds the DNA molecule. DNA polymerase creates a new complementary strand of DNA on each of the originals halves that were separated by helicase. New nucleotides are added through complementary base pairing: A pairs with T, and C with G. Ligase repairs gaps in the sugar-phosphate backbone between Okazaki fragments. DNA replication is semi-conservative because each daughter molecule contains one strand from the parent molecule and one new complementary strand. 5.4 Review Questions 2. Why are Okazaki fragments formed? Because helicase only unzips DNA in one direction. Because DNA is in a double helix. Because DNA"

Separating the strands of the double helix would provide two templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands, but exactly how new DNA molecules were constructed was still unclear. In one model, semiconservative replication, the two strands of the double helix separate during DNA replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied. After replication in this model, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one daughter or “new” strand. There were two competing models also suggested: conservative and dispersive, which are shown in Figure 9.1. Figure 9.1 Three Models of DNA replication. In the conservative model, parental DNA strands (blue) remained associated in one DNA molecule while new daughter strands (red) remained associated in newly formed DNA molecules. In the semiconservative model, parental strands separated and directed the synthesis of a daughter strand, with each resulting DNA molecule being a hybrid of a parental strand and a daughter strand. In the dispersive model, all resulting DNA strands have regions of double-stranded parental DNA and regions of double-stranded daughter DNA. Figure by Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl devised an experiment in 1958 to test which of these models correctly represents DNA replication (Figure 9.2). They grew the bacterium, Escherichia coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that was incorporated into nitrogenous bases and, eventually, into the DNA. This labeled the parental DNA. The E. coli culture was then shifted into a medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was separated by ultracentrifugation, during which the DNA formed bands according to its density. DNA grown in 15N would be expected to form a band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N or 14N. This suggested either a semiconservative or dispersive mode of replication. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more generation in 14N and spun again. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semiconservative manner. Therefore, the other two models were ruled out. As a result of this experiment, we now know that during DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. The resulting DNA molecules have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells. Figure 9.2 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (blue band) was heavier than DNA grown in 14N (red band), and sedimented to a lower level on ultracentrifugation. After one round of replication, the DNA sedimented halfway between the 15N and 14N levels (purple band), ruling out the conservative model of replication. After a second round of replication, the dispersive model of replication was ruled out. These data supported the semiconservative replication model. Figure by Think about It What would have been the conclusion of Meselson and Stahl’s experiment if, after the first generation, they had found two bands of DNA? 9.2 DNA Replication in Prokaryotes DNA replication has been well studied in bacteria primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs (Mbp) in a single circular chromosome and all of it is replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle bidirectionally (i.e., in both directions) (Figure 9.3). This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is quite rapid and occurs with few errors. E. coli has a single origin of replication, called oriC, on its one chromosome. The origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in adenine-thymine (AT) sequences. Figure 9.3 Prokaryotic DNA Replication. Replication of DNA in prokaryotes begins at a single origin of replication, shown in the figure to the left, and proceeds in a bidirectional manner around the circular chromosome until replication is complete. The bidirectional nature of replication creates two replication forks that are actively mediating the replication process. The right hand figure shows a dynamic model of this process. The red and blue dots represent the incorporation of daughter strand nucleotides during the process of replication. Figures from: and Replication Overview The open regions of DNA that are actively undergoing replication are called replication forks. All the proteins involved in DNA replication aggregate at the replication forks to form a replication complex called a replisome (Table 9.1 and Figure 9.4). DNA replication in the model organism E. coli has been extensively studied, providing a foundation for understanding the diverse mechanisms of genome duplication employed by all organisms. In E. coli, DNA replication is initiated at oriC (Figure 9.3). oriC is ‘melted’ by the action of the DnaA initiator protein to expose two template ssDNA strands that act as platforms for loading the replicative DnaB helicase. One full DnaB hexamer is loaded onto each ssDNA strand with the aid of the helicase loader, DnaC. Additional exposed ssDNA is quickly coated by the ssDNA-binding protein (SSB), which protects DNA and blocks additional DnaB helicase loading. Each DnaB hexamer recruits primase (DnaG), which synthesizes RNA primers used to initiate DNA synthesis, along with the subunits that comprise the replicative DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (PolIII HE). These proteins form the core replisomes that copy the E. coli genome. Once assembled, replisomes replicate bi-directionally away from oriC until, ideally, they undergo programmed disassembly at the termination region, where they encounter ter sites bound by Tus proteins that create ‘replication fork traps’. After completion of DNA replication, the newly synthesized genomes are separated and segregated to daughter cells. Table 9.1 Enzymes involved in DNA Replication in the prokaryote, E. coli Figure 9.4 General Overview of a DNA Replication Fork. At the origin of replication, topoisomerase II relaxes the supercoiled chromosome. Two replication forks are formed by the opening of the double-stranded DNA at the origin, and helicase separates the DNA strands, which are coated by single-stranded binding proteins to keep the strands separated. DNA replication occurs in both directions. An RNA primer complementary to the parental strand is synthesized by RNA primase and is elongated by DNA polymerase III through the addition of nucleotides to the 3′-OH end. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. RNA primers within the lagging strand are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, and the Okazaki fragments are joined by DNA ligase. Figure by Primosome Assembly As noted above, the replication of the bacterial chromosome is initiated at oriC where the initiator protein, DnaA, binds to start the assembly of the enzymatic replisome machine. The early stages of this process involve the assembly of a primosome, that functions to unwind the two strands of DNA at the replication forks and add RNA primers to the DNA templates that will be used by the DNA Polymerase enzymes to begin replication. Subsequent to the remodelling of the replication origin induced by DnaA, the assembly of the bacterial loader-dependent primosome occurs in discrete steps and involves at least four different proteins (initiator protein, helicase, helicase loader protein, and primase) that act in a coordinated and sequential manner (Table 9.1). The oriC region of prokaryotes contains highly conserved sequence motifs that include an AT-rich box domain that serves as the recognition sequence for the binding of the DnaA initiator protein. Initial binding of DnaA to oriC promotes the melting of the DNA double helix and the recruitment of multiple DnaA subunits that form a helical oligomer along the newly opened single stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Figure 9.5). The DnaA protein contains four major domains. Domains III and IV are integral to binding the ssDNA, while domain I is involved with protein-protein interactions. Domain II forms a flexible linker between the protein interaction domain and the DNA binding domains. Figure 9.5 Assembly of a Primosome. DNA melting at oriC and loading of the DnaB6–(DnaC)6 helicase–loader complex onto the DNA bubble. Lower schematic: ATP-bound DnaA (the initiator protein) binds to DnaA-boxes via Domain IV, thereby promoting dsDNA to wrap around the DnaA filament, causing torsional strain to the dsDNA. Meantime, Domain III of DnaA binds to one of the two ssDNA strands of DNA unwiding element and stretches the strand. These interactions cause the AT-rich DNA unwinding element to melt, forming a bubble. At the same time, binding of DnaC (the helicase loader) traps DnaB (the helicase) in an open lockwasher conformation, to enable its loading onto ssDNA. DnaC interacts with DnaA at the end of the filament and serves as an adaptor to load one DnaB–DnaC complex. It is not known if closing of DnaB around ssDNA to form a hexameric ring occurs before or concomitantly with dissociation of DnaC. Domain I of DnaA interacts with the N-terminal domain of DnaB, helping to load another DnaB–DnaC on the complementary strand. Upper insets: The helical filament of DnaA formed by Domains III (light orange) and IV (pale green) of Aquifex aeolicus DnaA (PDB: 3R8F) and Domain IV of E. coli DnaA (pale green) bound to dsDNA (PDB: 1J1V). The ssDNA binds in the middle of the DnaA filament via interactions with the AAA+ Domain III of DnaA. Figure from: In the E.coli system, the helicase loader protein, DnaC, complexed with ATP, binds to hexameric helicase DnaB and forms a DnaB–DnaC complex, which has been conﬁrmed by cryo-electronmicroscope (cryo-EM) studies. The loader protein delivers the helicase on to the melted DNA single strands of the DnaA–oriC nucleoprotein complex at the origin of replication. In vivo, this delivery is associated with the initiator protein, DnaA, whose amino-terminal domain (NTD) is thought to have a role in loading the helicase and helicase loader complex onto the oriC by interacting with helicase, DnaB. After the loader protein dissociates from the helicase ring, the NTD of the helicase interacts with the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the primase and forms a functional primosome. Within the primosome, the helicase (DnaB) acts to unwind the double stranded helix and the primase (DnaG) synthesizes RNA primers on both the leading and lagging DNA strands. Helicases are motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands such as DNA and RNA, using energy from ATP hydrolysis. There are many helicases, representing the great variety of processes in which strand separation must be catalyzed. Approximately 1% of eukaryotic genes code for helicases. The human genome codes for 95 non-redundant helicases: 64 RNA helicases and 31 DNA helicases. Many cellular processes, such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, recombination, DNA repair, and ribosome biogenesis involve the separation of nucleic acid strands that necessitates the use of helicases. In E. coli, the DnaB Helicase (Figure 9.5) is responsible for unwinding the two parent DNA strands to unwind and separating them from one another to form a “Y”-shaped replication fork. The replication forks are the actual site of DNA copying. During replication within the fork, helix destabilizing proteins, called single stranded binding proteins (SSB), bind to the single-stranded regions preventing the strands from rejoining. DNA Polymerases DNA polymerase enzymes are required for the assembly of the daughter strands along each of the template DNA strands. All DNA polymerases require a DNA template and a primer that is used to begin the replication process. The primer is a short strand of RNA that is placed on the DNA template by the primase enzyme. Recall also that DNA contains two antiparallel strands and that DNA polymerases can only add new nucleotides in the 5′ to 3′ direction when synthesizing the daughter strands of DNA. Since both strands of DNA are replicated simultaneously by the same replisome, the leading strand,where the daughter strand of DNA is moving in the 5′ to 3′ direction, is replicated continuously and flows in the same direction as replisome movement. The lagging strand, that lies in the antiparallel dirction, has to be synthesized in the opposite direction of replisome movement and is created using short bursts of DNA polymerase activity leading to the formation of Okazaki Fragments along the template strand. Thus, the lagging strand must continually be primed with short RNA sequences to maintain the formation of the Okazaki Fragments. The RNA primer sequences must then be replaced by DNA and gaps in the backbone of the DNA must also be repaired. E. coli has a total of five DNA polymerases. Three of these enzymes are involved in DNA replication (DNA polymerases I, II, and III). DNA polymerase III is the main polymerase involved in both leading strand biosynthesis and the synthesis of the Okazaki Fragments during DNA replication. The DNA polymerase III holoenzyme is comprised of 10 different proteins organized into three functionally distinct, but physically interconnected assemblies: (1) the αεθ core, (2) the β2 sliding clamp, and (3) the δτnγ3-nδ’ΨX clamp loader complex (Figure 9.6). In the polymerase core, α is the polymerase subunit, ε the 3’–5’ proofreading exonuclease and θ is a small subunit that stabilizes ε. After a RNA primer is made by DnaG, the β2clamp is loaded onto the primer terminus by the clamp loader. The α and ε subunits separately bind the clamp, each via a short linear clamp-binding motif (CBM) to the two symmetrically related CBM-binding pockets of β2. Tethered to the clamp, Pol III is able to synthesize DNA at high speed (∼1000 Nt/s) and with much higher processivity(>150 kb). Figure 9.6 The DNA Replisome. (a) The standard textbook model of a DNA Replisome showing the coupled and highly coordinated processes of leading strand and lagging strand synthesis. DNA polymerase III is connected to the DnaB helicase through the τ subunit of the clamp-loader comples and two or three polymerase cores replicate DNA from both leading strand and lagging strand DNA templates concurrently. The ssDNA in the lagging strand loop is bound by ssDNA binding proteins (SSB). (b) Recent studies have shown that E. coli DNA polymerase III is readily exchangeable at the fork and that leading strand and lagging strand synthesis may not be tightly coupled, or may even be accomplished by different DNA polymerase III holoenzymes. The DnaB helicase can also be decoupled from the DNA polymerase complex and translocate ahead of the apex of the fork. Figure from: Bacterial replisomes are highly flexible and mobile machines, their dynamics being mediated and controlled by a network of protein–protein interactions of different strengths. Many of the replication proteins are either conformationally flexible or contain flexible or unstructured regions, making structural studies by X-ray crystallography or NMR difficult. However, through decades of efforts, structures of all E. coli replication proteins or their bacterial homologs have been solved as complexes, whole proteins or domains. Recent breakthroughs in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have seen structures determined of large replisome subassemblies, even the whole bacteriophage T7 replisome, though so far only at modest resolution. Cryo-EM structures of the E. coli Pol III core–clamp–τC (C-terminal domain of the τ subunit of the clamp-loader) complexes on primer–template DNA in both polymerization and proofreading modes were recently solved at 8 and 6.7 Å, respectively, along with structures of a DNA-free complex (Figure 9.7). These structures resemble previously proposed structural models, with some surprises. For example, in the DNA-bound polymerization complex, the β2 clamp becomes almost perpendicular to the DNA strands (Figure 9.7a,b), in contrast to its tilted configuration in the crystal structure of DNA-bound β2. While the Pol III α polymerase subunit binds to DNA in a conformation similar to the crystal structure of DNA-bound Thermus aquaticus (Taq) α, the locations of C-terminal domains (αCTD, comprising the oligonucleotide binding domain, OB, and the τ-binding, TBD, domains) are different. In the Taq α structure and the DNA-free complex, the αCTD is close to the polymerase active site with the OB domain positioned to bind and deliver the ssDNA template into the active site (Figure 9.7c,d). In the DNA-bound cryo-EM structures, these domains are shifted toward the little finger domain of α, the domain that directly contacts the β2 clamp; they are therefore far away from the template strand entering the active site (Figure 9.7e). The OB domain contacts both the little finger and thumb domains of α as well as the β2 clamp and ε. The face of the OB domain that had been thought to be involved in ssDNA template binding now directly faces and is relatively close to the dsDNA. Additionally, ε wedges between the α thumb domain and the clamp. This previously unappreciated interaction network apparently stabilizes the whole complex. Figure 9.7 Structures of the E. coli polymerase–clamp-τC–DNA complexes. (a) Surface representations of the polymerization (left) and proofreading (right) complexes. The N-terminal domains of α (αNTD, residues 1–963, are colored in deep salmon), and the OB (964–1072) and τ-binding domains (TBD, 1173–1160) of αCTD in brown and dark salmon, respectively, ε in yellow, β2 in aquamarine, θ in orange and τC in slate. The polymerization complex does not include θ, and τC and the αCTD are missing from the proofreading complex. (b) Cartoon representations of complexes showing the differences in the primer–template DNA. In the polymerization complex (left), the DNA has B-form structure, while in the proofreading complex, the primer DNA is frayed with the end of the newly synthesized strand in the active center of ε. The proofreading complex is rotated slightly to show DNA in the active center of ε and the θ subunit is omitted for clarity. (c) Surface representation of αNTD from the DNA-bound polymerization complex (PDB: 5FKV), showing the thumb, palm, fingers, and PHP domains. (d) Positioning of the αCTD in the DNA-free complexes (PDB: 5FKU). (e) Positioning of the αCTD in the DNA-bound polymerization complex (PDB: 5FKV). While the OB domain in the DNA-free complex is close to the active site of Pol III α, it is far away in the DNA-bound complex. The OB domain is colored in marine and the TBD in magenta. The αNTD (gray) in the two complexes shows relatively minor changes compared to αCTD. Figure from: Overall, there is significant conformational changes in the DNA Polymerase III complex upon binding to the DNA that cause the tail of the polymerase to move from interacting with the clamp in the DNA-bound state, to a position 35 Å away from the clamp in the DNA-free state (Video 9.1). It has been hypothesized that this large conformational change may help the polymerase act as a switch to facilitate the lagging strand synthesis. On the lagging strand, the polymerase repositions to a newly primed site every ∼1000 bp. To do so, the polymerase needs to release both clamp and DNA. The switch-like movement of the polymerase tail may play a part in the release and consequent repositioning of the polymerase at the end of the Okazaki fragment. Video 9.1 DNA Binding Induces Large Conformational Changes in the DNA Polymerase III Complex. The video shows the linear morphing of the DNA-free to the DNA-bound state showing the large conformation change between the two states. The green subunit is the β-clamp, The α-subunit is shown in orange with the active-site residues in magenta, the α-C-terminal domain (α-CTD shown in brown, the ε-subunit in yellow, and the τ-tail shown in blue. Video from: The proofreading complex is fairly similar to the polymerization complex, with small movements of individual protein components (Figure 9.7a,b). The most significant movements include a rotation and a tilt of duplex DNA against the plane of β2, locking the DNA against the inner surface of the β2 ring (Figure 9.7b). The polymerase thumb domain and ε also move towards the DNA. The thumb domain wedges between two DNA strands with unmatched base pairs, resulting in a highly distorted and frayed DNA substrate. The newly synthesized strand is therefore able to reach the nuclease active site of ε for editing. Considering that the proofreading complex is fairly similar to the polymerization complexes and duplex DNA with two unmatched base-pairs tends to fray, it is proposed that ε works passively by waiting for DNA to reach its nuclease active center when a wrong nucleotide is incorporated rather than responding actively to the misincorporation event. In a complementary single-molecule biophysical study, the clamp-bound Pol III core has been shown to be remarkably stable and processive in the proofreading mode in the absence of incoming dNTPs. Bacterial replisomes have long been believed to be highly coordinated, highly processive machines capable of copying the whole chromosome without dissociation. Two or three polymerase cores of the same E. coli Pol III HE were believed to synthesize both DNA strands, with the lagging strand polymerase repeatedly being recycled for new Okazaki Fragment synthesis, as described above. Lagging-strand polymerase recycling has been debated to be triggered by various collision or signaling mechanisms in a well-controlled manner that likely involves the movement of the τ-tail region. However, recent studies find that bacterial polymerases also readily exchange at replication forks and that leading-strand and lagging-strand DNA synthesis may not always be tightly coupled. Figure 9.6b depicts a proposed model for this exchange. Overall, DNA polymerase III is a highly processive enzyme incorporating 600 to 1,000 bases per second with greater that 100,000 bases incorporated per binding event, and an error rate of approximately 1 per million. DNA polymerase I, aids in the process of lagging strand synthesis, in that, this polymerase removes the RNA primers and incorporates DNA in its place. DNA polymerase II, although not well understood, is thought to play an editing role following lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerase I. DNA polymerases I and II also play a role in DNA repair, as do DNA polymerases IV and V. DNA polymerase Iis similar to DNA polymerase III in that it it has 5′ to 3′ polymerase activity and also has 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity to mediate both the processivity and the DNA proofreading function of the enzyme. In addition, DNA polymerase I also contains a large protein domain called the Klenow fragment that exhibits 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity (Figure 9.8). The 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity is responsible for removal of the RNA primers along the lagging strand. The processivity of this enzyme enables the polymerase to refill these gaps with DNA. However, DNA polymerase I is unable to connect the backbone of the newly synthesized Okazaki Fragments with the downstream fragment. The repair of gaps in the DNA backbone is mediated by a DNA ligase enzyme. Figure 9.8 Structure of E. coli DNA Polymerase I. DNA polymerase I exhibits 5′ to 3′ polymerase activity and 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity mediating the processivity and proof reading activities of the enzyme. DNA polymerase I also contains a 5′ to 3′ exonuclease activity housed in a special domain of the enzyme called the Klenow fragment. This domain is responsible for removing the RNA primer sequences from newly synthesized DNA. The 5′ to 3′ polymerase activity is then used to replace the RNA primer with DNA. The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity ensures that the correct bases are incorporated. Figure from: DNA Ligase enzymes seal the breaks in the backbone of DNA that are caused during DNA replication, DNA damage, or during the DNA repair process. The biochemical activity of DNA ligases results in the sealing of breaks between 5′-phosphate and 3′-hydroxyl termini within a strand of DNA. DNA ligases have been differentiated as being ATP-dependent or NAD+-dependent depending on the co-factor (or co-substrate) that is used during their reaction. Typically, more than one type of DNA ligase is found within an organism. As shown in Figure 9.9, the DNA ligase enzyme is covalently modified by the addition of the AMP-moiety to a Lysine residue on the enzyme. The AMP is derived from the ATP or NADH cofactor. The downstream 5′-phosphate at the site of the DNA nick is able to mediate a nucleophilic attack on the AMP-enzyme complex, causing the AMP to transfer to the 5′-phospahte position of the DNA. The AMP serves as a good leaving group for the nucleophilic attack of the upstream 3′-OH with the 5′-phosphate to seal the DNA backbone, and release the AMP. Figure 9.9 DNA Ligase Reaction. DNA ligases catalyse the crucial step of joining breaks in duplex DNA during , and , and require either Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as a cofactor. Shown on the upper left is DNA ligase I repairing chromosomal damage. The three visable protein structures are: The DNA binding domain (DBD) which is bound to the DNA minor groove both upstream and downstream of the damaged area. The OB-fold domain (OBD) unwinds the DNA slightly over a span of six base pairs and is generally involved in nucleic acid binding. The Adenylation domain (AdD) contains enzymatically active residues that join the broken nucleotides together by catalyzing the formation of a phosphodiester bond between a phosphate and hydroxyl group. It is likely that all mammalian DNA ligases (Ligases I, III, and IV) have a similar ring-shaped architecture and are able to recognize DNA in a similar manner. The upper right diagram is a high-resolution structure of E. coli LigA in complex with nicked adenylated DNA from PDB 2OWO, visualized by UCSF Chimera. The various domains are indicated by different colours and relate to Pfam domains indicated. The lower diagram depicts the catalytic mechanism of DNA Ligase I. The ATP cofactor forms a covalent linkage with a lysine residue at the α-phosphate position casing the release of diphosphate. The AMP is used to activate the 5′ phosphate group enabling the upstream 3′-OH group to mediate attack on the central phosphorus atom. AMP serves as the leaving group. Figure on the upper left by: Figure on the right by: and the lower figure by: A summary of the process of DNA replication is shown in Video 9.2 Video 9.2 Overview of the DNA Replication Process Video from: Topoisomerase Enzymes Unwinding of the double-stranded helix at the replication fork generates winding tension in the DNA in the form of positive supercoils upstream of the replication fork. Enzymes called topoisomerases counteract this by introducing negative supercoils into the DNA in order to relieve this stress in the helical molecule during replication. There are four known topoisomerase enzymes found in E. coli that fall into two major classes, Type I Topoisomerases and Type II Topoisomerases (Figure 9.10). Topoisomerase I and III are Type I topoisomerases, whereas DNA gyrase and Topoisomerase IV are Type II topoisomerases. Figure 9.10 Structures of Type I and Type II Topoisomerase. (A) Crystal structure of a Type I Topoisomerase, shown in blue, bound to DNA, shown in orange and yellow. (B) Crystal structure of a Type II Topoisomerase. Topoisomerase II forms a tetrameric structure, shown in green and blue. ATP cofactors (pink) are shown bound to the enzyme. Type I Topoisomerases relieve tension caused during the winding and unwinding of DNA. One way that they can do this is by making a cut or nick in one strand of the DNA double helix (Figure 9.11). The 5′-phosphoryl side of the nicked DNA strand remains covalently bound to the enzyme at a tyrosine residue, while the 3′-end is held noncovalently by the enzyme. The Type I topoisomerases rotate or spin the 3′-end of the DNA around the intact DNA strand. This releases overwinding in the DNA and effectively releases tension. The enzyme completes the reaction by resealing the phosphodiester backbone or ligating the broken strand back together. Overall, only one strand of the DNA is broken during the reaction mechanism and there is NO requirement of ATP during the reaction. The E. coli Topo I enzyme can only remove negative DNA supercoils, but not positive ones. Thus, this enzyme is not involved in relieving the positive supercoiling caused by the DNA helicase during replication. This is in contrast to eukaryotic Topo I that can relieve both positive and negative supercoiling. Although E. coli Topoisomerase I is not directly involved in relieving the tension caused by DNA replication, it is essential for E. coli viability. It is thought to help balance the actions of the Type II topoisomerases and help maintain optimal supercoiling density within the chromosomal DNA. Thus, Topo I is thought to help maintain homeostatic balance of chromosome supercoiling within E. coli. Topo III, which is also a Type I Topoisomerase, appears to play a role in the decatenation of the daughter chromosomes during DNA replication, but does not play a role in the relaxation of supercoiling. Figure 9.11 Reaction of Type I Topoisomerases. During the reaction, Type I Topoisomerases nick one strand of the DNA. One end of the nicked DNA is covalently attached to the enzyme, shown in light green in the lower diagrams. The other end is held non-covalently and rotated around the double helix to unwind the supercoiling and relax the DNA. Once supercoiling tension is released, the backbone is resealed and the Topoisomerase I enzyme is released. Figure remixed from: , and Type II Topoisomerases have multiple functions within the cell. They can increase or decrease winding tension within the DNA or they can unknot or decatanate DNA that has become tangled with another strand (Figure 9.12). It does so by a more dangerous method than their Type I counterparts, by breaking both strands of the DNA during their reaction mechanism. The enzyme is covalently attached to both broken sides while the other DNA helix is passed through the break. The double strand break is then resealed. Figure 9.12 Reaction of Type II Topoisomerases. The proposed type II topoisomerase reaction cycle is exemplified by topoisomerase IV. Topoisomerase IV subunits are denoted in grey, cyan, and yellow. The gate or G-DNA is in green and the transported or T-DNA is in mauve. ATP bound to the ATPase domains is denoted by a red dot. In step 1, the G-DNA binds with the enzyme. ATP and the T-DNA segment associate with the enzyme in step 2. In step 3, the G-DNA is cleaved and the T-DNA is passed through the break. Drug-targetable domains within the type II topoisomerase complex are highlighted in subsections A, B and C with examples on the right-hand side of the figure. Figure modified from: DNA gyrase, is the type II topoisomerase enzyme that is primarily involved in relieving positive supercoiling tension that results due to the helicase unwinding at the replication fork. Type II Topoisomerases, especially Topo IV, also address a key mechanistic challenge that faces the bacterial replisome during termination of DNA replication. The circular nature of the bacterial chromosome dictates that a pair of replisomes that initiate from a single origin of replication will eventually converge on each other in a head-to-head orientation.Positive supercoiling accumulates between the two replisomes as they converge, but the activity of DNA gyrase, which normally removes positive supercoils, becomes limited by the decreasing amount of template DNA available.Instead, supercoils may diffuse behind the replisomes, forming precatenanes between newlyr eplicated DNA; in E.coli these must be resolved byTopo IV for chromosome segregation to occur. Tus Proteins and the Termination of Replication Proper termination of DNA replication is important for genome stability. E. coli replication terminates in the region opposite oriC. There are ten 23-bp termination (Ter) sites in the region with some sequence variations that determine their binding affinities for the monomeric termination protein Tus (Figure 9.13). Tus binds to Ter with high affinity in 1:1 ratio, and Tus–Ter can further form a very stable ‘lock’ complex if cytosine-6 of the strictly conserved G–C(6) base pair of Ter is flipped out of the DNA duplex and bound in a preformed cytosine-binding pocket of Tus (Figure 9.13b). The Tus–Ter lock complex is polar with a permissive face that allows the replisome to pass unhindered and a non-permissive face that can block the replisome. The ten Ter sites are organized as two oppositely orientated groups of five, allowing the replisome to pass the first group and be blocked at the second. This ensures that the two replication forks converge in the terminus region for proper chromosome segregation. Figure 9.13 Mechanisms of replisome blockage by Tus–Ter replication termination complexes.(a) Schematic representation of the E. coli chromosome, showing positions of oriC and Ter sites. The clockwise moving fork passes through the permissive sites shown in green and is arrested at the non-permissive sites shown in red. (b) Schematic representation of structure of the ‘locked’ Tus-Ter complex (PDB: 2I06), showing cytosine-6 in its binding pocket in Tus. (c) Interactions of residue Arg198 of Tus with both strands of Ter in complexes with double-stranded wild-type Ter (PDB: 2I05, left) and the Tus–Ter UGLC complex (GC(6) base pair inverted; PDB: 4XR3, right). Figure from: 9.3 DNA Replication of Extrachromosomal Elements: Plasmids and Viruses To copy their nucleic acids, plasmids and viruses frequently use variations on the pattern of DNA replication described for prokaryote genomes. We will focus here on one style known as the rolling circle method. Rolling Circle Replication Whereas many bacterial plasmids replicate by a process similar to that used to copy the bacterial chromosome, other plasmids, several bacteriophages, and some viruses of eukaryotes use rolling circle replication (Figure 9.14). The circular nature of plasmids and the circularization of some viral genomes on infection make this possible. Rolling circle replication begins with the enzymatic nicking of one strand of the double-stranded circular molecule at the double-stranded origin (dso) site. In bacteria, DNA polymerase III binds to the 3′-OH group of the nicked strand and begins to unidirectionally replicate the DNA using the un-nicked strand as a template, displacing the nicked strand as it does so. Completion of DNA replication at the site of the original nick results in full displacement of the nicked strand, which may then recircularize into a single-stranded DNA molecule. RNA primase then synthesizes a primer to initiate DNA replication at the single-stranded origin (sso) site of the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecule, resulting in a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule identical to the other circular DNA molecule. Figure 9.14 Rolling Circle Replication. The process of rolling circle replication is initiated by a single stranded nick in the DNA. Within prokaryotes, DNA polymerase III is utilized to generate the daughter strand. DNA ligase rejoins nicks in the backbone and enables the initiation of DNA synthesis of the second daughter strand. Figure by 9.4 DNA Replication in Eukaryotes The Cell Cycle The cell cycle is an ordered series of events involving cell growth and cell division that produces two new daughter cells. Cells on the path to cell division proceed through a series of precisely timed and carefully regulated stages of growth, DNA replication, and division that produce two genetically identical cells. The cell cycle has two major phases: interphase and the mitotic phase (Figure 9.15). During interphase, the cell grows and DNA is replicated. During the mitotic phase, the replicated DNA and cytoplasmic contents are separated and the cell divides. Watch this video about the cell cycle: Figure 9.15 Diagram of the Cell Cycle. A cell moves through a series of phases in an orderly manner. During interphase, G1 involves cell growth and protein synthesis, the S phase involves DNA replication and the replication of the centrosome, and G2 involves further growth and protein synthesis. The mitotic phase follows interphase. Mitosis is nuclear division during which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Usually the cell will divide after mitosis in a process called cytokinesis in which the cytoplasm is divided and two daughter cells are formed. Figure from During interphase, the cell undergoes normal processes while also preparing for cell division. For a cell to move from interphase to the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G1, S, and G2. The first stage of interphase is called the G1 phase, or first gap, because little change is visible. However, during the G1 stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins, as well as accumulating enough energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus. Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the S phase (synthesis phase), DNA replication results in the formation of two identical copies of each chromosome—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached at the centromere region (Figure 9.16B). At this stage, each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. In mammals, the centrosome consists of a pair of rod-like centrioles at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of many eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi. Figure 9.16 Human Chromosome Structure. (A) Shows a spectral karyogram of a normal human female. Humans have a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes for a total of 46. Each pair of chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosomes as they contain copies of the same gene regions. Each of the homologous pairs of chromosomes are stained the same color. Chromosomes are shown in their condensed, unreplicated state. (B) Shows a schematic diagram of a single chromosome before (lower diagram) and after (upper diagram) replication. Upon replication, the identical copies of the chromosome are called sister chromatids and are linked together at the centromere structure. Figure A from:, and Figure B from: In the G2 phase, or second gap, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes the proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic spindle. There may be additional cell growth during G2. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis. To make two daughter cells, the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm must be divided. The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and moved to opposite poles of the cell, and then the cell is divided into two new identical daughter cells. The first portion of the mitotic phase, mitosis, is composed of five stages, which accomplish nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells. If cells are not traversing through one of the phases of interphase or mitosis, they are said to be in G0 or a resting state. If cells enter G0 permanently, they are said to have entered a stage of replicative senescence and will no longer be maintained for long term viability within the organism. Progression of cells through the cell cycle requires the coordinated actions of specific protein kinases, known as cyclin-dependent kinases. Cyclin-dependent kinases are usually abbreviated as CDK or CDC proteins. CDK/CDC proteins require the binding of a regulatory cyclin protein to become activated (Figure 9.17). The major cyclin proteins that drive the cell cycle in the forward direction, are expressed only at discrete times during the cell cycle. When activated by a cyclin counterpart, CDK/CDC enzymes phosphorylate downstream targets involved with cell cycle progression. For example, the primary cyclin-CDK complex involved in the initiation of DNA replication during S-phase is the CyclinE-CDK2 complex. CDK2 is activated by the expression and binding of Cyclin E during late G1 phase. This causes CDK2 to phosphorylate downstream targets, including the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, pRb. pRB normally binds and inhibits the the activity of transcription factors from the E2F family. Following the release of E2F transcription factors from pRb, E2Fs activate the transcription of genes involved in DNA replication and the leads to the progression of cells into S-phase. Figure 9.17 Cyclin Dependent Kinases (CDKs) and their Cyclin Regulatory Subunits. (A) CDK-cyclin complexes with direct functions in regulating the cell cycle are shown. CDK3/cyclin C drives cell cycle entry from G0. CDK4/6/cyclin D complexes initiate phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) and promote the activation of CDK2/cyclin E complex. In late G1, CDK2/cyclin E complex completes phosphorylation and inactivation of pRb, which releases the E2F transcription factors and G1/S transition takes place. DNA replication takes place in S phase. CDK2/cyclin A complex regulates progression through S phase and CDK1/cyclin A complex through G2 phase in preparation for mitosis (M). Mitosis is initiated by CDK1/cyclin B complex. (B) Shows the cyclical nature of cyclin expression during cell cycle progression. Cyclin abundance is regulated by transcriptional expression and rapid protein degradation. Thus, their biological activity is targeted at very specific time points during cell cyle progression. Figure A from: and Figure B from: Replication Initiation Origin organization, specification, and activation in eukaryotes are more complex than in bacterial or archaeal kingdoms and significantly deviate from the paradigm established for prokaryotic replication initiation. The large genome sizes of eukaryotic cells, which range from 12 Mbp in S. cerevisiae to 3 Gbp in humans, necessitates that DNA replication starts at several hundred (in budding yeast) to tens of thousands (in humans) origins to complete DNA replication of all chromosomes during each cell cycle (Figure 9.18). Figure 9.18. Eukaryotic chromosomes are typically linear, and each contains multiple origins of replication. Lefthand figure is a graphic representation of eukayotic origins of replication, while the righthand image is a Cryo-electron micrograph image The figure on the lefthand side is from: and the figure on the righthand side is from: With the exception of S.cerevisiae and related Saccharomycotina species, eukaryotic origins do not contain consensus DNA sequence elements but their location is influenced by contextual cues such as local DNA topology, DNA structural features, and chromatin environment. Nonetheless, eukaryotic origin function still relies on a conserved initiator protein complex to load replicative helicases onto DNA during the late M and G1 phases of the cell cycle, a step known as origin licensing. In contrast to their bacterial counterparts, replicative helicases in eukaryotes are loaded onto origin duplex DNA in an inactive, double-hexameric form and only a subset of them (10–20% in mammalian cells) is activated during any given S phase, events that are referred to as origin firing. The location of active eukaryotic origins is therefore determined on at least two different levels, origin licensing to mark all potential origins, and origin firing to select a subset that permits assembly of the replication machinery and initiation of DNA synthesis. The extra licensed origins serve as backup and are activated only upon slowing or stalling of nearby replication forks, ensuring that DNA replication can be completed when cells encounter replication stress. Together, the excess of licensed origins and the tight cell cycle control of origin licensing and firing embody two important strategies to prevent under- and overreplication and to maintain the integrity of eukaryotic genomes. Eukaryotic DNA Polymerase Enzymes Similar to DNA replication in prokaryotes, DNA replication in eukaryotes occurs in opposite directions between the two new strands at the replication fork. Within eukaryotes, two replicative polymerases synthesize DNA in opposing orientations (Figure 9.16). Polymerase ε (epsilon)synthesizes DNA in a continuous fashion, as it is “pointed” in the same direction as DNA unwinding. Similar to bacterial replication, this strand is known as the leading strand. In contrast, polymerase δ (delta) synthesizes DNA on the opposite template strand in a fragmented, or discontinuous, manner and this strand is termed the lagging strand. The discontinuous stretches of DNA replication products on the lagging strand are known as Okazaki fragments and are about 100 to 200 bases in length at eukaryotic replication forks. Owing to the “lagging” nature, the lagging strand generally contains a longer stretch of ssDNA that is coated by single-stranded binding proteins, which stabilizes ssDNA templates by preventing secondary structure formation or other transactions at the exposed ssDNA. In eukaryotes, ssDNA stabilization is maintained by the heterotrimeric complex known as replication protein A (RPA) (Figure 9.19). Each Okazaki fragment is preceded by an RNA primer, which is displaced by the procession of the next Okazaki fragment during synthesis. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases (such as Fen1, discussed later). At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the flap is sealed by DNA ligase I. Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic Okazaki fragment, DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading-strand synthesis. Figure 9.19 The Eukaryotic Replisome Complex Coordinates DNA Replication. Replication on the leading and lagging strands is performed by Pol ε and Pol δ, respectively. Many replisome factors (including the FPC [fork protection complex], Claspin, And1, and RFC [the replication factor C clamp loader]) are charged with regulating polymerase functions and coordinating DNA synthesis with unwinding of the template strand by Cdc45-MCM [mini-chromosome maintenance]-GINS [go-ichi-ni-san]. The replisome also associates with checkpoint proteins as DNA replication and genome integrity surveillance mechanisms. Figure from: At the eukaryotic replication fork, three distinct replicative polymerase complexes contribute to canonical DNA replication: α, δ, and ε. These three polymerases are essential for viability of the cell. Because DNA polymerases require a primer on which to begin DNA synthesis, first, polymerase α (Pol α) acts as a replicative primase. Pol α is associated with an RNA primase and this complex accomplishes the priming task by synthesizing a primer that contains a short ~10-nucleotide RNA stretch followed by 10 to 20 DNA bases. Importantly, this priming action occurs at replication initiation at origins to begin leading-strand synthesis and also at the 5′ end of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. However, Pol α is not able to continue DNA replication. From in vitro studies, it was observed that DNA replication must be “handed off” to another polymerase to continue synthesis. The polymerase switching requires clamp loaders. Initially, it was thought that Pol δ performed leading-strand replication and that Pol α completed each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. Using mutator polymerase variants and mapping nucleotide misincorporation events, Kunkel and colleagues found that Pol ε and Pol δ mutations lead to mismatched nucleotide incorporation only on the leading and lagging strands, respectively. Thus, normal DNA replication requires the coordinated actions of three DNA polymerases: Pol α for priming synthesis, Pol ε for leading-strand replication, and Pol δ for generating Okazaki fragments during lagging-strand synthesis (Figure 9.16). In eukaryotes, DNA polymerases are grouped into seven families (A, B, C, D, X, Y, and RT). Crystal structures of the three nuclear replicative DNA polymerases demonstrate that they belong to the B family (Figure 9.17). All three replicative DNA polymerases are multi-subunit enzymes (Table 9.2) Table 9.2 Subunits of the Major Eukaryotic Replicative DNA Polymerases Table from: All B family polymerases are composed of five subdomains: the fingers, thumb, and palm which constitute the core of the enzyme, as well as an exonuclease domain and an N-terminal domain (NTD). The palm, a highly conserved fold composed of four antiparallel β strands and two helices, harbors two strictly conserved catalytic aspartates located in motif A, DXXLYPS and motif C, DTDS (Figure 9.20). This fold is shared by a very large group of enzymes, including DNA and RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, CRISPR polymerase, and even reverse (3′–5′) transferases. In contrast, the thumb and fingers subdomains exhibit substantially more structural diversity. The fingers undergo a conformational change upon binding DNA and the correct incoming nucleotide. This movement allows residues in the fingers subdomain to come in contact with the nucleotide in the nascent base pair. The thumb holds the DNA duplex during replication and plays a part in processivity. The exonuclease domain carries a 3′–5′ proofreading activity, which removes misincorporated nucleotides. The NTD seems to be devoid of catalytic activity. In pol δ the NTD comprises three motifs: one has a topology resembling an OB fold, a single-stranded DNA binding motif, and another bears an RNA-binding motif (RNA Recognition Motif or RRM). The NTD likely plays a role in polymerase stability and fidelity through its interactions with other domains. Figure 9.20 Ternary complexes of polymerases α, δ, ε, and RB69 gp43 are illustrated from identical orientations for comparison. The thumb (green) and fingers (dark blue) domains grasp the duplex nucleic acid (primer shown in beige, template in orange) against the palm domain (red). The N-terminal domain appears in gold, adjacent to the 3′–5′ exonuclease domain (cyan). (A) Polymerase α (PDBID 4FYD) binds an RNA/DNA hybrid, where the wide, shallow minor groove of A-form DNA is apparent near the thumb. The 3′–5′ exonuclease domain is devoid of activity. A helical region (magenta) in the inactivated exonuclease domain stabilizes the 5′end of the template. (B) Polymerase δ (PDBID 3IAY) harbors a large β hairpin motif (magenta), which is important in switching the primer strand from the polymerase active site to the exonuclease active site in the event of proofreading. (C) Polymerase ε (PDBID 4M8O) wields a unique P-domain (purple), which endows the polymerase with increased processivity. Interestingly, the β hairpin motif is atrophied in pol ε. (D) Conservation of the family B DNA polymerase fold, and domain organization, is evident when the model enzyme from bacteriophage RB69 gp43 (PDBID 2OZS) is viewed along with the three eukaryotic replicative polymerases. The domain delineation for each polymerase is given in Table S1. Figure was made with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.4 Schrödinger, LLC.) Figure from: DNA polymerases require additional factors to support DNA replication in vivo. DNA polymerases have a semi-closed hand structure, which allows them to load onto DNA and translocate. This structure permits DNA polymerase to hold the single-stranded template, incorporate dNTPs at the active site, and release the newly formed double strand. However, the conformation of DNA polymerases does not allow for their stable interaction with the template DNA. To strengthen the interaction between template and polymerase, DNA sliding clamps have evolved, promoting the processivity of replicative polymerases. In eukaryotes, this sliding clamp is a homotrimer known as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), which forms a ring structure. The PCNA ring has polarity with a surface that interacts with DNA polymerases and tethers them securely to DNA. PCNA-dependent stabilization of DNA polymerases has a significant effect on DNA replication because it enhances polymerase processivity up to 1,000-fold (Figure 9.19). The DNA helicases (MCM proteins) and polymerases must also remain in close contact at the replication fork (Figure 9.19). If unwinding occurs too far in advance of synthesis, large tracts of ssDNA are exposed. This can activate DNA damage signaling or induce aberrant DNA repair processes. To thwart these problems, the eukaryotic replisome contains specialized proteins that are designed to regulate the helicase activity ahead of the replication fork. These proteins also provide docking sites for physical interaction between helicases and polymerases, thereby ensuring that duplex unwinding is coupled with DNA synthesis. Control of Origin Firing Origin usage in eukaryotes can be dynamic, with origin firing at different sites depending on cell type and developmental stage. Nevertheless, the mechanism of replisome assembly and origin firing is highly conserved. During late mitosis and G1phase, cell cycle proteins, such as Cdc6, associate with Ori sites throughout the genome and recruit the helicase enzymes, MCMs 2-7 (Figure 9.21A). At this time, double hexamers of the MCM2-7 complex are loaded at replication origins. This generates a pre-replication complex (pre-RC). Origins with an associated pre-RC are considered licensed for replication. Licensed replication origins can then be “fired,” when replication actually initiates at the Ori. Origin firing is brought about by multiple phosphorylation events carried out by the cyclin E-CDK2 complex at the onset of S phase and by other cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) prior to individual origin firing (Figure 9.21B). Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are the families of protein kinases first discovered for their role in regulating the cell cycle. They are also involved in regulating transcription, mRNA processing, and the differentiation of nerve cells. CDKs are activited through the binding of an associated cyclin regulatory protein. Without a cyclin, CDKs exhibit little kinase activity. Following the phosphorylation of the pre-RC, origin melting occurs and DNA unwinding by the helicase generates ssDNA, exposing a template for replication (Figure 9.21C). The replisome then begins to form with the localization of replisome factors such as Cdc45. DNA synthesis begins on the melted template, and the replication machinery translocates away from the origin in a bidirectional manner. Figure 9.21 MCM2-7 loads onto DNA at replication origins during G1 and unwinds DNA ahead of replicative polymerases. (A) The combined activities of Cdc6 and Cdt1 bring MCM complexes (shown as blue circles of varying shades) to replication origins. (B) CDK/DDK-dependent phosphorylation of pre-RC components leads to replisome assembly and origin firing. Cdc6 and Cdt1 are no longer required and are removed from the nucleus or degraded (C) MCMs and associated proteins (GINS and Cdc45 are shown) unwind DNA to expose template DNA. At this point replisome assembly can be completed and replication initiated. “P” indicates phosphorylation. Figure from: Replication through Nucleosomes Eukaryotic genomes are substantially more complicated than the smaller and unadorned prokaryotic genomes. Eukaryotic cells have multiple noncontiguous DNA components, chromosomes, each of which must be compacted to allow packaging within the confined space of a nucleus. As seen in chapter 4, chromosomes are packaged by wrapping ~147 nucleotides (at intervals averaging 200 nucleotides) around an octamer of histone proteins, forming the nucleosome. The histone octamer includes two copies each of histone H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. In chapter 8, it was highlighted that histone proteins are subject to a variety of post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, and ubiquitination that represent vital epigenetic marks. The tight association of histone proteins with DNA in nucleosomes suggests that eukaryotic cells possess proteins that are designed to remodel histones ahead of the replication fork, in order to allow smooth progression of the replisome. It is also essential to reassemble histones behind the fork to reestablish the nucleosome conformation. Furthermore, it is important to transmit the epigenetic information found on the parental nucleosomes to the daughter nucleosomes, in order to preserve the same chromatin state. In other words, the same histone modifications should be present on the daughter nucleosomes as were on the parental nucleosomes. This must all be done while doubling the amount of chromatin, which requires incorporation of newly synthesized histone proteins. This process is accomplished by histone chaperones and histone remodelers, which are discussed below (Figure 9.22). Figure 9.22 Nucleosome displacement and deposition during DNA replication. Histones are removed from chromatin ahead of the replication fork. FACT may facilitate this process. Asf1 recruits histone H3-H4 dimers to the replication fork. CAF-1 and Rtt106 load newly synthesized (light purple) histones to establish chromatin behind the fork. Previously loaded histones (dark purple) are also deposited on both daughter DNA strands. The histone chaperones involved in these processes are associated with replisome proteins: CAF-1/Rtt106 with PCNA and FACT/Asf1 with MCMs. Figure from: Several histone chaperones are known to be involved in replication-coupled nucleosome assembly, including the FACT complex. The FACT complex components were originally identified as proteins that greatly stimulate transcription by RNA polymerase II. In budding yeast, FACT was found to interact with DNA Pol α-primase complex, and the FACT subunits were found to interact genetically with replication factors. More recently, studies showed that FACT facilitates DNA replication in vivo and is associated with the replisome in budding yeast and human cells. The FACT complex is a heterodimer that does not hydrolyze ATP, but facilitates the “loosening” of histones in nucleosomes Replication Fork Barriers and the Termination of Replication In prokaryotes, such as the E. coli, bidirectional replication initiates at a single replication origin on the circular chromosome and terminates at a site approximately opposed from the origin. This replication terminator region contains DNA sequences known as Ter sites, polar replication terminators that are bound by the Tus protein. The Ter-Tus complex counteracts helicase activity, resulting in replication termination. In this way, prokaryotic replication forks pause and terminate in a predictable manner during each round of DNA replication. In eukaryotes, the situation differs. Replication termination typically occurs by the collision of two replication forks anywhere between two active replication origins. The location of the collision can vary based on the replication rate of each of the forks and the timing of origin firing. Often, if a replication fork is stalled or collapsed at a specific site, replication of the site can be rescued when a replisome traveling in the opposite direction completes copying the region. However, there are numerous programmed replication fork barriers (RFBs) and replication “challenges” throughout the genome. To efficiently terminate or pause replication forks, some fork barriers are bound by RFB proteins in a manner analogous to E. coli Tus. In these circumstances, the replisome and the RFB proteins must specifically interact to stop replication fork progression. 9.5 Replication of Mitochondrial DNA Mammalian mitochondria contain multiple copies of a circular, double-stranded DNA genome approximately 16.6 kb in length (Figure 9.23). The two strands of mtDNA differ in their base composition, with one being rich in guanines, making it possible to separate a heavy (H) and a light (L) strand by density centrifugation.The mtDNA contains one longer noncoding region (NCR) also referred to as the control region. In the NCR, there are promoters for polycistronic transcription, one for each mtDNA strand; the light strand promoter (LSP) and the heavy strand promoter (HSP). The NCR also harbors the origin for H-strand DNA replication (OH). A second origin for L-strand DNA replication (OL) is located outside the NCR, within a tRNA cluster. Figure 9.23 Map of human mtDNA. The genome encodes for 13 mRNA (green), 22 tRNA (violet), and 2 rRNA (pale blue) molecules. There is also a major noncoding region (NCR), which is shown enlarged at the top in blue. The major NCR contains the heavy strand promoter (HSP), the light strand promoter (LSP), three conserved sequence boxes (CSB1-3, orange), the H-strand origin of replication (OH), and the termination-associated sequence (TAS, yellow). The triple-stranded displacement-loop (D-loop) structure is formed by premature termination of nascent H-strand DNA synthesis at TAS. The short H-strand replication product formed in this manner is termed 7S DNA. A minor NCR, located approximately 11,000 bp downstream of OH, contains the L-strand origin of replication (OL). Figure from: A dedicated DNA replication machinery is required for its maintenance. Mammalian mtDNA is replicated by proteins distinct from those used for nuclear DNA replication and many are related to replication factors identified in bacteriophages. DNA polymerase γ (POLγ) is the replicative polymerase in mitochondria. In human cells, POLγ is a heterotrimer with one catalytic subunit (POLγA) and two accessory subunits (POLγB). POLγA belongs to the A family of DNA polymerases and contains a 3′–5′ exonuclease domain that acts to proofread the newly synthesized DNA strand. POLγ is a highly accurate DNA polymerase with a frequency of misincorporation lower than 1 × 10−6. The accessory POLγB subunit enhances interactions with the DNA template and increases both the catalytic activity and the processivity of POLγA. The DNA helicase TWINKLE travels in front of POLγ, unwinding the double-stranded DNA template. TWINKLE forms a hexamer and requires a fork structure (a single-stranded 5′-DNA loading site and a short 3′-tail) to load and initiate unwinding. Mitochondrial single-stranded DNA-binding protein (mtSSB) binds to the formed ssDNA, protects it against nucleases, and prevents secondary structure formation The most accepted model of DNA replication in the mitochondria is the strand displacement model (Figure 9.24). Within this model, DNA synthesis is continuous on both the H- and L-strand. There is a dedicated origin for each strand, OH and OL. First, replication is initiated at OH and DNA synthesis then proceeds to produce a new H-strand. During the initial phase, there is no simultaneous L-strand synthesis and mtSSB covers the displaced, parental H-strand. By binding to single-stranded DNA, mtSSB prevents the mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) from initiating random RNA synthesis on the displaced strand. When the replication fork has progressed about two-thirds of the genome, it passes the second origin of replication, OL. When exposed in its single-stranded conformation, the parental H-strand at OL folds into a stem–loop structure. The stem efficiently blocks mtSSB from binding and a short stretch of single-stranded DNA in the loop region therefore remains accessible, allowing POLRMT to initiate RNA synthesis. POLRMT is not processive on single-stranded DNA templates. After adding approximately 25 nucleotides, it is replaced by POLγ and L-strand DNA synthesis is initiated. From this point, H- and L-strand synthesis proceeds continuously until the two strands have reached full circle. Replication of the two strands is linked, since H-strand synthesis is required for initiation of L-strand synthesis. DNA Ligase III is used to complete the ligation of the newly formed DNA strands. During DNA replication, the parental molecule remains intact, which poses a steric problem for the moving replication machinery. Topoisomerases belonging to the type 1 family can relieve torsional strain formed in this way, by allowing one of the strands to pass through the other. In mammalian mitochondria, TOP1MT a type IB enzyme can act as a DNA “swivel”, working together with the mitochondrial replisome. Furthermore, replication of circular DNA often causes the formation of catenanes, or interlocked circles that need to be separated from one another. The type 1A topoisomerase, topoisomerase 3α (Top3α), is required to resolve the hemicatenane structure that can form during mtDNA replication. Figure 9.24 Replication of the human mitochondrial genome. Mitochondrial DNA replication is initiated at OH and proceeds unidirectionally to produce the full-length nascent H-strand. mtSSB binds and protects the exposed, parental H-strand. When the replisome passes OL, a stem–loop structure is formed that blocks mtSSB binding, presenting a single-stranded loop-region from which POLRMT can initiate primer synthesis. The transition to L-strand DNA synthesis takes place after about 25 nt, when POLγ replaces POLRMT at the 3′-end of the primer. Synthesis of the two strands proceeds in a continuous manner until two full, double-stranded DNA molecules have been formed. Figure from: Curiously, not all replication events initiated at OH continue to full circle. Instead, 95% are terminated after about the first 650 nucleotides at a sequence known as the termination associated sequences (TAS) (Figure 9.23). This creates a short DNA fragment known as the 7S DNA, that remains bound to the parental L-strand, while the parental H-strand is displaced (Figure 9.23). As a result, a triple-stranded displacement loop structure, a D-loop, is formed. The functional importance of the D-loop structure is unclear and how replication is terminated at TAS is also not known. 9.6 Telomeres and Replicative Senescence The End Replication Problem In humans, telomeres consist of hundreds to thousands of repetitive sequences of TTAGGG at chromosomal ends for maintaining genomic integrity. Because the DNA replication is asymmetric along double strands, RNA pimer sequence at the 3′-hydroxyl end cannot be replaced by DNA polymerase I, as there is no 3′-OH primer group present for the polymerase to extend the DNA chain. This causes the loss of 30–200 nucleotides with each DNA replication and cell division and is known as the end replication problem. Telomeres provide a repetitive noncoding sequence of DNA at the 3′ end to prevent the loss of critical genetically encoded information during replication. Moreover, telomeres are coated with a complex of six capping proteins, also known as shelterin proteins, which are packed into a compact T-loop structure that hides the ends of the chromosomes. This prevents the DNA repair machinery from mistaking chromosomal ends for double-stranded DNA breaks (Figure 9.25). Therefore, telomeres have been proposed as a mitotic clock that measures how many times a cell has divided and in essence, gives a cell a defined lifetime. Figure 9.25 Telomere Structure. (A) Telomeres are located at the end of chromosomes, where they help protect against the loss of DNA during replication. (B) DNA quadruplex formed by telomere repeats. The looped conformation of the DNA backbone is very different from the typical DNA helix, this is known as T-loop formation. The green spheres in the center represent potassium ions. Image (A) by: and Image (B) by: The human telomerase enzyme is responsible for maintaining and elongating telomeres and consists of an RNA component (TERC) and a reverse transcriptase (TERT), that serves as the catalytic component (Figure 9.26). The TERT uses the TERC as a template to synthesize new telomeric DNA repeats at a single-stranded overhang to maintain telomere length (Figure 9.26). Some cells such as germ cells, stem cells, hematopoietic progenitor cells, activated lymphocytes, and most cancer cells constitutively express telomerase and maintain telomerase activity to overcome telomere shortening and cellular senescence. However, most other somatic cells generally have a low or undetectable level of telomerase activity and concomitantly limited longevity. Interestingly, overall telomerase activity decreases with age, but increases markedly in response to injury, suggesting a role for telomerase in cellular regeneration during wound healing. The telomere length and integrity are regulated through the interplay between the telomerase and shelterin proteins. Figure 9.26 Conceptual Model of Telomerase Activity. The active site of the telomerase enzyme contains the RNA template, TERC (shown in red) and aligns with the last few telomeric bases at the end of the chromosome (shown in blue). This creates a single stranded overhang that can be used as a template by the TERT reverse transcriptase to extend the telomere sequence. Figure by: In vivo, shortened telomeres and damaged telomeres generally caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) are usually assumed to be the main markers of cellular aging and are thought to be the main cause of replicative senescence. In vitro, telomeres loose approximately 50–200 bp at each division due to the end-replication problem. Approximately 100 mitoses are thought to be sufficient to reach the Hayflick limit, or the maximum number of mitotic events allowed prior to entering replicative senescence. Cells in continual renewal, such as blood cells, compensate for telomere erosion by expressing telomerase, the only enzyme able to polymerize telomeric sequences de novo at the extremity of telomeres. Knocking out telomerase components, such as the catalytic subunit (TERT) or the RNA template (TERC), induces several features of aging in mice. In humans, germline mutations in telomerase subunits are responsible for progeroïd syndromes, such as Dyskeratosis congenita, a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure. Furthermore, healthy lifespan in humans is positively correlated with longer telomere length and patients suffering from age-related diseases and premature aging have shorter telomeres compared with healthy individuals. An accumulation of unrepaired damage within telomeric regions has also been shown to accumulate in aging mice and non-human primates, suggesting that damage of telomeres with age may also be contributing to age-driven disease states and reduced healthspan. Thus, one could argue that the activation and expression of telomerase may be a way of reducing age-related diseases and increasing overall longevity. However, the constitutive expression of telomerase, unfortunately, is a characteristic of almost all cancer cells. It is therefore, no surprise that transgenic animals over-expressiong the catalytic subunit of telomerase (mTERT), develop cancers earlier in life. However, overexpression of telomerase in mice that are highly resistant to cancers has shown large increases in median lifespan and significantly reduced age-associated disorders. Since humans are not highly resistant to cancer, this is not a feasible option for humans. However, additional studies in mice, where constitutive expression of telomerase is only introduced into a small percentage of host cells using adenovirus gene therapy techniques has yielded more promising results. Adenoviruses are a group of viruses that form an icosahedral protein capsid that houses a linear double stranded DNA genome. Infections in humans typically cause symptoms of the common cold and are usually mild in nature. These are a good target for gene therapy, as the DNA that they carry can be mutated, so that they are deficient in their ability to replicate once they have infected the host. They can also be transformed to carry a gene-of-interest into the host, where that gene can then integrate into the host genome. Experiments in mice that were infected with an adenovirus carrying the mTERT gene showed that mTERT was delivered to a wide range of tissues within the body, and increased telomere length within those tissues. Furthermore, the mTERT expressing mice were healthier than their litter mates and displayed a reduction in disabling conditions associated with physiological aging such as osteoporosis and insulin resistance (Figure 9.27). Cognitive skills and metabolic functions were also improved. Noticeably, mice treated with gene therapy did not have increased incidence in cancer rates, suggesting that in at least the short-lived mouse species, that a gene therapy approach to increased telomerase activity is safe. Within these animals, median lifespan was increased by 24% when animals were treated at 1 year of age, and by 13% if treated at 2 years of age. Figure 9.27 Promoting Healthspan in Mice using a Telomerase Gene Therapy. Delivery of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (TERT) using a modified adenovirus vector (rAAV) suppresses aging associated telomere erosion and extends short telomoeres in a variety of tissues. Consequently, animals display improved healthspan and extended lifespan. Figure from: Replication and Repair of Telomere Sequences In addition to the end replication problem, telomeric DNA (telDNA) replication and repair is a real challenge due to the different structural features of telomeres. Firstly, the nucleotidic sequence itself consists of an hexanucleotidic motif (TTAGGG) repeated over kilobases, with the 5′-3′ strand named the “G-strand” due to its high content in guanine. During the progression of the replication fork, the lagging strand, corresponding to the G-strand, forms G-quadruplex (G4) structures, which have to be resolved to allow fork progression and to complete replication (Figure 9.28a). Secondly, R-loops corresponding to highly stable RNA:DNA hybrids, involving the long non-coding telomeric transcript TERRA (telomeric repeat-containing RNA) also have to be dissociated. Thirdly, the extremity of telomeres adopts a specific loop structure, the T-loop, which has to be unraveled. This is the loop that hides the double strand end from the DNA damage sensors, and is locked by the hybridization of the 3′ single strand overhang extremity with the above 3′-5′ strand, thereby displacing the corresponding 5′-3′ strand to form a D-loop (displacement loop) structure (Figure 9.28a). Lastly, replication also has to deal with barriers encountered elsewhere in the genome, such as torsions and a condensed heterochromatic environment. Figure 9.28 Obstacles and solutions to replicate telomeres. (a) Telomeric sequence, with the G-strand in solid red line and the C-strand in solid green line, is depicted. The terminal D-loop structuring the much larger T-loop is stabilized by the shelterin complex. The replisome (PCNA, pol ε, etc) polymerizes a new G-strand (depicted in dotted red line) and frees the parental G-strand, enabling the formation of G4 secondary structure. R-loops corresponding to TERRA hybridization (in dotted black lines) with the 3′-5′ strand, and torsions due to the fork progression are also shown. (b) Replication helpers, such as helicases, either helping in G4 unwinding or in D-loop unlocking are depicted. The DNAses (Top2a, DNA2) and RNAses (RNAse H1 and FEN1) help in resolving torsions and RNA:DNA heteroduplexes, while Timeless stimulates the replisome and POT1 competes with RPA1 for binding of the single-strand and helps in G4 dissolution. The shelterin components, POT1, TRF1 and TRF2 help in loading the helper-proteins (fine green arrows) Figure from: Since telomeres face a host of obstacles to completing the replication process, as discussed in Figure 9.28, the cell possess a set of specialized machinery to fully achieve their replication, such as the RTEL1, TRF1, and TRF2 proteins, DNAses, RNAsses, and Timeless. The recruitment of these factors is orchestrated by the shelterin complex. At the molecular level, the GGG telomeric repeats are particularly sensitive to ROS, which produce stretches of 8-oxoguanine that are especially difficult to repair. Coupled with inefficient telomere repair, these ROS-induced lesions produce single and double-strand breaks, and/or generate replicative stress, ultimately resulting in telomere shortening. The presence of unrepaired single or tandem 8-oxoguanine drastically inhibits the binding of TRF1 and TRF2, and impairs the recruitment of telomerase, especially when ROS damage is localized in the 3′ overhang. This type of damage contributes to telomere deprotection and shortening. Strikingly, ROS (and other metabolic stresses) also induce the relocation of TERT to mitochondria, as observed (i) in primary neurons after oxidative stress; (ii) in neurons exposed to the tau protein; (iii) in Purkinje neurons subjected to excitotoxicity; and (iv) in cancer cell lines treated with a G4 ligand. Mitochondrial TERT increases the inner membrane potential, as well as the mtDNA copy number, and decreases ROS production with a protective effect on mtDNA. Mitochondria are also critical sensors of cellular damage and contribute to the processes of autophagy and apoptosis (programmed cell death). The relocalization of TERT following chromosomal damage in the nucleus, may indicate one mechanism the mitochondria utilizes to monitor cellular stress and damage.

0,openstax,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://openstax.org/books/microbiology/pages/11-2-dna-replication,"DNA replication and the functions of the enzymes involved Identify the differences between DNA replication in bacteria and eukaryotes Explain the process of rolling circle replication The elucidation of the structure of the double helix by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953 provided a hint as to how DNA is copied during the process of replication. Separating the strands of the double helix would provide two templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands, but exactly how new DNA molecules were constructed was still unclear. In one model, semiconservative replication, the two strands of the double helix separate during DNA replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. There were two competing models also suggested: conservative and dispersive, which are shown in . Figure 11.4 There were three models suggested for DNA replication. In the conservative model, parental DNA strands (blue) remained associated in one DNA molecule while new daughter strands (red) remained associated in newly formed DNA molecules. In the semiconservative model, parental strands separated and directed the synthesis of a daughter strand, with each resulting DNA molecule being a hybrid of a parental strand and a daughter strand. In the dispersive model, all resulting DNA strands have regions of double-stranded parental DNA and regions of double-stranded daughter DNA. Matthew Meselson (1930–) and Franklin Stahl (1929–) devised an experiment in 1958 to test which of these models correctly represents DNA replication (). They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that was incorporated into nitrogenous bases and, eventually, into the DNA. This labeled the parental DNA. The E. coli culture was then shifted into a medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was separated by ultracentrifugation, during which the DNA formed bands according to its density. DNA grown in 15N would be expected to form a band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N or 14N. This suggested either a semiconservative or dispersive mode of replication. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more generation in 14N and spun again. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semiconservative manner. If DNA replication was dispersive, a single purple band positioned closer to the red 1414 would have been observed, as more 14 was added in a dispersive manner to replace 15. Therefore, the other two models were ruled out. As a result of this experiment, we now know that during DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. The resulting DNA molecules have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells. Figure 11.5 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (blue band) was heavier than DNA grown in 14N (red band), and sedimented to a lower level on ultracentrifugation. After one round of replication, the DNA sedimented halfway between the 15N and 14N levels (purple band), ruling out the conservative model of replication. After a second round of replication, the dispersive model of replication was ruled out. These data supported the semiconservative replication model. Check Your Understanding What would have been the conclusion of Meselson and Stahl’s experiment if, after the first generation, they had found two bands of DNA? DNA Replication in Bacteria DNA replication has been well studied in bacteria primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs (Mbp) in a single circular chromosome and all of it is replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle bidirectionally (i.e., in both directions). This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is quite rapid and occurs with few errors. DNA replication uses a large number of proteins and enzymes (). One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol. In bacteria, three main types of DNA polymerases are known: DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair. DNA pol III adds deoxyribonucleotides each complementary to a nucleotide on the template strand, one by one to the 3’-OH group of the growing DNA chain. The addition of these nucleotides requires energy. This energy is present in the bonds of three phosphate groups attached to each nucleotide (a triphosphate nucleotide), similar to how energy is stored in the phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (). When the bond between the phosphates is broken and diphosphate is released, the energy released allows for the formation of a covalent phosphodiester bond by dehydration synthesis between the incoming nucleotide and the free 3’-OH group on the growing DNA strand. Figure 11.6 This structure shows the guanosine triphosphate deoxyribonucleotide that is incorporated into a growing DNA strand by cleaving the two end phosphate groups from the molecule and transferring the energy to the sugar phosphate bond. The other three nucleotides form analogous structures. Initiation The initiation of replication occurs at specific nucleotide sequence called the origin of replication, where various proteins bind to begin the replication process. E. coli has a single origin of replication (as do most prokaryotes), called oriC, on its one chromosome. The origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in adenine-thymine (AT) sequences. Some of the proteins that bind to the origin of replication are important in making single-stranded regions of DNA accessible for replication. Chromosomal DNA is typically wrapped around histones (in eukaryotes and archaea) or histone-like proteins (in bacteria), and is supercoiled, or extensively wrapped and twisted on itself. This packaging makes the information in the DNA molecule inaccessible. However, enzymes called topoisomerases change the shape and supercoiling of the chromosome. For bacterial DNA replication to begin, the supercoiled chromosome is relaxed by topoisomerase II, also called DNA gyrase. An enzyme called helicase then separates the DNA strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. Recall that AT sequences have fewer hydrogen bonds and, hence, have weaker interactions than guanine-cytosine (GC) sequences. These enzymes require ATP hydrolysis. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication, allowing for bidirectional replication and formation of a structure that looks like a bubble when viewed with a transmission electron microscope; as a result, this structure is called a replication bubble. The DNA near each replication fork is coated with single-stranded binding proteins to prevent the single-stranded DNA from rewinding into a double helix. Once single-stranded DNA is accessible at the origin of replication, DNA replication can begin. However, DNA pol III is able to add nucleotides only in the 5’ to 3’ direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction). This is because DNA polymerase requires a free 3’-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a covalent phosphodiester bond between the 3’-OH end and the 5’ phosphate of the next nucleotide. This also means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3’-OH group is not available, which is the case for a single strand of DNA. The problem is solved with the help of an RNA sequence that provides the free 3’-OH end. Because this sequence allows the start of DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. The primer is five to 10 nucleotides long and complementary to the parental or template DNA. It is synthesized by RNA primase, which is an RNA polymerase. Unlike DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases do not need a free 3’-OH group to synthesize an RNA molecule. Now that the primer provides the free 3’-OH group, DNA polymerase III can now extend this RNA primer, adding DNA nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand (). Elongation During elongation in DNA replication, the addition of nucleotides occurs at its maximal rate of about 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase III can only extend in the 5’ to 3’ direction, which poses a problem at the replication fork. The DNA double helix is antiparallel; that is, one strand is oriented in the 5’ to 3’ direction and the other is oriented in the 3’ to 5’ direction (see ). During replication, one strand, which is complementary to the 3’ to 5’ parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork because polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5’ to 3’ parental DNA, grows away from the replication fork, so the polymerase must move back toward the replication fork to begin adding bases to a new primer, again in the direction away from the replication fork. It does so until it bumps into the previously synthesized strand and then it moves back again (). These steps produce small DNA sequence fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each separated by RNA primer. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese research team and married couple Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki, who first discovered them in 1966. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand, and its synthesis is said to be discontinuous. The leading strand can be extended from one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3’ to 5’, and that of the leading strand 5’ to 3’. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Beyond its role in initiation, topoisomerase also prevents the overwinding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, and the gaps are filled in. The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of covalent phosphodiester linkage between the 3’-OH end of one DNA fragment and the 5’ phosphate end of the other fragment, stabilizing the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule. Figure 11.7 At the origin of replication, topoisomerase II relaxes the supercoiled chromosome. Two replication forks are formed by the opening of the double-stranded DNA at the origin, and helicase separates the DNA strands, which are coated by single-stranded binding proteins to keep the strands separated. DNA replication occurs in both directions. An RNA primer complementary to the parental strand is synthesized by RNA primase and is elongated by DNA polymerase III through the addition of nucleotides to the 3’-OH end. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. RNA primers within the lagging strand are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, and the Okazaki fragments are joined by DNA ligase. Termination Once the complete chromosome has been replicated, termination of DNA replication must occur. Although much is known about initiation of replication, less is known about the termination process. Following replication, the resulting complete circular genomes of prokaryotes are concatenated, meaning that the circular DNA chromosomes are interlocked and must be separated from each other. This is accomplished through the activity of bacterial topoisomerase IV, which introduces double-stranded breaks into DNA molecules, allowing them to separate from each other; the enzyme then reseals the circular chromosomes. The resolution of concatemers is an issue unique to prokaryotic DNA replication because of their circular chromosomes. Because both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are distinct from their eukaryotic counterparts, these enzymes serve as targets for a class of antimicrobial drugs called quinolones. The Molecular Machinery Involved in Bacterial DNA Replication Enzyme or Factor Function DNA pol I Exonuclease activity removes RNA primer and replaces it with newly synthesized DNA DNA pol III Main enzyme that adds nucleotides in the 5’ to 3’ direction Helicase Opens the DNA helix by breaking hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous bases Ligase Seals the gaps between the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand to create one continuous DNA strand Primase Synthesizes RNA primers needed to start replication Single-stranded binding proteins Bind to single-stranded DNA to prevent hydrogen bonding between DNA strands, reforming double-stranded DNA Sliding clamp Helps hold DNA pol III in place when nucleotides are being added Topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) Relaxes supercoiled chromosome to make DNA more accessible for the initiation of replication; helps relieve the stress on DNA when unwinding, by causing breaks and then resealing the DNA Topoisomerase IV Introduces single-stranded break into concatenated chromosomes to release them from each other, and then reseals the DNA Table 11.1 Check Your Understanding Which enzyme breaks the hydrogen bonds holding the two strands of DNA together so that replication can occur? Is it the lagging strand or the leading strand that is synthesized in the direction toward the opening of the replication fork? Which enzyme is responsible for removing the RNA primers in newly replicated bacterial DNA? DNA Replication in Eukaryotes Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger than prokaryotic genomes and are typically composed of multiple linear chromosomes (). The human genome, for example, has 3 billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are inserted during replication. There are multiple origins of replication on each eukaryotic chromosome (); the human genome has 30,000 to 50,000 origins of replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second—10 times slower than prokaryotic replication. Figure 11.8 Eukaryotic chromosomes are typically linear, and each contains multiple origins of replication. The essential steps of replication in eukaryotes are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available as a template. Eukaryotic DNA is highly supercoiled and packaged, which is facilitated by many proteins, including histones (see ). At the origin of replication, a prereplication complex composed of several proteins, including helicase, forms and recruits other enzymes involved in the initiation of replication, including topoisomerase to relax supercoiling, single-stranded binding protein, RNA primase, and DNA polymerase. Following initiation of replication, in a process similar to that found in prokaryotes, elongation is facilitated by eukaryotic DNA polymerases. The leading strand is continuously synthesized by the eukaryotic polymerase enzyme pol δ, while the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε. A sliding clamp protein holds the DNA polymerase in place so that it does not fall off the DNA. The enzyme ribonuclease H (RNase H), instead of a DNA polymerase as in bacteria, removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase. Because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, one might expect that their replication would be more straightforward. As in prokaryotes, the eukaryotic DNA polymerase can add nucleotides only in the 5’ to 3’ direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until it reaches either the end of the chromosome or another replication fork progressing in the opposite direction. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place to make a primer for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired and, over time, they may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres and consist of noncoding repetitive sequences. The telomeres protect coding sequences from being lost as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base-pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times to form the telomere. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase () clarified our understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. Telomerase contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3’ end of the DNA strand. Once the 3’ end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated. In humans, telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells; it is not active in adult somatic cells and may be associated with the aging of these cells. Eukaryotic microbes including fungi and protozoans also produce telomerase to maintain chromosomal integrity. For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (1948–) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 2009. Figure 11.9 In eukaryotes, the ends of the linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.

Organization of the Nucleus and Its DNA Like most other cellular organelles, the nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear envelope. This membranous covering consists of two adjacent lipid bilayers with a thin fluid space in between them. Spanning these two bilayers are nuclear pores. A nuclear pore is a tiny passageway for the passage of proteins, RNA, and solutes between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Proteins called pore complexes lining the nuclear pores regulate the passage of materials into and out of the nucleus. Inside the nuclear envelope is a gel-like nucleoplasm with solutes that include the building blocks of nucleic acids. There also can be a dark-staining mass often visible under a simple light microscope, called a nucleolus (plural = nucleoli). The nucleolus is a region of the nucleus that is responsible for manufacturing the RNA necessary for construction of ribosomes. Once synthesized, newly made ribosomal subunits exit the cell’s nucleus through the nuclear pores. The genetic instructions that are used to build and maintain an organism are arranged in an orderly manner in strands of DNA. Within the nucleus are threads of chromatin composed of DNA and associated proteins (). Along the chromatin threads, the DNA is wrapped around a set of histone proteins. A nucleosome is a single, wrapped DNA-histone complex. Multiple nucleosomes along the entire molecule of DNA appear like a beaded necklace, in which the string is the DNA and the beads are the associated histones. When a cell is in the process of division, the chromatin condenses into chromosomes, so that the DNA can be safely transported to the “daughter cells.” The chromosome is composed of DNA and proteins; it is the condensed form of chromatin. It is estimated that humans have almost 22,000 genes distributed on 46 chromosomes. DNA Macrostructure Strands of DNA are wrapped around supporting histones. These proteins are increasingly bundled and condensed into chromatin, which is packed tightly into chromosomes when the cell is ready to divide. DNA Replication In order for an organism to grow, develop, and maintain its health, cells must reproduce themselves by dividing to produce two new daughter cells, each with the full complement of DNA as found in the original cell. Billions of new cells are produced in an adult human every day. Only very few cell types in the body do not divide, including nerve cells, skeletal muscle fibers, and cardiac muscle cells. The division time of different cell types varies. Epithelial cells of the skin and gastrointestinal lining, for instance, divide very frequently to replace those that are constantly being rubbed off of the surface by friction. A DNA molecule is made of two strands that “complement” each other in the sense that the molecules that compose the strands fit together and bind to each other, creating a double-stranded molecule that looks much like a long, twisted ladder. Each side rail of the DNA ladder is composed of alternating sugar and phosphate groups (). The two sides of the ladder are not identical, but are complementary. These two backbones are bonded to each other across pairs of protruding bases, each bonded pair forming one “rung,” or cross member. The four DNA bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Because of their shape and charge, the two bases that compose a pair always bond together. Adenine always binds with thymine, and cytosine always binds with guanine. The particular sequence of bases along the DNA molecule determines the genetic code. Therefore, if the two complementary strands of DNA were pulled apart, you could infer the order of the bases in one strand from the bases in the other, complementary strand. For example, if one strand has a region with the sequence AGTGCCT, then the sequence of the complementary strand would be TCACGGA. Molecular Structure of DNA The DNA double helix is composed of two complementary strands. The strands are bonded together via their nitrogenous base pairs using hydrogen bonds. DNA replication is the copying of DNA that occurs before cell division can take place. After a great deal of debate and experimentation, the general method of DNA replication was deduced in 1958 by two scientists in California, Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl. This method is illustrated in and described below. DNA Replication DNA replication faithfully duplicates the entire genome of the cell. During DNA replication, a number of different enzymes work together to pull apart the two strands so each strand can be used as a template to synthesize new complementary strands. The two new daughter DNA molecules each contain one pre-existing strand and one newly synthesized strand. Thus, DNA replication is said to be “semiconservative.” Stage 1: Initiation. The two complementary strands are separated, much like unzipping a zipper. Special enzymes, including helicase, untwist and separate the two strands of DNA. Stage 2: Elongation. Each strand becomes a template along which a new complementary strand is built. DNA polymerase brings in the correct bases to complement the template strand, synthesizing a new strand base by base. A DNA polymerase is an enzyme that adds free nucleotides to the end of a chain of DNA, making a new double strand. This growing strand continues to be built until it has fully complemented the template strand. Stage 3: Termination. Once the two original strands are bound to their own, finished, complementary strands, DNA replication is stopped and the two new identical DNA molecules are complete. Each new DNA molecule contains one strand from the original molecule and one newly synthesized strand. The term for this mode of replication is “semiconservative,” because half of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each new DNA molecule. This process continues until the cell’s entire genome, the entire complement of an organism’s DNA, is replicated. As you might imagine, it is very important that DNA replication take place precisely so that new cells in the body contain the exact same genetic material as their parent cells. Mistakes made during DNA replication, such as the accidental addition of an inappropriate nucleotide, have the potential to render a gene dysfunctional or useless. Fortunately, there are mechanisms in place to minimize such mistakes. A DNA proofreading process enlists the help of special enzymes that scan the newly synthesized molecule for mistakes and corrects them. Once the process of DNA replication is complete, the cell is ready to divide. You will explore the process of cell division later in the chapter. Watch this to learn about DNA replication. DNA replication proceeds simultaneously at several sites on the same molecule. What separates the base pair at the start of DNA replication? Chapter Review The nucleus is the command center of the cell, containing the genetic instructions for all of the materials a cell will make (and thus all of its functions it can perform). The nucleus is encased within a membrane of two interconnected lipid bilayers, side-by-side. This nuclear envelope is studded with protein-lined pores that allow materials to be trafficked into and out of the nucleus. The nucleus contains one or more nucleoli, which serve as sites for ribosome synthesis. The nucleus houses the genetic material of the cell: DNA. DNA is normally found as a loosely contained structure called chromatin within the nucleus, where it is wound up and associated with a variety of histone proteins. When a cell is about to divide, the chromatin coils tightly and condenses to form chromosomes. There is a pool of cells constantly dividing within your body. The result is billions of new cells being created each day. Before any cell is ready to divide, it must replicate its DNA so that each new daughter cell will receive an exact copy of the organism’s genome. A variety of enzymes are enlisted during DNA replication. These enzymes unwind the DNA molecule, separate the two strands, and assist with the building of complementary strands along each parent strand. The original DNA strands serve as templates from which the nucleotide sequence of the new strands are determined and synthesized. When replication is completed, two identical DNA molecules exist. Each one contains one original strand and one newly synthesized complementary strand. Interactive Link Questions Watch this to learn about DNA replication.

DNA replication is said to be semiconservative because, after replication is complete, one of the two parent DNA strands makes up half of each new DNA molecule. The other half is a newly synthesized strand. Therefore, half (“semi”) of each daughter DNA molecule is from the parent molecule and half is a new molecule. Why is it important that DNA replication take place before cell division? What would happen if cell division of a body cell took place without DNA replication, or when DNA replication was incomplete? During cell division, one cell divides to produce two new cells. In order for all of the cells in your body to maintain a full genome, each cell must replicate its DNA before it divides so that a full genome can be allotted to each of its offspring cells. If DNA replication did not take place fully, or at all, the offspring cells would be missing some or all of the genome. This could be disastrous if a cell was missing genes necessary for its function and health. Glossary chromatin substance consisting of DNA"

DNA replicationDNA replication occurs during the S phase of the , illustrated below. This happens within the nucleus in . The DNA replication that occurs in all living is termed as semiconservative, meaning that the new DNA molecule will have one original strand (also called the parental strand) and one new strand of DNA. This model of DNA replication is most widely accepted, but another model termed conservative replication was also put forward. At the end of this article, we will discuss the evidence as to why semiconservative replication is the accepted model. Fig. 1 - The phases of the cell cycleSemiconservative DNA replication steps Semiconservative replication states that each strand of the original DNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a new DNA strand. The steps for replication outlined below must be accurately executed with high fidelity to prevent the daughter from containing mutated DNA, which is DNA that has been replicated incorrectly.The DNA double helix unzips due to the enzyme DNA helicase . This enzyme breaks the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs. A replication fork is created, which is the Y-shaped structure of the DNA unzipping. Each 'branch' of the fork is a single strand of exposed DNA.Free DNA in the nucleus will pair with their complementary base on the exposed DNA template strands. Hydrogen bonds will form between the complementary base pairs. The enzyme DNA polymerase forms phosphodiester bonds between adjacent in condensation reactions. DNA polymerase binds to the 3 'end of DNA which means the new DNA strand is extending in the 5' to 3 'direction.Remember: the DNA double helix is anti-parallel!Fig. 2 - The semiconservative DNA replication stepsContinuous and discontinuous replication DNA polymerase, the enzyme which catalyses the formation of phosphodiester bonds, can only make new DNA strands in the 5 'to 3' direction. This strand is called the leading strand and this undergoes continuous replication as it is being continuously synthesized by DNA polymerase, which travels towards the replication fork. This means the other new DNA strand needs to be synthesized in the 3 'to 5' direction. But how does that work if DNA polymerase travels in the opposite direction? This new strand termed the lagging strand is synthesized in fragments, called Okazaki fragments. Discontinuous replication occurs in this case as DNA polymerase travels away from the replication fork. The Okazaki fragments need to be joined together by phosphodiester bonds and this is catalysed by another enzyme called DNA ligase. What are the DNA replication enzymes? Semiconservative DNA replication relies on the action of . The 3 main involved are:DNA helicaseDNA polymeraseDNA ligaseDNA helicase DNA helicase is involved in the early steps of DNA replication. It breaks the hydrogen bonds between the complementary base pairs to expose the bases on the original strand of DNA. This allows free DNA to attach to their complementary pair. DNA polymerase DNA polymerase catalyses the formation of new phosphodiester bonds between the free in condensation reactions. This creates the new polynucleotide strand of DNA. DNA ligase DNA ligase works to join Okazaki fragments together during discontinuous replication through catalyzing the formation of phosphodiester bonds. Although both DNA polymerase and DNA ligase form phosphodiester bonds, both are needed as they each have different active sites for their specific substrates. DNA ligase is also a key enzyme involved in recombinant DNA technology with plasmid vectors.Evidence for semiconservative DNA replication Two models of DNA replication have historically been put forward: conservative and semiconservative DNA replication. The conservative DNA replication model suggests that after one round, you are left with the original DNA molecule and an entirely new DNA molecule made of new . The semiconservative DNA replication model, however, suggests that after one round, the two DNA molecules contain one original strand of DNA and one new strand of DNA. This is the model we explored earlier in this article. Meselson and Stahl experiment In the 1950s, two scientists named Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl performed an experiment that led to the semiconservative model becoming widely accepted in the scientific community.So how did they do this? The DNA contain nitrogen within the organic bases and Meselson and Stahl knew there were 2 isotopes of nitrogen: N15 and N14, with N15 being the heavier isotopes. The scientists began by culturing E. coli in a medium containing only N15, which led to the taking up the nitrogen and incorporating it into their DNA . This effectively labelled the with N15. The same were then cultured in a different medium containing only N14 and were allowed to divide over several generations. Meselson and Stahl wanted to measure the DNA density and thus the amount of N15 and N14 in the so they centrifuged samples after each generation. In the samples, DNA that is lighter in weight will appear higher in the sample tube than DNA that is heavier. These were their results after each generation: Generation 0: 1 single band. This indicates the only contained N15.Generation 1: 1 single band in an intermediate position relative to Generation 0 and the N14 control. This indicates that the DNA molecule is made of both N15 and N14 and thus has an intermediate density. The semiconservative DNA replication model predicted this outcome. Generation 2: 2 bands with 1 band in the intermediate position which contains both N15 and N14 (like Generation 1) and the other band positioned higher, which contains only N14. This band is positioned higher than N14 has a lower density than N15.Fig. 3 - Illustration of the findings of the Meselson and Stahl experimentThe evidence from Meselson and Stahl's experiment demonstrates that each DNA strand acts as a template for a new strand and that, after each round of replication, the resulting DNA molecule contains both an original and a new strand. As a result, the scientists concluded that DNA replicates in a semiconservative manner. DNA Replication - Key takeawaysDNA replication happens before cell division during the S phase and is important for ensuring each daughter cell contains the correct amount of genetic information.Semiconservative DNA replication state that the new DNA molecule will contain one original DNA strand and one new DNA strand. This was proved correct by Meselson and Stahl in the 1950s. The main enzymes involved in DNA replication are DNA helicase, DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. Frequently Asked Questions about DNA replication What is DNA replication? DNA replication is the copying of the DNA found within the nucleus before cell division. This process happens during the S phase of the cell cycle. Why is DNA replication important? DNA replication is important because it ensures that the resulting daughter cells contain the correct amount of genetic material. DNA replication is also a necessary step for cell division, and cell division is highly important for the growth and repair of tissues, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction. What are the steps of DNA replication? DNA helicase unzips the double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds. Free DNA nucleotides will match with their complementary base pair on the now-exposed DNA strands.

0,zmescience,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/genetic/dna-replication-steps-43264/,"DNA must be replicated to ensure that each new cell receives the correct number of chromosomes. This process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance. DNA replication occurs in several steps that involve multiple proteins called replication enzymes, as well as RNA. DNA replication is vital for cell growth, repair, and reproduction in organisms. The basic steps of DNA replication are: The DNA double helix is unwound and separated into two strands. Enzymes create short RNA primers on each strand. DNA polymerase enzymes add nucleotides to the new strand in the 5' to 3' direction. Nucleotides are added continuously on the leading strand. Nucleotides are added in short fragments called Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. DNA polymerase removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA nucleotides. Ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together on the lagging strand. The result is two identical copies of the original DNA molecule. DNA replication steps There are three main steps to DNA replication: initiation, elongation, and termination. In order to fit within a cell's nucleus, DNA is packed into tightly coiled structures called chromatin, which loosens prior to replication, allowing the cell replication machinery to access the DNA strands. Before DNA replication can begin, the double helix structure of the DNA molecules has to be 'unzipped.' Helicase, an enzyme, is integral to this process, breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold the complementary bases of DNA together (A with T and C with G). The separation creates a 'Y' shape called a replication fork and the two single strands of DNA"

Separating the strands of the double helix would provide two templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands, but exactly how new DNA molecules were constructed was still unclear. In one model, semiconservative replication, the two strands of the double helix separate during DNA replication, and each strand serves as a template from which the new complementary strand is copied; after replication, each double-stranded DNA includes one parental or “old” strand and one “new” strand. There were two competing models also suggested: conservative and dispersive, which are shown in . Figure 11.4 There were three models suggested for DNA replication. In the conservative model, parental DNA strands (blue) remained associated in one DNA molecule while new daughter strands (red) remained associated in newly formed DNA molecules. In the semiconservative model, parental strands separated and directed the synthesis of a daughter strand, with each resulting DNA molecule being a hybrid of a parental strand and a daughter strand. In the dispersive model, all resulting DNA strands have regions of double-stranded parental DNA and regions of double-stranded daughter DNA. Matthew Meselson (1930–) and Franklin Stahl (1929–) devised an experiment in 1958 to test which of these models correctly represents DNA replication (). They grew E. coli for several generations in a medium containing a “heavy” isotope of nitrogen (15N) that was incorporated into nitrogenous bases and, eventually, into the DNA. This labeled the parental DNA. The E. coli culture was then shifted into a medium containing 14N and allowed to grow for one generation. The cells were harvested and the DNA was isolated. The DNA was separated by ultracentrifugation, during which the DNA formed bands according to its density. DNA grown in 15N would be expected to form a band at a higher density position than that grown in 14N. Meselson and Stahl noted that after one generation of growth in 14N, the single band observed was intermediate in position in between DNA of cells grown exclusively in 15N or 14N. This suggested either a semiconservative or dispersive mode of replication. Some cells were allowed to grow for one more generation in 14N and spun again. The DNA harvested from cells grown for two generations in 14N formed two bands: one DNA band was at the intermediate position between 15N and 14N, and the other corresponded to the band of 14N DNA. These results could only be explained if DNA replicates in a semiconservative manner. If DNA replication was dispersive, a single purple band positioned closer to the red 1414 would have been observed, as more 14 was added in a dispersive manner to replace 15. Therefore, the other two models were ruled out. As a result of this experiment, we now know that during DNA replication, each of the two strands that make up the double helix serves as a template from which new strands are copied. The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. The resulting DNA molecules have the same sequence and are divided equally into the two daughter cells. Figure 11.5 Meselson and Stahl experimented with E. coli grown first in heavy nitrogen (15N) then in 14N. DNA grown in 15N (blue band) was heavier than DNA grown in 14N (red band), and sedimented to a lower level on ultracentrifugation. After one round of replication, the DNA sedimented halfway between the 15N and 14N levels (purple band), ruling out the conservative model of replication. After a second round of replication, the dispersive model of replication was ruled out. These data supported the semiconservative replication model. Check Your Understanding What would have been the conclusion of Meselson and Stahl’s experiment if, after the first generation, they had found two bands of DNA? DNA Replication in Bacteria DNA replication has been well studied in bacteria primarily because of the small size of the genome and the mutants that are available. E. coli has 4.6 million base pairs (Mbp) in a single circular chromosome and all of it is replicated in approximately 42 minutes, starting from a single origin of replication and proceeding around the circle bidirectionally (i.e., in both directions). This means that approximately 1000 nucleotides are added per second. The process is quite rapid and occurs with few errors. DNA replication uses a large number of proteins and enzymes (). One of the key players is the enzyme DNA polymerase, also known as DNA pol. In bacteria, three main types of DNA polymerases are known: DNA pol I, DNA pol II, and DNA pol III. It is now known that DNA pol III is the enzyme required for DNA synthesis; DNA pol I and DNA pol II are primarily required for repair. DNA pol III adds deoxyribonucleotides each complementary to a nucleotide on the template strand, one by one to the 3’-OH group of the growing DNA chain. The addition of these nucleotides requires energy. This energy is present in the bonds of three phosphate groups attached to each nucleotide (a triphosphate nucleotide), similar to how energy is stored in the phosphate bonds of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (). When the bond between the phosphates is broken and diphosphate is released, the energy released allows for the formation of a covalent phosphodiester bond by dehydration synthesis between the incoming nucleotide and the free 3’-OH group on the growing DNA strand. Figure 11.6 This structure shows the guanosine triphosphate deoxyribonucleotide that is incorporated into a growing DNA strand by cleaving the two end phosphate groups from the molecule and transferring the energy to the sugar phosphate bond. The other three nucleotides form analogous structures. Initiation The initiation of replication occurs at specific nucleotide sequence called the origin of replication, where various proteins bind to begin the replication process. E. coli has a single origin of replication (as do most prokaryotes), called oriC, on its one chromosome. The origin of replication is approximately 245 base pairs long and is rich in adenine-thymine (AT) sequences. Some of the proteins that bind to the origin of replication are important in making single-stranded regions of DNA accessible for replication. Chromosomal DNA is typically wrapped around histones (in eukaryotes and archaea) or histone-like proteins (in bacteria), and is supercoiled, or extensively wrapped and twisted on itself. This packaging makes the information in the DNA molecule inaccessible. However, enzymes called topoisomerases change the shape and supercoiling of the chromosome. For bacterial DNA replication to begin, the supercoiled chromosome is relaxed by topoisomerase II, also called DNA gyrase. An enzyme called helicase then separates the DNA strands by breaking the hydrogen bonds between the nitrogenous base pairs. Recall that AT sequences have fewer hydrogen bonds and, hence, have weaker interactions than guanine-cytosine (GC) sequences. These enzymes require ATP hydrolysis. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed. Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication, allowing for bidirectional replication and formation of a structure that looks like a bubble when viewed with a transmission electron microscope; as a result, this structure is called a replication bubble. The DNA near each replication fork is coated with single-stranded binding proteins to prevent the single-stranded DNA from rewinding into a double helix. Once single-stranded DNA is accessible at the origin of replication, DNA replication can begin. However, DNA pol III is able to add nucleotides only in the 5’ to 3’ direction (a new DNA strand can be only extended in this direction). This is because DNA polymerase requires a free 3’-OH group to which it can add nucleotides by forming a covalent phosphodiester bond between the 3’-OH end and the 5’ phosphate of the next nucleotide. This also means that it cannot add nucleotides if a free 3’-OH group is not available, which is the case for a single strand of DNA. The problem is solved with the help of an RNA sequence that provides the free 3’-OH end. Because this sequence allows the start of DNA synthesis, it is appropriately called the primer. The primer is five to 10 nucleotides long and complementary to the parental or template DNA. It is synthesized by RNA primase, which is an RNA polymerase. Unlike DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases do not need a free 3’-OH group to synthesize an RNA molecule. Now that the primer provides the free 3’-OH group, DNA polymerase III can now extend this RNA primer, adding DNA nucleotides one by one that are complementary to the template strand (). Elongation During elongation in DNA replication, the addition of nucleotides occurs at its maximal rate of about 1000 nucleotides per second. DNA polymerase III can only extend in the 5’ to 3’ direction, which poses a problem at the replication fork. The DNA double helix is antiparallel; that is, one strand is oriented in the 5’ to 3’ direction and the other is oriented in the 3’ to 5’ direction (see ). During replication, one strand, which is complementary to the 3’ to 5’ parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork because polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. The other strand, complementary to the 5’ to 3’ parental DNA, grows away from the replication fork, so the polymerase must move back toward the replication fork to begin adding bases to a new primer, again in the direction away from the replication fork. It does so until it bumps into the previously synthesized strand and then it moves back again (). These steps produce small DNA sequence fragments known as Okazaki fragments, each separated by RNA primer. Okazaki fragments are named after the Japanese research team and married couple Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki, who first discovered them in 1966. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand, and its synthesis is said to be discontinuous. The leading strand can be extended from one primer alone, whereas the lagging strand needs a new primer for each of the short Okazaki fragments. The overall direction of the lagging strand will be 3’ to 5’, and that of the leading strand 5’ to 3’. A protein called the sliding clamp holds the DNA polymerase in place as it continues to add nucleotides. The sliding clamp is a ring-shaped protein that binds to the DNA and holds the polymerase in place. Beyond its role in initiation, topoisomerase also prevents the overwinding of the DNA double helix ahead of the replication fork as the DNA is opening up; it does so by causing temporary nicks in the DNA helix and then resealing it. As synthesis proceeds, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA. The primers are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, and the gaps are filled in. The nicks that remain between the newly synthesized DNA (that replaced the RNA primer) and the previously synthesized DNA are sealed by the enzyme DNA ligase that catalyzes the formation of covalent phosphodiester linkage between the 3’-OH end of one DNA fragment and the 5’ phosphate end of the other fragment, stabilizing the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA molecule. Figure 11.7 At the origin of replication, topoisomerase II relaxes the supercoiled chromosome. Two replication forks are formed by the opening of the double-stranded DNA at the origin, and helicase separates the DNA strands, which are coated by single-stranded binding proteins to keep the strands separated. DNA replication occurs in both directions. An RNA primer complementary to the parental strand is synthesized by RNA primase and is elongated by DNA polymerase III through the addition of nucleotides to the 3’-OH end. On the leading strand, DNA is synthesized continuously, whereas on the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches called Okazaki fragments. RNA primers within the lagging strand are removed by the exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I, and the Okazaki fragments are joined by DNA ligase. Termination Once the complete chromosome has been replicated, termination of DNA replication must occur. Although much is known about initiation of replication, less is known about the termination process. Following replication, the resulting complete circular genomes of prokaryotes are concatenated, meaning that the circular DNA chromosomes are interlocked and must be separated from each other. This is accomplished through the activity of bacterial topoisomerase IV, which introduces double-stranded breaks into DNA molecules, allowing them to separate from each other; the enzyme then reseals the circular chromosomes. The resolution of concatemers is an issue unique to prokaryotic DNA replication because of their circular chromosomes. Because both bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV are distinct from their eukaryotic counterparts, these enzymes serve as targets for a class of antimicrobial drugs called quinolones.

Is it the lagging strand or the leading strand that is synthesized in the direction toward the opening of the replication fork? Which enzyme is responsible for removing the RNA primers in newly replicated bacterial DNA? DNA Replication in Eukaryotes Eukaryotic genomes are much more complex and larger than prokaryotic genomes and are typically composed of multiple linear chromosomes (). The human genome, for example, has 3 billion base pairs per haploid set of chromosomes, and 6 billion base pairs are inserted during replication. There are multiple origins of replication on each eukaryotic chromosome (); the human genome has 30,000 to 50,000 origins of replication. The rate of replication is approximately 100 nucleotides per second—10 times slower than prokaryotic replication. Figure 11.8 Eukaryotic chromosomes are typically linear, and each contains multiple origins of replication. The essential steps of replication in eukaryotes are the same as in prokaryotes. Before replication can start, the DNA has to be made available as a template. Eukaryotic DNA is highly supercoiled and packaged, which is facilitated by many proteins, including histones (see ). At the origin of replication, a prereplication complex composed of several proteins, including helicase, forms and recruits other enzymes involved in the initiation of replication, including topoisomerase to relax supercoiling, single-stranded binding protein, RNA primase, and DNA polymerase. Following initiation of replication, in a process similar to that found in prokaryotes, elongation is facilitated by eukaryotic DNA polymerases. The leading strand is continuously synthesized by the eukaryotic polymerase enzyme pol δ, while the lagging strand is synthesized by pol ε. A sliding clamp protein holds the DNA polymerase in place so that it does not fall off the DNA. The enzyme ribonuclease H (RNase H), instead of a DNA polymerase as in bacteria, removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides. The gaps that remain are sealed by DNA ligase. Because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, one might expect that their replication would be more straightforward. As in prokaryotes, the eukaryotic DNA polymerase can add nucleotides only in the 5’ to 3’ direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until it reaches either the end of the chromosome or another replication fork progressing in the opposite direction. On the lagging strand, DNA is synthesized in short stretches, each of which is initiated by a separate primer. When the replication fork reaches the end of the linear chromosome, there is no place to make a primer for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. These ends thus remain unpaired and, over time, they may get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres and consist of noncoding repetitive sequences. The telomeres protect coding sequences from being lost as cells continue to divide. In humans, a six base-pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times to form the telomere. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase () clarified our understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. Telomerase contains a catalytic part and a built-in RNA template. It attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the 3’ end of the DNA strand. Once the 3’ end of the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can add the nucleotides complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated. In humans, telomerase is typically active in germ cells and adult stem cells; it is not active in adult somatic cells and may be associated with the aging of these cells. Eukaryotic microbes including fungi and protozoans also produce telomerase to maintain chromosomal integrity. For her discovery of telomerase and its action, Elizabeth Blackburn (1948–) received the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 2009. Figure 11.9 In eukaryotes, the ends of the linear chromosomes are maintained by the action of the telomerase enzyme.

This process occurs in all living organisms and is the basis for biological inheritance. DNA replication occurs in several steps that involve multiple proteins called replication enzymes, as well as RNA. DNA replication is vital for cell growth, repair, and reproduction in organisms. The basic steps of DNA replication are: The DNA double helix is unwound and separated into two strands. Enzymes create short RNA primers on each strand. DNA polymerase enzymes add nucleotides to the new strand in the 5' to 3' direction. Nucleotides are added continuously on the leading strand. Nucleotides are added in short fragments called Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. DNA polymerase removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA nucleotides. Ligase joins the Okazaki fragments together on the lagging strand. The result is two identical copies of the original DNA molecule. DNA replication steps There are three main steps to DNA replication: initiation, elongation, and termination. In order to fit within a cell's nucleus, DNA is packed into tightly coiled structures called chromatin, which loosens prior to replication, allowing the cell replication machinery to access the DNA strands. Before DNA replication can begin, the double helix structure of the DNA molecules has to be 'unzipped.' Helicase, an enzyme, is integral to this process, breaking the hydrogen bonds that hold the complementary bases of DNA together (A with T and C with G). The separation creates a 'Y' shape called a replication fork and the two single strands of DNA"
0,albert,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://www.albert.io/blog/what-occurs-in-the-s-phase/,"DNA replication has concluded, and the DNA is not damaged. This point is called a mitotic control point. Just before the cell exits the M phase another quality control takes place. Here chromosome alignment is checked, and the spindle attachment to all the chromosomes is checked. Before cells enter the S phase of interphase they go through the START or Restriction point; this is where the nutritional status of the cell is checked and, most importantly, DNA is checked again for damage. If you have been paying attention, you may have noticed that the integrity of DNA has already been checked once at the mitotic control point, this is because DNA integrity is arguably the most important thing in the cell. The S Phase of Interphase The S phase of a cell cycle occurs during interphase, before mitosis or meiosis, and is responsible for the synthesis or replication of DNA. In this way, the genetic material of a cell is doubled before it enters mitosis or meiosis, allowing there to be enough DNA to be split into daughter cells. The S phase only begins when the cell has passed the G1{ G }_{ 1 }G1​ checkpoint and has grown enough to contain double the DNA. S phase is halted by a protein called p16 until this happens. The p16 protein is vital in suppressing tumors and is responsible for preventing some cancers from happening. It counteracts the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase proteins which are responsible for signaling when the cell is ready to go through to the next phase. The kinases signal this by phosphorylating retinoblastoma protein (pRB) which when active tells the cell to move on to the next phase. The most important event occurring in S phase is the replication of DNA. The aim of this process is to produce double the amount of DNA, providing the basis for the chromosome sets of the daughter cells. DNA replication begins at a point where regulatory pre-replication complexes are attached to the DNA in the G1{ G }_{ 1 }G1​phase. These complexes act as a signal for where DNA replication should start. They are removed in the S phase before replication begins so that DNA replication doesn’t occur more than once. In addition to DNA replication, cell growth continues to occur through the S phase. Proteins and enzymes necessary for DNA synthesis continue to be produced. DNA Synthesis The DNA molecule is in the form of a double helix. During S phase, an enzyme called helicase unwinds the DNA strand, in the same way that you would unzip a zipper. The two single DNA strands can then be used as templates to form two identical double DNA strands. An enzyme called DNA polymerase then binds nucleotides to each of the single template DNA strands using the complementary base pairing rule: adenine binds to thymine, and cytosine binds to guanine. In this way, a new double helix of DNA is formed that is identical to the original. Figure 3: DNA synthesis occurring during the S phase. After all the DNA has been unzipped and synthesized into two new DNA"

0,biologydictionary,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://biologydictionary.net/dna-replication/,"DNA molecules. Because the double helix is anti-parallel and DNA polymerase only synthesizes new DNA from 5′-3′, the template strand reading 3′-5′ results in a continuous, leading strand, while the template strand reading 5′-3′ results in a discontinuous, lagging strand. Being a highly regulated process, multiple proteins are required both during and following replication to quickly correct mistakes and damages. DNA replication resulting in two identical DNA molecules from a single molecule Background Deoxyribonucleic acid, known simply as DNA, is the blueprint of all living things. DNA contains genes that code for the physical and metabolic information expressed in an individual while having the potential to be passed down to future offspring. Almost all cells have DNA, which is typically stored in the nucleus. Notable cells that lack DNA include anucleate cells (or cells that lack a nucleus, such as red blood cells). Additionally, some cells may still have DNA despite not having a nucleus, such as with bacterial cells. DNA Nucleotides DNA is made up of four building block monomers that are known as nucleotides. Nucleotides consists of three groups: A deoxyribose sugar group A phosphate group A nitrogenous base DNA nucleotides pairing with complimentary bases. P= phosphate group; D= deoxyribose sugar group; A= adenine; C= cytosine; T= Thymine; G= Guanine All of the nucleotides have the same sugar group and phosphate group, but different nitrogenous bases. The nitrogenous bases in DNA are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine. Adenine and guanine are classified as purines, while cytosine and thymine are classified as pyrimidines. Purines have two rings in their base structures, while pyrimidines have a single ring in their base structures. (Helpful hint: A simple pneumonic to remember adenine and guanine as purines is “Pure As Gold”!) DNA Structure Nucleotides are arranged into chains that become individual strands of DNA, which is half of a full DNA molecule. Each strand has a sugar-phosphate backbone that is created when the phosphate of one nucleotide binds to the sugar of the next using a covalent phosphodiester bond. Specifically, the phosphate is found on the 5′ carbon of one nucleotide, while a hydroxyl group (-OH) is found on the 3′ carbon of the next nucleotide’s sugar group. The -OH of the 3′ carbon is removed, where the phosphate group on the 5′ carbon now also bonds to the 3′ carbon. Illustration showing how the phosphate group on the 5′ carbon forms a phosphodiester bond with the 3′ carbon of the next nucleotide. The nitrogenous bases stick out from this backbone. A second DNA strand is matched to this first strand based on complimentary base pairing, where a single purine pairs with a single pyrimidine. Specifically, adenine pairs with thymine and guanine pairs with cytosine. Hydrogen bonds connect the complimentary base pairs, where an adenine- thymine pair has two hydrogen bonds and a guanine-cytosine pair has three hydrogen bonds. A single DNA molecule results in formation when two DNA strands are matched and bonded. DNA has directionality that can run either 3′-5′ or 5′-3′ based off of the carbons in the sugar group. The two strands of DNA in the double helix must run opposite to each other in an anti-parallel fashion. Therefore, if the first strand starts at the 3′ end and finishes at the 5′ end, then the second strand must run opposite, starting at the 5′ end and finishing at the 3′ end. Example: 3′- AATCGTAA -5′ 5′- TTAGCATT -3′ DNA Replication Is Semiconservative DNA must be fully replicated before cells divide via mitosis to ensure all daughter cells have identical DNA. It was discovered that DNA replication is . In semiconservative replication, the double helix splits into two separate strands. During the replication process, an entirely new strand of DNA is created by using the original template strand and matching the complimentary bases. DNA Replication Process Graphic of the DNA double helix Proteins in DNA Replication DNA replication is highly regulated and requires multiple proteins to run efficiently. A majority of these proteins act as stabilizers and enzymes, with enzymes being proteins that behave as catalysts to create and speed up biochemical reactions. Some of the major proteins in DNA replication include the following: Helicase: An enzyme that opens the double helix by breaking the hydrogen bonds between complimentary base pairs Single-strand DNA- binding proteins (SSBPs): These proteins stabilize the individual strands of DNA to prevent them from reconnecting. Topoisomerase: Because unwinding of the DNA by helicase creates tension further down the strand, this enzyme relieves tension by making cuts in the DNA and rejoining them before the replication fork arrives. Primase: An enzyme that adds a primer (which is a short segment of ribonucleic acid, known as RNA) where DNA polymerase III will attach DNA polymerase III: An enzyme that creates the new DNA strand by adding nucleotides that are complimentary to the template strand DNA polymerase I: An enzyme that replaces the RNA primer with DNA DNA ligase: An enzyme that connects the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand by closing the sugar-phosphate backbone, creating a single DNA strand Sliding clamp: A protein that holds DNA polymerase III in place The Replication Bubble When DNA begins to replicate, a replication bubble is formed that can be detected visually by electron microscopy. A specific sequence of bases- known as the origin of replication– determines where this replication bubble begins. Inside of the bubble, two Y-shaped replication forks result where DNA is actively replicated on either side of the region. The replication forks are formed as the double strands of DNA are separated by helicase in both directions away from the origin of replication. It is at the replication fork that DNA replication proteins attach to fulfill their functions. Replicating the Leading Strand As mentioned previously, DNA strands have an anti-parallel nature, where one strand will run 3’-5’ and the other will run opposite from 5’- 3’. DNA polymerase can only synthesize new strands of DNA in the 5’-3’ direction. In order for DNA polymerase to do this, it must read the template strand from 3′-5′. Therefore, replicating the template strand that runs 3’-5’ results in the synthesis of the leading strand. The leading strand is a new strand of DNA that is synthesized in a single, continuous chain that starts at the 5’ end and finishes at the 3’ end. DNA polymerase reads the 3′-5′ template strand to synthesize the complimentary, leading strand from 5′-3′ DNA replication of the leading strand when the 3’-5’ template strand is used is as follows: The DNA double helix is opened by helicase into individual strands. Topoisomerase relieves the tension further down the double helix. SSBPs stabilize the single DNA strands to prevent them from reconnecting. An RNA primer is added to the leading strand at complimentary bases by primase. DNA polymerase III attaches to the primer. The sliding clamp stabilizes DNA polymerase III. DNA polymerase III moves down the leading strand towards the replication fork, adding bases to the new strand from the 5’ end to the 3’ end. Replicating the Lagging Strand DNA polymerase can only create new DNA strands from 5’-3’. Therefore, when the 5′-3′ template strand is being replicated- where the new strand must run opposite in the 3′-5′ direction- the new strand cannot be synthesized in a continuous fashion as the leading strand was. To overcome this challenge, additional steps are needed to replicate the 5′-3′ template strand, where this newly synthesized strand is known as the lagging strand. In order for the lagging strand to be synthesized, DNA needs to be broken down into smaller segments known as Okazaki fragments. Because of these multiple segments, the lagging strand is also known as the discontinuous strand. By creating these multiple segments, DNA polymerase III is able to synthesize a small portion of the new DNA strand away from the replication fork in the correct 5′-3′ direction. As the replication fork continues down the double helix in the 3′ direction of the template strand, another Okazaki fragment can be created closer to the fork. DNA polymerase III binds again to synthesize another portion of the new DNA strand away from the fork until it reaches the previous portion already synthesized. These fragments are then connected, resulting in a single DNA strand. This process continues down the entire length of the DNA. DNA replication of the leading vs. lagging strand showing multiple Okazaki fragments. DNA replication of the lagging strand when the 5’-3’ template strand is used is as follows: The DNA double helix is opened by helicase into individual strands. Topoisomerase relieves the tension further down the double helix. SSBPs stabilize the single DNA strands. Primase adds an RNA primer to the lagging strand. DNA polymerase III binds to the primer and creates a short segment of newly synthesized DNA from 5′-3′, synthesizing in the opposite direction of the replication fork. This is the first Okazaki fragment. As helicase further unwinds the double helix and the replication fork moves down the strand, another primer is added closer to the fork. DNA polymerase III attaches to this primer to synthesize a second Okazaki fragment in the 5′-3′ direction away from the replication fork. Once DNA polymerase III reaches the first Okazaki fragment primer, DNA polymerase I removes the primer and replaces them with the proper complementary bases. DNA ligase connects the segments of DNA by closing the sugar-phosphate backbone. The two segments are now connected into a single strand. This process repeats as the replication fork continues down the length of the DNA. Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes DNA replication overall is fairly conserved across life. However, general differences exist in the , as well as time required between species. The largest differences are between the domains of prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and eukaryotes (all other plant and animal cells). Minor differences between these groups include faster replication time in prokaryotes and shorter Okazaki fragments in eukaryotes. Additionally, prokaryotes only have a single origin of replication, while eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication. The most noteworthy difference between these groups however, is that prokaryotes have circular DNA while eukaryotes have linear DNA. Linear eukaryotic DNA creates an additional challenge that must be regulated. This brings us to telomeres. Telomeres Telomeres located at all four ends of a chromosome Because eukaryotic DNA is linear, they have ends that create a challenge. For the leading strand, DNA polymerase III can continue down the entire length of DNA. However, in the lagging strand, a primer must be added in front of the Okazaki fragment being synthesized before DNA polymerase III can attach and synthesize the new DNA strand opposite of the replication fork. Once the last Okazaki fragment is synthesized, a small DNA segment is leftover at the tip of the strand. This segment cannot be left unattended. If this DNA isn’t replicated, then genetic material will be lost each time replication occurs. After several replication cycles, this can result in lost information that could be critical for the individual to survive. To solve this issue, telomeres are present in eukaryotes. Telomeres are short, repeating segments of DNA that are found at the end of each chromosome and do not contain any coding sequences. These telomeres are synthesized by telomerase, which is an enzyme that contains a short RNA template used to extend the length of the lagging strand. Primers are placed on the telomere where DNA polymerase III can attach to synthesize the final portion of DNA leftover on the lagging strand. Telomerase using its embedded RNA template to extend the 3′ end of the lagging DNA strand Telomere replication on the lagging strand is as follows: Telomerase attaches to the very end of the lagging strand, overhanging the unreplicated portion of DNA. Using its own RNA template, telomerase synthesizes the extending telomere, adding additional bases to the 3’ end of the lagging strand. Primase adds the primer on the telomere. DNA polymerase III binds to the primer and moves opposite of telomerase to complete the synthesis of the lagging strand. Telomeres Affect Cell Age Telomerase is most commonly active in cell types that divide rapidly, such as with embryonic cells, stem cells, sperm cells, and immune cells. In most other cell types, telomerase activity is turned off, and telomeres become shorter with each DNA replication. This means that cells have a limited number of times that they are able to divide via mitosis before signals are sent to prevent further divisions and DNA damage. As a result, cells have age. Research has found that increasing telomere length can also increase the lifespan of the cell. While this offers a potential treatment to growth limiting cellular diseases, it also unfortunately assists cancer persistence and survival. Approximately 90% of cancer cells have mutated to turn on telomerase activity in cell types where it should be turned off. This causes another mechanism in which cancer cells can continue to divide without control and become immortalized. is ongoing to determine if/how deactivating telomerase activity can either slow or stop cancer progression. Difference of telomerase activity in normal cells vs. cancer cells DNA Repair and Damage Incorrect Replication DNA replication must be fast, but it must also be extremely accurate. DNA replication occurs trillions of times in a single human. Even if there was only a single mistake in each replication, that would add up to trillions of errors that could be detrimental to the individual’s life. So how are mistakes regulated? The first way this is done is by DNA polymerase proofreading its own work. Each complimentary pair of nucleotides has a distinct shape. Therefore, when the wrong base is placed, the shape is different enough that DNA polymerase can recognize its own mistake. DNA polymerase can then cut out this wrong match and replace it with the correct base. Proteins repairing DNA segments While DNA polymerase is able to proofread its own work, sometimes mistakes still goes amiss. Once DNA polymerase continues down the length of the strand, mismatch repair proteins are able to edit any additional mistakes. By using markers on the old strand of DNA, the mismatch repair proteins can distinguish sequence errors on the new strand. They then remove the mismatched nucleotide and replace it accordingly. With both DNA polymerase proofreading and the mismatch repair proteins correcting additional mistakes, there is roughly only one mistake for every 1 billion nucleotides synthesized. Environmental Damage Environmental factors- such a UV radiation, X-rays, and chemical exposure- can damage DNA. For example, UV radiation found in sunlight and tanning booths can create a thymine dimer where two thymine bases next to each other form a covalent bond. This thus creates a bump in the DNA strand that prevents DNA polymerase from synthesizing past this point. These circumstances can become detrimental, and must be put into place to repair damages such as this. In the case of the UV radiation, eukaryotic cells have adapted a nucleotide excision repair system that is able to detect deformities in the shape of the DNA helix. At least 18 different proteins work together to remove this deformity, using the non-damaged strand as a template to repair the damaged strand. Prokaryotic cells have a simpler but similar nucleotide excision repair system that only requires three proteins. However, for UV radiation specifically, prokaryotes use an enzyme known as photolyase to detect this damage and make repairs.

By using iodine 3′-deoxyuridine/chlorodeoxyuridine double labelling, we found that all micronuclei containing lamin B are replicated during one cell cycle, whereas micronuclei lacking lamin B are never replicated. This result suggests that the content of lamin B-negative micronuclei is lost during cell division. Furthermore, we simultaneously visualised sites of DNA synthesis, lamin B and the extrachromosomal double minutes chromatin, which contain amplified oncogenes. We found that although the replication timing of double minutes was generally preserved in micronuclei, at times it differed greatly from the timing in the nucleus, which may perturb the expression of the amplified oncogenes. Taken together, these findings uncovered the DNA replication occurring inside micronuclei. Introduction The micronucleus is a small nucleus-like structure that forms within cytoplasm, separately from the main nucleus (,). It can be detected in almost all growing mammalian cells in response to a wide variety of stimuli that cause genome damage. Therefore, the presence of micronuclei is widely used as a hallmark of genotoxic stress. Micronuclei are generated by several different mechanisms. They can be generated post-mitotically from the lagging chromatid, and such ‘chromatin laggards’ can be derived from (i) an acentric chromosome fragment generated by drugs or radiation that induce DNA breaks, (ii) a whole chromosome that was not bound to or merotelically bound to the spindle microtubule or (iii) a broken chromatin bridge connecting the separating anaphase chromosome. Furthermore, micronuclei can be generated from aggregates of extrachromosomal elements such as double minutes (DMs) chromatin bodies, which is a cytogenetic manifestation of gene amplification (). This type of micronuclei is referred to as DM-type, while the other micronuclei are known as chromosome type (). In addition to post-mitotic generation, micronuclei are also formed during interphase by nuclear budding (). The nuclear buds may form through the lamina break, which is coupled to cytoplasmic membrane blebbing (Koh-ichi Utani, Atsushi Okamoto and Noriaki Shimizu, submitted for publication). On the other hand, there are micronuclei that lack the lamin B protein, a constituent of nuclear lamina, as well as others that contain lamin B. It has been suggested that micronuclei lacking lamin B are generated by broken chromatin bridges () and/or by nuclear budding through the lamina break (Koh-ichi Utani, Atsushi Okamoto and Noriaki Shimizu, submitted for publication).It is commonly hypothesised that the content of micronuclei is ultimately eliminated from cells, though the mechanism of how this occurs remains unknown. The micronuclei may be degraded in situ in cytoplasm (). Alternatively, they may be extruded out of cells since extracellular micronuclei have been detected in culture fluid (). Another possibility is that no DNA replication occurs in micronuclei, leading to the dilution of the unreplicated micronuclei DNA during cell division. However, previous studies using short-term bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse labelling revealed that at least a portion of micronuclei underwent DNA synthesis, though there were also micronuclei that did not incorporate BrdU (,,). Since DNA replication inside micronuclei has not been well studied (reviewed in ref. ), we used several modern in situ techniques to examine this process more extensively. Materials and methods Cell and cell culture Human colorectal tumour COLO 320DM (CCL 220) cells () and human cervical tumour HeLa cells () were obtained and maintained as described previously. For the experiments shown in , HeLa cells at the mitotic phase were collected by the mitotic shake-off. The cells were cultured for 14 h in normal conditions and then chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) and cytochalasin B (4 μg/ml; Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) were added to the culture. Cytochemical procedure BrdU (Sigma), iodine 3′-deoxyuridine (IdU) (Sigma) or CldU (ICN pharmaceuticals, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) is a halogenated thymidine analogue, and it was used to label the sites of DNA synthesis. Indirect immunofluorescence detection of BrdU or the simultaneous detection of IdU and CldU was performed using antibodies and the protocols described in our previous paper (). The incorporated CldU was detected with a monoclonal rat anti-BrdU antibody (6 μg/ml; OBT0030; Oxford Biotechnology), and IdU was detected with a monoclonal mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1.5 μg/ml, cat. no. 347580; Becton Dickinson). The former antibody binds to both BrdU and CldU but not to IdU, while the latter antibody strongly binds to both BrdU and IdU and weakly to CldU. Therefore, samples were first incubated with the rat anti-BrdU antibody for 1 h at 37°C to detect CldU and then incubated with the mouse anti-BrdU antibody for 1 h at 37°C to detect IdU. These primary antibodies were detected by Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Co.) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG (Invitrogen, Co.).In the experiment shown in and , DNA synthesis was detected by EdU (5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine) labelling. Because fluorescent detection of EdU employs only a chemical reaction, it enabled the simultaneous detection of lamin B by immunofluorescence and of DMs by fluorescence in situ hybridization, both of which require multiple antibody reactions. Labelling and detection of EdU was performed as described previously (). In short, EdU (Invitrogen) was added to the culture to a final concentration of 10 μM and incubated for the indicated times. After labelling EdU, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature. Then, the cells were cytocentrifuged onto poly L-lysine-coated slides. The slides were reacted with 1 mM CuSO4, 100 mM ascorbic acid and 10 μM Alexa Fluor 647 azide (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature and were washed with PBS. Denaturation of DNA, hybridisation with DIG-labelled probe prepared from c-myc cosmid DNA, and simultaneous detection of the hybridised probe and the lamin B protein was performed using the same procedure as described previously ().Immunofluorescent detection of lamin B protein used 5 μg/ml Goat anti Lamin B (M-20; Santa Crutz Biotechnology, Inc.) and 10 μg/ml Texas red-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (EY Laboratories). Microscopy The images appearing in and were obtained with an Olympus FV10-ASW confocal system on FV1000D-IX81 with a ×60 objective (UPLSAPO NA 1.35, oil). The images appearing in were obtained with a Nikon inverted microscope (TE2000-E; Nikon, Tokyo) with a ×60 objective (Nikon, Tokyo, Plan Apo VC 1.40, oil). All images were processed and assembled using Adobe Photoshop CS version 8.0.1 (Adobe Systems Inc.). Fig. 1BrdU pulse labelling revealed that DNA replication occurs in micronuclei. HeLa cells (A–G) or COLO 320DM cells (H) were pulse treated with 100 μM BrdU for 2 h and then harvested and fixed with PFA. The location of BrdU incorporation and the lamin B protein was visualised simultaneously, and confocal images were obtained (A–F). Micronuclei were classified according to lamin B status and BrdU incorporation. After examination of 149 (HeLa) or 115 (COLO 320DM) micronuclei, each type of micronuclei were quantified and plotted in G and H. Fig. 2DNA replication occurs in all lamin B-positive micronuclei but not in lamin B-negative micronuclei. (A) Outline of the experimental procedure. Logarithmically growing COLO 320DM or cell cycle-synchronised HeLa cells were cultured in the presence of 30 μM CldU and 4 μg/ml cytochalasin B for 12 h. Then, 100 μM IdU was added during the last 20 min. The cells were harvested and fixed with PFA. Incorporated CldU and IdU as well as lamin B protein were simultaneously detected, and DNA was counterstained by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The representative images are shown in B–G. Mononucleated cells that were CldU-labelled, but not IdU-labelled (D–F), were designated as G2 phase cells. The COLO 320DM and the HeLa culture contained 5.5 and 32.5% G2 phase cells, respectively. The number of micronuclei in G2 phase cells, as classified by the presence or absence of CldU signal and lamin B within micronuclei, were plotted (H and I). Fig. 3Simultaneous imaging of DNA replication sites, lamin B and DMs revealed the timing of replication in DM-type and chromosome-type micronuclei. Logarithmically growing COLO 320DM cells were treated with EdU for 2 h and fixed with PFA. The incorporated EdU, lamin B and DMs were simultaneously detected by different fluorescent colours, and DNA was counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). The representative images are shown in A–E. COLO 320DM (F) or HeLa (G) cells were cultured in the presence of 4 μg/ml of cytochalasin B for 24 h. The cells were treated with 100 μM BrdU for 30 min and then fixed with PFA. BrdU was detected as in above and counterstained with DAPI. The binucleated cells showing differential replication timing are shown. Results and discussion BrdU pulse labelling revealed that DNA replication occurs in lamin B-positive micronuclei About 5% of logarithmically growing cultures of cells (HeLa or COLO 320DM) contained micronuclei. We treated these cultures with BrdU for 2 h to label the DNA replication sites, fixed the cells and visualised the BrdU-labelled DNA and the nuclear lamin B protein simultaneously. Representative images of HeLa cells are shown in . We observed both lamin B-positive and negative micronuclei. Presence of both type was reported for chromosome-type (,) or DM-type micronuclei (,). While we were able to detect DNA replication in some lamin B-positive micronuclei (), we did not detect it in another portion of lamin B-positive micronuclei () nor in any lamin B-negative micronuclei (), despite the fact that DNA replication occurred within the main nucleus. To address whether this was due to cells being in different cell cycle stages, we classified the cells into early, middle and late S phase as well as G1/G2 phase according to the nuclear distribution pattern of BrdU labelling (). DNA replication takes place at the inner euchromatin during early S phase (), at the peri-nuclear and the peri-nucleolar heterochromatin during middle S phase () and at the internal large heterochromatin during late S phase (not shown in and see ). We counted micronuclei with/without lamin B and with/without BrdU labelling at each cell cycle stage () and found that no lamin B-negative micronuclei displayed a BrdU signal at any point within the cell cycle. On the other hand, we were able to detect DNA replication in lamin B-positive micronuclei, most frequently during early S phase. However, even during early S, the BrdU signal was detected in only a portion of the lamin B-positive micronuclei. There are two possible explanations for this observation (i) DNA replication is permitted in only a portion of lamin B-positive micronuclei or (ii) DNA replication is permitted in all lamin B-positive micronuclei, but the limited BrdU labelling time (2 h) may prevent all lamin B-positive micronuclei from being labelled since S phase typically spans 10 h. We found that the number of BrdU-positive micronuclei increased when the BrdU labelling time increased (data not shown). However, labelling the cells with BrdU for an entire cell cycle (≥24 h) resulted in the delay of cell cycle progression, perhaps due to the cytotoxic effect of BrdU. Furthermore, continuous BrdU labelling induced DNA damage in the labelled chromatin, which generated BrdU-positive micronuclei after mitosis that hindered analysis. To overcome this technical obstacle, we used a double labelling technique in the following section. DNA replication occurs in all lamin B-positive micronuclei but not in lamin B-negative micronuclei To determine whether every micronucleus is replicated during S phase (∼10 h), we performed a double pulse-chase experiment using IdU and CldU, instead of a single BrdU pulse labelling. Namely, we cultured logarithmically growing COLO 320DM cells in the presence of CldU and cytochalasin B for 12 h, added IdU during the last 20 min of culture () and then harvested the cells. We fixed the cells with PFA and detected the incorporated CldU, IdU and lamin B protein simultaneously by using specific antibodies. CldU or IdU, as BrdU, was a halogenated thymidine analogue that label the site of DNA replication. Its labelling pattern among the nucleus correlates to the position in the S phase, as shown above for BrdU-labelling. When cells in late S phase were harvested, the IdU label showed a late S phase pattern and the CldU labelling represented DNA in the main nucleus that was replicated during the 12 h prior to harvest (). If the cells passed through mitosis, they appeared as binucleated cells since cytochalasin B inhibited cytokinesis (). Therefore, G2 phase cells were identified as cells containing a CldU signal in the absence of an IdU signal. The representative image shown in shows that a CldU signal was detected in the lamin B-positive micronucleus. Out of the 85 lamin B-positive micronuclei (), 84 were labelled with CldU, while only one was not (). It is possible that S phase progression was partly delayed in that the cell lacking a CldU signal and thus required >12 h of CldU labelling. Apart from this exception, we concluded that all lamin B-positive micronuclei are replicated during S phase. By contrast, lamin B-negative micronuclei in G2 phase were not labelled with CldU (), suggesting that DNA replication does not occur in lamin B-negative micronuclei. Similar results were obtained for cell cycle-synchronised HeLa cells (). DNA replication timing of DM-type and chromosome-type micronuclei During the above experiment, we noticed that some micronuclei actively incorporated IdU despite the fact that its neighbouring nucleus had already completed DNA synthesis (). Therefore, we examined the replication timing of not only the usual chromosome-type micronuclei but also DM-type micronuclei in COLO 320DM cells. DMs are extrachromosomal, transcriptionally active euchromatin (,) that are replicated during early S phase within the nucleus (). To detect DMs, lamin B and the DNA replication sites simultaneously, we labelled DNA replication sites with EdU. We used EdU instead of halogenated thymidine analogue, because detection of EdU required only chemical reaction, and it enabled the simultaneous detection of lamin B and DMs. The representative images are shown in , and all the images contain lamin B-positive DM-type micronuclei. In , DNA replication was detected in the micronucleus when the nucleus was at early S phase (A) or middle S phase (B). As shown in , DNA replication was not detected in the micronucleus, when the nucleus was in late S phase. Strikingly, there were other micronuclei that replicated while the nucleus was in late S phase () and in G1/G2 (no nuclear EdU-labelling; ). These events were quantified, and the frequencies were plotted in . The micronuclei containing EdU signals were most frequently associated with nuclei in early or middle S phase. Because DMs are early replicating euchromatin in the nucleus (), the results suggest that the timing of replication in the nucleus was similar to the one in the micronuclei. However, a portion of DM-type micronuclei replicated while the nucleus was in late S to G1/G2 phase (), consistent with , suggesting that the replication timing of some DMs is not synchronised with nuclear replication. On the other hand, the replication timing of the chromosome-type micronuclei appeared to be distributed more randomly because approximately half of the micronuclei replicated at each time point examined (). Fig. 4DNA replication timing was conserved in micronuclei, but at times differed significantly from the timing in the nucleus. Slides prepared similarly to slides from were examined. The cell cycle stage of the nucleus was estimated by the EdU labelling pattern. Of the cells in the culture, 5.5% contained micronuclei. A total of 109 micronuclei with DMs (A; DM type) and 114 micronuclei without DMs (B; chromosome type) were classified according to the presence or absence of lamin and EdU signal within micronuclei. Differentiation of replication timing between the micronucleus and the nucleus As described above, we demonstrated that the timing of micronuclei replication differed from that of nuclear replication, despite being within the same cytoplasm. Interestingly, we also found that the timing of DNA"

0,ndsu,DNA Replication Controls: Volume 1,https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/~mcclean/plsc431/eukarychrom/eukaryo2.htm,"DNA replication has two requirements that must be met: DNA template Free 3' -OH group Proteins of DNA Replication DNA exists in the nucleus as a condensed, compact structure. To prepare DNA for replication, a series of proteins aid in the unwinding and separation of the double-stranded DNA molecule. These proteins are required because DNA must be single-stranded before replication can proceed. DNA Helicases - These proteins bind to the double stranded DNA and stimulate the separation of the two strands. DNA single-stranded binding proteins - These proteins bind to the DNA as a tetramer and stabilize the single-stranded structure that is generated by the action of the helicases. Replication is 100 times faster when these proteins are attached to the single-stranded DNA. DNA Gyrase - This enzyme catalyzes the formation of negative supercoils that is thought to aid with the unwinding process. In addition to these proteins, several other enzymes are involved in bacterial DNA replication. DNA Polymerase - DNA Polymerase I (Pol I) was the first enzyme discovered with polymerase activity, and it is the best characterized enzyme. Although this was the first enzyme to be discovered that had the required polymerase activities, it is not the primary enzyme involved with bacterial DNA replication. That enzyme is DNA Polymerase III (Pol III). Three activities are associated with DNA polymerase I; 5' to 3' elongation (polymerase activity) 3' to 5' exonuclease (proof-reading activity) 5' to 3' exonuclease (repair activity) The second two activities of DNA Pol I are important for replication, but DNA Polymerase III (Pol III) is the enzyme that performs the 5'-3' polymerase function. Primase - The requirement for a free 3' hydroxyl group is fulfilled by the RNA primers that are synthesized at the initiation sites by these enzymes. DNA Ligase - Nicks occur in the developing molecule because the RNA primer is removed and synthesis proceeds in a discontinuous manner on the lagging strand. The final replication product does not have any nicks because DNA ligase forms a covalent phosphodiester linkage between 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate groups. A General Model for DNA Replication The DNA molecule is unwound and prepared for synthesis by the action of DNA gyrase, DNA helicase and the single-stranded DNA binding proteins. A free 3'OH group is required for replication, but when the two chains separate no group of that nature exists. RNA primers are synthesized, and the free 3'OH of the primer is used to begin replication. The replication fork moves in one direction, but DNA replication only goes in the 5' to 3' direction. This paradox is resolved by the use of Okazaki fragments. These are short, discontinuous replication products that are produced off the lagging strand. This is in comparison to the continuous strand that is made off the leading strand. The final product does not have RNA stretches in it. These are removed by the 5' to 3' exonuclease action of Polymerase I. 5. The final product does not have any gaps in the DNA that result from the removal of the RNA primer. These are filled in by the action of DNA Polymerase I. 6. DNA polymerase does not have the ability to form the final bond. This is done by the enzyme DNA"

DNA replication is part of a cell’s life cycle. When your cells divide they need to create an exact copy of their genetic material for the new cell. The specific steps for DNA replication are included in the DNA itself. To do this duplication, your cells rely on the nucleotides that make up your DNA molecule, along with some helper molecules like DNA polymerase and DNA helicase. Nucleotides in your DNA are composed of: A phosphate group A five-carbon sugar One of four nitrogenous bases—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—often shortened to A, T, C, and G The DNA replication process starts with the DNA in its double-stranded form—pairs of nucleotides bound together forming a twisted ladder-like structure called a double helix. How Does DNA Replication Work? The replication process is initiated when the bonds between the nucleotide base pairs of the double helix are broken by a DNA helicase. This allows the double-stranded DNA structure to unwind and unzip, forming a little pocket where the are separated. This pocket is called a replication fork, with each of the fork’s two separated DNA strands serving as a template for the replication process. One strand is called the leading strand and the other one is referred to as the lagging strand. The duplication process then moves forward with the help of an enzyme called DNA polymerase. DNA polymerase bonds each nucleotide base to a new partner—A with T, and C with G—to synthesize a new strand of DNA. This specific bonding pattern of the base pairs results in two copies of the DNA molecule being created from the original version. How Are Replication Errors and Mutations Prevented? While each nucleotide has a specific binding pattern to form nucleotide pairs, on occasion, DNA polymerase will accidentally match the wrong ones together, add too many nucleotides, or miss adding a nucleotide. For example, it could bond an A with a C instead of a T. This is a problem, as these kinds of errors can result in a . This mutation could impact the maintenance and repair of your cell’s life cycle. It might also be passed down to the next generation. To avoid this, DNA polymerase “proofreads” and stops replicating if it detects an error. Once other molecules fix the mistake, DNA polymerase can resume and continue until the DNA replication process is complete. This proofreading activity is so effective that, on average, only one mutation occurs for every 100 million bases. Why Does DNA Replicate? DNA replication plays an important role in the growth and renewal of cells. Growing organisms are constantly creating new cells as they develop into a larger body. These new cells need accurate copies of DNA to do their job. Additionally, over time, some cells can become damaged, grow old, or die. To keep your body functioning properly, it's important that these cells are quickly replaced with new ones that carry the genetic instructions to do their work. Cells accomplish this renewal and growth through the process of cell division, in which one cell splits in half to form two new cells. In order for a cell to divide, it must first make a copy of its entire , which is all of the DNA it needs to function properly. It is very important that your DNA is replicated accurately, with new cells receiving an exact copy of your genetic sequence. How Was the DNA Replication Process Discovered? For many years, scientists were unsure how a cell replicated or synthesized its DNA. Three competing theories were proposed. The conservative model posited that the original DNA double helix remained completely intact. The new copy did not borrow any molecules from the original. The semiconservative model suggested that DNA unwound during replication, with each strand serving as a template for synthesis of a new DNA strand. In the dispersive model, the original double helix was believed to be broken into many small pieces, with some of these pieces ending up within each new strand. The debate was finally resolved in 1958 by two scientists named Matthew Meselson and Franklin Stahl. In a now-famous biology experiment, they grew bacteria inside a special solution to label all of the cells' DNA with a marker. They then used a different marker to label only the DNA that was newly synthesized. They discovered that replicated DNA always contained one strand from the original DNA molecule and one strand that was newly formed. This proved that the semiconservative model of DNA replication was correct. Reference Meselson, Matthew and Franklin W. Stahl. ""The Replication of DNA in Escherichia Coli.""

MRI machines work thanks to the quantum property of , which provides each atom with a predictable magnetic property. By exciting these magnets with radio-frequency light, we can make 3D maps of objects from the outside. Modern medical MRIs have high enough resolution to image individual hairs. Physicists are developing a new MRI technique using defects in diamond as quantum processors that is thousands of times more precise — almost down to the size of an atom.

Share this This article was reviewed by a member of Caltech's Faculty. Quantum physics is the study of matter and energy at the most fundamental level. It aims to uncover the properties and behaviors of the very building blocks of nature. While many quantum experiments examine very small objects, such as electrons and photons, quantum phenomena are all around us, acting on every scale. However, we may not be able to detect them easily in larger objects. This may give the wrong impression that quantum phenomena are bizarre or otherworldly. In fact, quantum science closes gaps in our knowledge of physics to give us a more complete picture of our everyday lives.Quantum discoveries have been incorporated into our foundational understanding of materials, chemistry, biology, and astronomy. These discoveries are a valuable resource for innovation, such as lasers and transistors, and enabling real progress on technologies once considered purely speculative, such as . Physicists are exploring the potential of quantum science to transform our view of gravity and its connection to space and time. Quantum science may even reveal how everything in the universe (or in multiple universes) is connected to everything else through higher dimensions that our senses cannot comprehend. The Origins of Quantum PhysicsThe field of quantum physics arose in the late 1800s and early 1900s from a series of experimental observations of atoms that didn't make intuitive sense in the context of classical physics. Among the basic discoveries was the realization that matter and energy can be thought of as discrete packets, or quanta, that have a minimum value associated with them. For example, light of a fixed frequency will deliver energy in quanta called ""photons."" Each photon at this frequency will have the same amount of energy, and this energy can't be broken down into smaller units. In fact, the word ""quantum"" has Latin roots and means ""how much.""Knowledge of quantum principles transformed our conceptualization of the atom, which consists of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. Early models depicted electrons as particles that orbited the nucleus, much like the way satellites orbit Earth. Modern quantum physics instead understands electrons as being distributed within orbitals, mathematical descriptions that represent the probability of the electrons' existence in more than one location within a given range at any given time. Electrons can jump from one orbital to another as they gain or lose energy, but they cannot be found between orbitals.Other central concepts helped to establish the foundations of quantum physics:Wave-particle duality: This principle dates back to the earliest days of quantum science. It describes the outcomes of experiments that showed that light and matter had the properties of particles or waves, depending on how they were measured. Today, we understand that these different forms of energy are actually neither particle nor wave. They are distinct quantum objects that we cannot easily conceptualize.: This is a term used to describe an object as a combination of multiple possible states at the same time. A superposed object is analogous to a ripple on the surface of a pond that is a combination of two waves overlapping. In a mathematical sense, an object in superposition can be represented by an equation that has more than one solution or outcome.: This is a mathematical concept that represents a trade-off between complementary points of view. In physics, this means that two properties of an object, such as its position and velocity, cannot both be precisely known at the same time. If we precisely measure the position of an electron, for example, we will be limited in how precisely we can know its speed.: This is a phenomenon that occurs when two or more objects are connected in such a way that they can be thought of as a single system, even if they are very far apart. The state of one object in that system can't be fully described without information on the state of the other object. Likewise, learning information about one object automatically tells you something about the other and vice versa. Mathematics and the Probabilistic Nature of Quantum ObjectsBecause many of the concepts of quantum physics are difficult if not impossible for us to visualize, mathematics is essential to the field. Equations are used to describe or help predict quantum objects and phenomena in ways that are more exact than what our imaginations can conjure.Mathematics is also necessary to represent the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena. For example, the position of an electron may not be known exactly. Instead, it may be described as being in a range of possible locations (such as within an orbital), with each location associated with a probability of finding the electron there.Given their probabilistic nature, quantum objects are often described using mathematical ""wave functions,"" which are solutions to what is known as the . Waves in water can be characterized by the changing height of the water as the wave moves past a set point. Similarly, sound waves can be characterized by the changing compression or expansion of air molecules as they move past a point. Wave functions don't track with a physical property in this way. The solutions to the wave functions provide the likelihoods of where an observer might find a particular object over a range of potential options. However, just as a ripple in a pond or a note played on a trumpet are spread out and not confined to one location, quantum objects can also be in multiple places—and take on different states, as in the case of superposition—at once. Observation of Quantum ObjectsThe act of observation is a topic of considerable discussion in quantum physics. Early in the field, scientists were baffled to find that simply observing an experiment influenced the outcome. For example, an electron acted like a wave when not observed, but the act of observing it caused the wave to collapse (or, more accurately, ""decohere"") and the electron to behave instead like a particle. Scientists now appreciate that the term ""observation"" is misleading in this context, suggesting that consciousness is involved. Instead, ""measurement"" better describes the effect, in which a change in outcome may be caused by the interaction between the quantum phenomenon and the external environment, including the device used to measure the phenomenon. Even this connection has caveats, though, and a full understanding of the relationship between measurement and outcome is still needed.

This experiment, which involves shooting particles such as photons or electrons though a barrier with two slits, was originally used in 1801 to show that light is made up of waves. Since then, numerous incarnations of the experiment have been used to demonstrate that matter can also behave like a wave and to demonstrate the principles of superposition, entanglement, and the observer effect.The field of quantum science may seem mysterious or illogical, but it describes everything around us, whether we realize it or not.

Smartphone navigation is enabled by the Global Positioning System, a network of satellites each broadcasting the time. The GPS receiver in your phone picks up the signal from multiple clocks, and uses the different arrival times from different satellites to determine your distance from each of those satellites. The computer inside the receiver then does a bit of math to figure out the single point on the surface of the Earth that is that distance from those satellites, and locates you to within a few meters. This trilateration relies on the constant speed of light to convert time to distance. Light moves at about a foot per nanosecond, so the timing accuracy of the satellite signals needs to be really good, so each satellite in the GPS constellation contains an ensemble of atomic clocks.

We might talk about Einstein or Schrödinger. What else? The conversation involving Quantum Physics might end at the above-mentioned point. If someone were to ask us the daily life or real-life examples of Quantum Physics, most of us would be totally unaware of it. Once you get to know about the real-life applications of Quantum Physics, you might wonder that the examples of the same were right in front of you! Let’s begin this article and take a closer at a number of things which depend upon Quantum Physics for their operation. 1. Toaster The bread toast which you enjoy while sipping on your morning tea is able to make its way to your plate only because of Quantum Physics. The heating element of the toaster glows red to toast a slice of bread. Toasters are generally referred to as the reason why Quantum Physics came into existence. The rod in the toaster gets hot, which, in turn, is responsible for toasting the bread. 2. Fluorescent Light The light which you are getting from the tubes or those curly bulbs is a result of a quantum phenomenon only. In fluorescent lighting, a small amount of mercury vapour is excited into the plasma. Mercury has the ability to emit light in the visible range. So, the next time you switch on the lights of your room at night, make sure you thank Quantum Physics. 3. Computer & Mobile Phone The whole computer world is based on the principle of Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics talks about the wave nature of electrons, and, so, this forms the basis of the band structure of solid objects on which semiconductor-based electronics are built. Not to forget that we are able to manipulate the electrical properties of silicon only because we can study the wave nature of electrons. Once the band structure is changed, the conductivity alters as well. How can the band structure be changed? Of course, Quantum Physics knows the answer! 4. Biological Compass If you think that only the humankind has been lucky enough to make use of Quantum Physics, you are totally wrong! According to theories by scientists, birds like European Robin make use of Quantum Physics to migrate. A light-sensitive protein called cryptochrome contains electrons. Photons, after entering the eyes of the bird, hit cryptochrome, and radicals are released. These radicals enable the bird to “see” a magnetic map. Another theory suggests that the beaks of the birds contain magnetic minerals. Crustaceans, lizards, insects, and even some mammals make use of such type of magnetic compass. You might be surprised to know the type of cryptochrome which is used for navigation by flies has also been found in the human eye! However, its use is unclear. 5. Transistor Transistors have widespread uses and are used to amplify or switch electrical signals and electrical power. Looking closely at the structure of transistors, we would realize that a transistor consists of layers of silicon associated with other elements. Computer chips are made by millions of these, and these computer chips form the powerhouse of all the technological gadgets which have become central to human existence. Had Quantum Physics not come into play, these chips would not have been created and neither would desktops, tablets, laptops, smartphones, and other gadgets have found their way into human life. 6. Laser The principle on which laser works is based on Quantum Physics. The working of lasers involves spontaneous emission, thermal emission, and fluorescence. An electron, when excited, will jump to a high-energy level. However, it will not stay in the high-energy level for a long time, and jump back to the lower energy state which is more stable; and, thereby, emit light. The quantum mechanical state of the atom is also affected by external photons which are at a frequency associated with the atomic transition. 7. Microscopy Electron microscopy has improved with underlying principles of Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics in association and electron microscopy have improved the imaging of biological samples. Moreover, in differential interference contrast microscopy, a pattern of interference is created by the beam of photons, which is then analysed. All-in-one, with Quantum Physics, microscopy has improved to a great extent, and, therefore, a large amount of information from a sample can be obtained. 8. Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigating to unknown locations has never been easier as it has been with the aid of Quantum Physics. While using a mobile phone for navigation, the GPS receiver in the phone is responsible for picking up the signal from multiple clocks. The distance and time between your current location and the destination are calculated by calculating different arrival times from different satellites. Moreover, even the distance from your current location from each satellite is also calculated. Each satellite is equipped with an atomic clock, which relies on Quantum Physics only. 9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging, also known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, involves the reversal of the spins of the electrons in hydrogen nuclei. So, basically, we are talking of shift in energies; which is nothing but one of the applications of Quantum Physics. The study of soft tissues can easily be carried out with the use of MRI. Thanks to Quantum Physics that the diagnosis and treatment of some life-threatening ailments have been possible. 10. Telecommunication Communication has been made extremely easy because of the important role of Quantum Physics. Fibre optic telecommunication has made possible two-way and quick communication. The fibre optic telecommunication is possible only because of lasers, which are devices of Quantum Physics.

Science Photo Library/Corbis Quantum mechanics is weird. The theory, which describes the workings of tiny particles and forces, notoriously made Albert Einstein so uneasy that in 1935 that it must be incomplete—it was too “spooky” to be real. The trouble is that quantum physics seems to defy the common-sense notions of causality, locality and realism. For example, you know that the moon exists even when you’re not looking at it—that's realism. Causality tells us that if you flick a light switch, the bulb will illuminate. And thanks to a hard limit on the speed of light, if you flick a switch now, the related effect could not occur instantly a million light-years away according to locality. However, these principles break down in the quantum realm. Perhaps the most famous example is quantum entanglement, which says that particles on opposite sides of the universe can be intrinsically linked so that they share information instantly—an idea that made Einstein scoff. But in 1964, physicist John Stewart Bell proved that quantum physics was in fact a complete and workable theory. His results, now called , effectively proved that quantum properties like entanglement are as real as the moon, and today the bizarre behaviors of quantum systems are being harnessed for use in a variety of real-world applications. Here are five of the most intriguing: A strontium clock, unveiled by NIST and JILA in January, will keep accurate time for the next 5 billion years. The Ye group and Brad Baxley, JILA Ultra-Precise Clocks Reliable timekeeping is about more than just your morning alarm. Clocks synchronize our technological world, keeping things like stock markets and GPS systems in line. Standard clocks use the regular oscillations of physical objects like pendulums or quartz crystals to produce their ‘ticks’ and ‘tocks’. Today, the most precise clocks in the world, , are able to use principles of quantum theory to measure time. They monitor the specific radiation frequency needed to make electrons jump between energy levels. The at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Colorado only loses or gains a second every 3.7 billion years. And the NIST strontium clock, , will be that accurate for 5 billion years—longer than the current age of the Earth. Such super-sensitive atomic clocks help with GPS navigation, telecommunications and surveying. The precision of atomic clocks relies partially on the number of atoms used. Kept in a vacuum chamber, each atom independently measures time and keeps an eye on the random local differences between itself and its neighbors. If scientists cram 100 times more atoms into an atomic clock, it becomes 10 times more precise—but there is a limit on how many atoms you can squeeze in. Researchers’ next big goal is to successfully use entanglement to enhance precision. Entangled atoms would not be preoccupied with local differences and would instead solely measure the passage of time, effectively bringing them together as a single pendulum. That means adding 100 times more atoms into an entangled clock would make it 100 times more precise. Entangled clocks could even be linked to form a that would measure time independent of location. Observers will have a tough time hacking into quantum correspondence. VOLKER STEGER/Science Photo Library/Corbis Uncrackable Codes Traditional cryptography works using keys: A sender uses one key to encode information, and a recipient uses another to decode the message. However, it’s difficult to remove the risk of an eavesdropper, and keys can be compromised. This can be fixed using potentially unbreakable quantum key distribution (QKD). In QKD, information about the key is sent via photons that have been randomly polarized. This restricts the photon so that it vibrates in only one plane—for example, up and down, or left to right. The recipient can use polarized filters to decipher the key and then use a chosen algorithm to securely encrypt a message. The secret data still gets sent over normal communication channels, but no one can decode the message unless they have the exact quantum key. That's tricky, because quantum rules dictate that ""reading"" the polarized photons will always change their states, and any attempt at eavesdropping will alert the communicators to a security breach. Today companies such as , and use QKD to design ultra-secure networks. In 2007 Switzerland tried out an ID Quantique product to provide a during an election. And the went ahead in Austria in 2004. This system promises to be highly secure, because if the photons are entangled, any changes to their quantum states made by interlopers would be immediately apparent to anyone monitoring the key-bearing particles. But this system doesn't yet work over large distances. So far, entangled photons have been transmitted over a . Closeup of a D-Wave One computer chip. D-Wave Systems, Inc. Super-Powerful Computers A standard computer encodes information as a string of binary digits, or bits. supercharge processing power because they use quantum bits, or qubits, which exist in a superposition of states—until they are measured, qubits can be both ""1"" and ""0"" at the same time. This field is still in development, but there have been steps in the right direction. In 2011, D-Wave Systems revealed the D-Wave One, a 128-qubit processor, followed a year later by the 512-qubit D-Wave Two. The company says these are the world's first commercially available quantum computers. However, this claim has been met with skepticism, in part because it’s still unclear whether D-Wave’s qubits are entangled. Studies released in May found but only in a small subset of the computer’s qubits. There's also uncertainty over whether the chips display any reliable . Still, NASA and Google have teamed up to form the based on a D-Wave Two. And scientists at the University of Bristol last year to the Internet so anyone with a web browser can learn quantum coding. Keeping a sharp eye on entanglement. Ono et al., arxiv.org Improved Microscopes In February a team of researchers at Japan’s Hokkaido University developed the world’s first , using a technique known as differential interference contrast microscopy. This type of microscope fires two beams of photons at a substance and measures the interference pattern created by the reflected beams—the pattern changes depending on whether they hit a flat or uneven surface. Using entangled photons greatly increases the amount of information the microscope can gather, as measuring one entangled photon gives information about its partner. The Hokkaido team managed to image an engraved ""Q"" that stood just 17 nanometers above the background with unprecedented sharpness. Similar techniques could be used to improve the resolution of astronomy tools called interferometers, which superimpose different waves of light to better analyze their properties. Interferometers are used in the hunt for extrasolar planets, to probe nearby stars and to search for ripples in spacetime called . The European robin may be a quantum natural. Andrew Parkinson/Corbis Biological Compasses Humans aren't the only ones making use of quantum mechanics. One leading theory suggests that birds like the European robin use the spooky action to when they migrate. The method involves a light-sensitive protein called cryptochrome, which may contain entangled electrons. As photons enter the eye, they hit the cryptochrome molecules and can deliver enough energy to break them apart, forming two reactive molecules, or radicals, with unpaired but still entangled electrons. The magnetic field surrounding the bird influences how long these cryptochrome radicals last. Cells in the bird’s retina are thought to be very sensitive to the presence of the entangled radicals, allowing the animals to effectively ‘see’ a magnetic map based on the molecules. This process isn't full understood, though, and there is another option: Birds' magnetic sensitivity could be due to small crystals of magnetic minerals in their beaks. Still, if entanglement really is at play, experiments suggest that the delicate state must in a bird’s eye than in even the best artificial systems. The magnetic compass could also be applicable to certain lizards, crustaceans, insects and even some mammals. For instance, a form of cryptochrome used for magnetic navigation in flies has also been , although it’s unclear if it is or once was useful for a similar purpose.

If someone were to ask us the daily life or real-life examples of Quantum Physics, most of us would be totally unaware of it. But once you get to know about the real-life applications of Quantum Physics, you might wonder that the examples of the same were right in front of you! It may surprise you to know that Quantum Mechanics is able to explain our senses of sight, touch and smell. A number of such examples are described by Chad Orzel in a book with a catchy title “ Breakfast with Einstein”. Beginning with describing in the introduction a typical morning routine—waking up, making breakfast, checking his computer—Orzel breaks those actions down in order to “show how an ordinary weekday routine depends on some of the weirdest phenomena ever discovered.” For example, his alarm clock allows him to discuss, cogently, how the “modern accounting of time” that the device embodies is “deeply rooted in the quantum physics of atoms.” Orzel provides similar explanation for such phenomena as the different colors of light emitted by objects heated to different temperatures, using as an entry point the glowing coils of the burner on his stove top. Here is a list of a number of things which depend upon Quantum Physics for their operation. 1: Toaster: The bread toast which you enjoy while sipping on your morning tea is able to make its way to your plate only because of Quantum Physics. The heating element of the toaster glows red to toast a slice of bread. Toasters are generally referred to as the reason why Quantum Physics came into existence. The rod in the toaster gets hot, which, in turn, is responsible for toasting the bread. 2: Fluorescent light : The light which you are getting from the tubes or those curly bulbs is a result of a quantum phenomenon only.

An opportunity to disseminate knowledge to a non-academic audience and local companies which may be interested in innovating by taking advantage of the new technologies made available by the Trentino research system. Lorenzo Pavesi, professor of UniTrento and director of , was among the speakers Quantum technologies involve different research areas which exploit different aspects of quantum mechanics to solve a range of problems. These technologies can drive a new industrial revolution and enable huge progress in the coming years in cryptography, computing, communication and security. However, the physical phenomena that provide the foundations of these technologies, like the quantum entanglement and the quantum superposition, are not so easy to understand out of the research world. To inform citizens and businesses about the real impact that these technologies can have on society and industrial development, the , , and the lab organized an event named ""Tecnologie Quantistiche: dalla scienza all’impresa"". The local ecosystem of quantum sciences and technology is vibrant and lively, future-oriented, and ready to disseminate knowledge, from research to the market, through entities dedicated to technology transfer, like Fondazione HIT. A lot of basic research is conducted in Trentino, and the sector includes prototyping and small scale manufacturing; the main actors in the field are the and which, with their research projects, have attracted the attention of the international scientific community and received significant European funding. , for example, is a joint laboratory – established by the University of Trento, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, the National Research Council (CNR) and the National Institute of Nuclear Physics (INFN) – that promotes basic and applied research for the second quantum revolution.

If someone were to ask us the daily life or real-life examples of Quantum Physics, most of us would be totally unaware of it. But once you get to know about the real-life applications of Quantum Physics, you might wonder that the examples of the same were right in front of you! It may surprise you to know that Quantum Mechanics is able to explain our senses of sight, touch and smell. A number of such examples are described by Chad Orzel in a book with a catchy title “ Breakfast with Einstein”. Beginning with describing in the introduction a typical morning routine—waking up, making breakfast, checking his computer—Orzel breaks those actions down in order to “show how an ordinary weekday routine depends on some of the weirdest phenomena ever discovered.” For example, his alarm clock allows him to discuss, cogently, how the “modern accounting of time” that the device embodies is “deeply rooted in the quantum physics of atoms.” Orzel provides similar explanation for such phenomena as the different colors of light emitted by objects heated to different temperatures, using as an entry point the glowing coils of the burner on his stove top. Here is a list of a number of things which depend upon Quantum Physics for their operation. 1: Toaster: The bread toast which you enjoy while sipping on your morning tea is able to make its way to your plate only because of Quantum Physics. The heating element of the toaster glows red to toast a slice of bread. Toasters are generally referred to as the reason why Quantum Physics came into existence. The rod in the toaster gets hot, which, in turn, is responsible for toasting the bread. 2: Fluorescent light : The light which you are getting from the tubes or those curly bulbs is a result of a quantum phenomenon only. In fluorescent lighting, a small amount of mercury vapour is excited into the plasma. Mercury has the ability to emit light in the visible range. So, the next time you switch on the lights of your room at night, make sure you thank Quantum Physics. 3. Computer & Mobile Phone The whole computer world is based on the principle of Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics talks about the wave nature of electrons, and, so, this forms the basis of the band structure of solid objects on which semiconductor-based electronics are built. Not to forget that we are able to manipulate the electrical properties of silicon only because we can study the wave nature of electrons. Once the band structure is changed, the conductivity alters as well. How can the band structure be changed? Of course, Quantum Physics knows the answer! 4. Biological Compass If you think that only the humankind has been lucky enough to make use of Quantum Physics, you are totally wrong! According to theories by scientists, birds like European Robin make use of Quantum Physics to migrate. A light-sensitive protein called cryptochrome contains electrons. Photons, after entering the eyes of the bird, hit cryptochrome, and radicals are released. These radicals enable the bird to “see” a magnetic map. Another theory suggests that the beaks of the birds contain magnetic minerals. Crustaceans, lizards, insects, and even some mammals make use of such type of magnetic compass. You might be surprised to know the type of cryptochrome which is used for navigation by flies has also been found in the human eye! However, its use is unclear. 5. Transistor Transistors have widespread uses and are used to amplify or switch electrical signals and electrical power. Looking closely at the structure of transistors, we would realize that a transistor consists of layers of silicon associated with other elements. Computer chips are made by millions of these, and these computer chips form the powerhouse of all the technological gadgets which have become central to human existence. Had Quantum Physics not come into play, these chips would not have been created and neither would desktops, tablets, laptops, smartphones, and other gadgets have found their way into human life. 6. Laser: The principle on which laser works is based on Quantum Physics. The working of lasers involves spontaneous emission, thermal emission, and fluorescence. An electron, when excited, will jump to a high-energy level. However, it will not stay in the high-energy level for a long time, and jump back to the lower energy state which is more stable; and, thereby, emit light. The quantum mechanical state of the atom is also affected by external photons which are at a frequency associated with the atomic transition. 7. Microscopy Electron microscopy has improved with underlying principles of Quantum Physics. Quantum Physics in association and electron microscopy have improved the imaging of biological samples. Moreover, in differential interference contrast microscopy, a pattern of interference is created by the beam of photons, which is then analysed. All-in-one, with Quantum Physics, microscopy has improved to a great extent, and, therefore, a large amount of information from a sample can be obtained. 8. Global Positioning System (GPS) Navigating to unknown locations has never been easier as it has been with the aid of Quantum Physics. While using a mobile phone for navigation, the GPS receiver in the phone is responsible for picking up the signal from multiple clocks. The distance and time between your current location and the destination are calculated by calculating different arrival times from different satellites. Moreover, even the distance from your current location from each satellite is also calculated. Each satellite is equipped with an atomic clock, which relies on Quantum Physics only. 9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging Magnetic Resonance Imaging, also known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, involves the reversal of the spins of the electrons in hydrogen nuclei. So, basically, we are talking of shift in energies; which is nothing but one of the applications of Quantum Physics. The study of soft tissues can easily be carried out with the use of MRI. Thanks to Quantum Physics that the diagnosis and treatment of some life-threatening ailments have been possible. 10. Telecommunication Communication has been made extremely easy because of the important role of Quantum Physics. Fibre optic telecommunication has made possible two-way and quick communication. The fibre optic telecommunication is possible only because of lasers, which are devices of Quantum Physics. Here are two resources for further exploration of this greatest human endeavour ever: A link to an article with 10 examples : Breakfast with Einstein: the exotic Physics of everyday objects by Chad Orzel This erudite book will be best read in multiple sittings by curious readers keen on absorbing all the weird science on display all around them.

This physics framework is responsible for any number of bizarre phenomena—theoretical cats , particles kilometers apart , and indecisive photons at once. But it is also responsible for the technological advances that make modern life possible. Without quantum mechanics there would be no transistor, and hence no personal computer; no laser, and hence no Blu-ray players. , a physics professor at the University of Minnesota, wants people to understand how much quantum mechanics influences our everyday lives—but to do so people must first understand quantum mechanics. Kakalios sets out to tackle both tasks in (Gotham Books, 2010), an accessible, mostly math-free treatment of one of the most complex topics in science. To keep things lively, the author intersperses illustrations and analogies from Buck Rogers stories and other classic science fiction tales. We spoke to Kakalios about his new book, what quantum mechanics has made possible, and how early sci-fi visions of the future compare with the present as we know it. [An edited transcript of the interview follows.] Is the purpose of this book to expose this world of quantum mechanics that people find so mysterious and point out that it's everywhere? That's right. In fact, the introduction is called, ""Quantum physics? You're soaking in it!"" There are many excellent books about the history and the philosophical underpinnings of quantum mechanics. But there didn't seem to be many that talked about how useful quantum mechanics is. Yes, the science has weird ideas and it can be confusing. But one of the most amazing things about quantum mechanics is that you can use it correctly and productively even if you're confused by it. I present in the introduction what I call a ""workingman's view"" of quantum mechanics and show how if you accept on faith three weird ideas—that light is a photon; that matter has a wavelength nature associated with its motion; and that everything, light and matter, has an intrinsic angular momentum or spin that can only have discrete values—it turns out that you can then see how lasers work. You can see how a transistor works or your computer hard drive or magnetic resonance imaging—a host of technologies that we take for granted that pretty much define our life. There were computers before the transistor; they used vacuum tubes as logic elements. To make a more powerful computer meant that you had to have more vacuum tubes. They were big, they generated a lot of heat, they were fragile. You had to make the room and the computer very large. And so if you used vacuum tubes, only the government and a few large corporations would have the most powerful computers. You wouldn't have millions of them across the country. There would be no reason to hook them all together into an Internet, and there would be no World Wide Web. The beautiful aspect to this is the scientists who developed this were not trying to make a cell phone; they were not trying to invent a CD player. If you went to Schrödinger in 1926 and said, ""Nice equation, Erwin. What's it good for?"" He's not going to say, ""Well, if you want to store music in a compact digital format..."" But without the curiosity-driven understanding of how atoms behave, how they interact with each other, and how they interact with light, the world we live in would be profoundly different. So, to take one example, how does quantum mechanics make the laser possible? One of the most basic consequences of quantum mechanics is that there is a wave associated with the motion of all matter, including electrons in an atom. Schrödinger came up with an equation that said: ""You tell me the forces acting on the electron, and I can tell you what its wave is doing at any point in space and time."" And Max Born said that by manipulating this wave function that Schrödinger developed, you could tell the probability of finding the electron at any point in space and time. From that, it turns out that the electron can only have certain discrete energies inside an atom. This had been discovered experimentally; this is the source of the famous line spectrum that atoms exhibit and that accounts for why neon lights are red whereas sodium streetlights have a yellow tinge. It has to do with the line spectra of their respective elements. But to have an actual understanding of where these discrete energies come from—that electrons and atoms can only have certain energies and no other—is one of the most amazing things about quantum mechanics. It's as though you are driving a car on a racetrack and you are only allowed to go in multiples of 10 miles per hour. When you take that and you bring many atoms together, all of those energies broaden out into a band of possible energies. The analogy that I use is you have an auditorium with an orchestra below and a balcony above. That means to go from the orchestra to the balcony you have to absorb some energy to be promoted from the orchestra to the balcony. Now if every seat in the orchestra is filled, and you want to move from one seat to another, you can't go anywhere unless you absorb some energy and are promoted up into the balcony, where there are empty seats and you can move around. What happens in a laser is you have a little mezzanine right below the balcony. You get promoted up to the balcony but then you fall and you sit in the mezzanine. And eventually, as the mezzanine gets filled up, there's a bunch of empty seats in the orchestra, where you came from. One person gets pushed out of the mezzanine, and because of the way they talk to each other, they all go at the same time. They release energy as they fall back from the mezzanine into the orchestra, and that energy is in the form of light. Because they are all coming from the same row of seats in the mezzanine, all the light has exactly the same color. Since they all went at the same time, they are all coherently in phase. And if you have a lot of them up in the mezzanine, you can have a very high intensity beam of single-color light. That's a laser. And just as Schrödinger couldn't have had any idea about what his equation would be used for, the same could be said of the laser, which now allows us to have CDs and DVDs and a lot of other things. The same goes for the transistor. It was first developed to amplify radio signals, and you had transistor radios that replaced the vacuum tubes that were being used. Now they are also used as logic elements, 1s and 0s. If you apply a voltage to a transistor you can basically open or close a gate and allow electrons to flow through or make it very difficult for electrons to flow. And so you have two different current states, high and low, that you can call a 1 or a 0. You can combine them in clever ways to do logic operations with the 1s and 0s. You can encode information. You can develop a language of the 1s and 0s and manipulate them that way. And again, I don't think that was the first thought of the people that developed the transistor. Look at all the things that it has brought out. There are probably more transistors in a standard hospital than there are stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, when you think about all the computers and all the electronic devices that we use just for medical applications. So it really has transformed life in a very profound way. The real are a small handful of people who knew they were changing physics, but I don't think they recognized that they were also changing the future. One of the ways you keep this book lively and accessible is to use anecdotes from early science fiction. How well have those predictions held up? The main problem is that they believed that there was going to be a revolution in energy, which would lead to jet packs, death rays and flying cars. But what we got was a revolution in information. This information age, of course, came about because of semiconductors and solid-state physics, which were enabled by quantum mechanics. A lot of these things go back to transistors and semiconductors. Is that in your view the biggest fundamental leap that quantum mechanics allowed us to make? More than that, even. By discerning what were the fundamental rules that govern how atoms interact with each other and how they interact with light, you also have now a fundamental understanding of chemistry. There is a reason why the atoms are arranged the way they are in the periodic table of the elements, and it comes out naturally from the Schrödinger equation when you add in the Pauli exclusion principle. There is a really deep appreciation for why the world is the way it is. Can you imagine living in a world before quantum mechanics? We take all these things for granted. It's like the Louis C. K. YouTube clip—. ""Quantum"" is thrown around a lot as a label for things we don't understand, and we often lump a number of phenomena into the vague category of ""quantum weirdness"". Is that something that you'd like to see dissipate? I would. It's used too much as a catchall. Proposing weird and counterintuitive ideas to explain observations, developing the consequences of these ideas and testing them further, and then, if they conform with reality, accepting them is not unique to quantum mechanics. It's what we call physics. Also, because it has a reputation for weirdness, quantum mechanics is used too much as a justification for things that have nothing to do with quantum mechanics. There is an expression, ""quantum woo,"" where people take a personal philosophy, such as or let a smile be your umbrella, and somehow affix quantum mechanics to it to try to make it sound scientific. And make a lot of money doing so. Yeah. It kind of seems to me to be at the same level as using mathematical knot theory or topology to justify crossing your fingers when you're making a wish. It has about as much relevance and justification. ABOUT THE AUTHOR(S)John Matson is a former reporter and editor for Scientific American who has written extensively about astronomy and physics.

Share this This article was reviewed by a member of Caltech's Faculty. While some applications of quantum physics may seem far off, quantum principles are already at work in many technologies available today. For example, a common kitchen appliance demonstrates one of the phenomena that led to the founding of quantum science. Inside our toasters, there are metallic elements that glow red when they heat up. Heat any material to the same temperature and the same thing will happen: if you get them hot enough, all materials, metal or not, will glow red, then yellow, then white as they get hotter. This observation provided insight into the field of quantum science. Physicists in the late 1800s and early 1900s proposed that energy emitted from these heated elements was restricted to certain wavelengths. This restricted range is due to the nature of energy.More sophisticated applications of quantum technology are listed below. They highlight the subatomic nature of quantum physics. Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Image Lightbox Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Fluorescent LightsFluorescent bulbs contain electrodes that heat up and eject electrons. These electrons, in turn, bombard a tiny amount of mercury that is also inside the bulb. The collisions cause the mercury's electrons to jump up to a higher quantum energy state. High-energy electrons tend to jump back down to their lower state, and when they do, photons are emitted, producing the light we see. Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Image Lightbox Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange SemiconductorsAs their name implies, semiconductors are materials that have an electrical conductivity between that of a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, such as glass. Semiconductors are able to accommodate a wide range of currents and voltages, making them useful in everyday electronics such as computers, LED lights, TVs, cell phones, and smart devices. In fact, the rise of all electronics is directly linked to our understanding of quantum mechanics.Electrical conductance can be thought of as the ability for electrons to be shared or delocalized among atoms in a material as a result of their quantum superposition. Conducting metals permit a lot of electron delocalization, enabling them to conduct electricity easily. Insulators prevent the flow of electricity. Semiconductors are crystalline materials whose properties fall between those of conductors and insulators. Moreover, pure semiconductors are sometimes modified by the intentional introduction of impurities—a process called doping—to make their conducting and insulating properties more useful. Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Image Lightbox Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange LasersLasers can emit concentrated beams of light because the light waves are all going in the same direction, and they are coherent, meaning they have identical frequencies and waveforms. The generation of laser light relies on a technique called stimulated emission, in which a photon is used to stimulate an already excited atomic electron to drop down to a lower quantum energy state and release two identical photons that travel coherently. This process is repeated in a reflective chamber until many photons are coherent and emitted together. The word laser is an acronym for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Image Lightbox Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange MRIHydrogen-dense water and fat molecules are stored in different amounts throughout the body, depending on the composition of a person's tissues and organs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses these differences to generate highly detailed pictures.The positively charged proton of a hydrogen atom has a quantum spin associated with it, and a spinning charged particle creates a magnetic field. Normally, the magnetic fields of the trillions and trillions of hydrogen atoms in the body are pointed in different directions, but when a strong external magnetic field is applied, the axes of the atomic magnetic fields align. Specially tuned radio frequency pulses are then applied, which temporarily knock some of hydrogen atoms out of alignment again. Between pulses, the atoms realign with the external field. During this process, areas of the body with more hydrogen atoms can be detected and differentiated from areas with fewer hydrogen atoms. Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Image Lightbox Joel Caswell for Caltech Science Exchange Atomic ClocksToday, typical clocks rely on quartz crystals to keep time. When voltage is applied to them, the crystals vibrate at a precise frequency, and that vibration can be used to measure time within a margin of error of one billionth of a second every hour.A more precise clock is needed for some applications. Instead of using the vibrational frequency of a quartz crystal, atomic clocks are calibrated against the microwave frequency required to move an electron in an atom or ion from a lower quantum energy state to a higher one. Using this technology, time can be measured within a margin of error of only 1 second in up to 100 million years.Atomic clocks are integral to global positioning systems, including those found in our mobile phones. They are also used to send signals to spacecraft to determine their position. One of the most stable atomic clocks in development is NASA's Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC), which will use mercury ions to measure time. Since ions have a net electric charge, they can be contained in an electromagnetic trap to prevent them from interacting with interfering signals from the environment, which can lead to frequency errors.The DSAC demonstrates the need for the special conditions that are usually necessary for quantum technology to work. Even the observation of some quantum systems is enough to disrupt those systems, which are very sensitive to external factors such as temperature. Exotic materials and conditions such as vacuum chambers or extremely cold temperatures are often used to shield quantum systems from outside influences.

Short History: Quantum mechanics is linked with the history of quantum chemistry as it began with the discovery of cathode rays, by Michael Faraday (1859 -60) and later with the winter statement of the black body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff. The quantum hypothesis was given by Max Planck (1900). Then Albert Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect, but was previously given by Heinrich Hertz in 1887. He postulated with Max Planck’s quantum hypothesis that light is made of individual quantum particles. : Image by from In quantum mechanics, objects exist in a haze of probability, as a particle can be at point A and also can be at point B.

Quantum Teleportation: Quantum teleportation is a technique for transferring quantum information from one place to another. It relies on the principles of quantum entanglement, which allows particles to be linked in a way that their states are correlated, even when separated by large distances. FAQs: Can quantum mechanics be used for faster-than-light communication? No, quantum mechanics does not allow for faster-than-light communication. While it does involve entangled particles that can be connected even when separated by large distances, the principles of causality and relativity mean that information cannot be transmitted faster than the speed of light. How does quantum mechanics relate to the development of new materials? Quantum mechanics is essential for understanding the behavior of materials at the atomic and subatomic levels, which is important for designing and developing new materials with specific properties. For example, quantum mechanics can be used to predict the electronic and optical properties of materials, as well as their thermal and mechanical properties.

fluorescence and phosphorescence light emission Fluorescence and Phosphorescence Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. It is a form of photoluminescence. In most cases, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. However, when the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is intense, it is possible for one electron to absorb two photons; this two-photon absorption can lead to emission of radiation having a shorter wavelength than the absorbed radiation. The emitted radiation may also be of the same wavelength as the absorbed radiation, termed “resonance fluorescence”. Fluorescence occurs when an orbital electron of a molecule or atom relaxes to its ground state by emitting a photon of light after being excited to a higher quantum state by some type of energy. The most striking examples of fluorescence occur when the absorbed radiation is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and thus invisible to the human eye, and the emitted light is in the visible region. Fluorescence: Fluorescent minerals emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet light Phosphorescence is a specific type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence. Unlike fluorescence, a phosphorescent material does not immediately re-emit the radiation it absorbs. Excitation of electrons to a higher state is accompanied with the change of a spin state. Once in a different spin state, electrons cannot relax into the ground state quickly because the re-emission involves quantum mechanically forbidden energy state transitions. As these transitions occur very slowly in certain materials, absorbed radiation may be re-emitted at a lower intensity for up to several hours after the original excitation. Fluorescence and Phosphorescence: Energy scheme used to explain the difference between fluorescence and phosphorescence Commonly seen examples of phosphorescent materials are the glow-in-the-dark toys, paint, and clock dials that glow for some time after being charged with a bright light such as in any normal reading or room light. Typically the glowing then slowly fades out within minutes (or up to a few hours) in a dark room. Phosphorescence: Phosphorescent material glowing in the dark. Lasers A laser is a device that emits monochromatic light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of photons. learning objectives Identify process that generates laser emission and the defining characteristics of laser light A laser is a device that emits monochromatic light (electromagnetic radiation ). It does so through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of photons. The term “laser” originated as an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Laser is distinct from other light sources for its high degree of spatial and temporal coherence, which means that laser outputs a narrow beam that maintains its temporal-phase relationship. Principles of laser operation are largely based on quantum mechanics. (One exception would be free-electron lasers, whose operation can be explained solely by classical electrodynamics. ) When an electron is excited from a lower-energy to a higher-energy level, it will not stay that way forever. An electron in an excited state may decay to an unoccupied lower-energy state according to a particular time constant characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external influence, it emits a photon; this process is called “spontaneous emission. ” The phase associated with the emitted photon is random. A material with many atoms in an excited state may thus result in radiation that is very monochromatic, but the individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would emanate in random directions. This is the mechanism of fluorescence and thermal emission. However, an external photon at a frequency associated with the atomic transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom. As the incident photon passes by, the rate of transitions of the excited atom can be significantly enhanced beyond that due to spontaneous emission. This “induced” decay process is called stimulated emission. In stimulated emission, the decaying atom produces an identical “copy” of the incoming photon. Therefore, after the atom decays, we have two identical outgoing photons. Since there was only one incoming photon, we amplified the intensity of light by a factor of 2! Stimulated Photon Emission: In stimulated emission process, a photon (with a frequency equal to the atomic transition) encounters an excited atom, and a new photon identical to the incoming photon is produced. The result is an atom in the ground state with two outgoing photons. Holography Holography is an optical technique which enables three-dimensional images to be made. learning objectives Explain how holographic images are recorded and their properties Holography is a technique which enables three-dimensional images to be made. It involves the use of a laser, interference, diffraction, light intensity recording and suitable illumination of the recording. The image changes as the position and orientation of the viewing system changes in exactly the same way as if the object were still present, thus making the image appear three-dimensional. Laser: Holograms are recorded using a flash of light that illuminates a scene and then imprints on a recording medium, much in the way a photograph is recorded. In addition, however, part of the light beam must be shone directly onto the recording medium – this second light beam is known as the reference beam (]). A hologram requires a laser as the sole light source. Laser is required as a light source to produce an interference pattern on the recording plate. To prevent external light from interfering, holograms are usually taken in darkness, or in low level light of a different color from the laser light used in making the hologram. Holography requires a specific exposure time, which can be controlled using a shutter, or by electronically timing the laser Recording a hologram: Holograms are recorded using a flash of light that illuminates a scene and then imprints on a recording medium, much in the way a photograph is recorded. In addition, however, part of the light beam must be shone directly onto the recording medium – this second light beam is known as the reference beam. Apparatus: A hologram can be made by shining part of the light beam directly onto the recording medium, and the other part onto the object in such a way that some of the scattered light falls onto the recording medium. A more flexible arrangement for recording a hologram requires the laser beam to be aimed through a series of elements that change it in different ways. The first element is a beam splitter that divides the beam into two identical beams, each aimed in different directions: One beam (known as the illumination or object beam) is spread using lenses and directed onto the scene using mirrors. Some of the light scattered (reflected) from the scene then falls onto the recording medium. The second beam (known as the reference beam) is also spread through the use of lenses, but is directed so that it doesn’t come in contact with the scene, and instead travels directly onto the recording medium. Reconstructing a hologram: An interference pattern can be considered an encoded version of a scene, requiring a particular key – the original light source – in order to view its contents. This missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram, onto the developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is diffracted by the hologram’s surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram Several different materials can be used as the recording medium. One of the most common is a film very similar to photographic film (silver halide photographic emulsion), but with a much higher concentration of light-reactive grains, making it capable of the much higher resolution that holograms require. A layer of this recording medium (e.g. silver halide) is attached to a transparent substrate, which is commonly glass, but may also be plastic. Process: When the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and interfere with each other. It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. The pattern itself is seemingly random, as it represents the way in which the scene’s light interfered with the original light source – but not the original light source itself. The interference pattern can be considered an encoded version of the scene, requiring a particular key – the original light source – in order to view its contents. This missing key is provided later by shining a laser, identical to the one used to record the hologram, onto the developed film. When this beam illuminates the hologram, it is diffracted by the hologram’s surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram. The image this effect produces in a person’s retina is known as a virtual image. The Periodic Table of Elements A periodic table is a tabular display of elements organized by their atomic numbers, electron configurations, and chemical properties. learning objectives Explain how properties of elements vary within groups and across periods in the periodic table The periodic table is a tabular display of the chemical elements. The elements are organized based on their atomic numbers, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. In the periodic table, elements are presented in order of increasing atomic number (the number of protons). The rows of the table are called periods; the columns of the s- (columns 1-2 and He), d- (columns 3-12), and p-blocks (columns 13-18, except He) are called groups. (The terminology of s-, p-, and d- blocks originate from the valence atomic orbitals the element’s electrons occupy. ) Some groups have specific names, such as the halogens or the noble gases. Since, by definition, a periodic table incorporates recurring trends, any such table can be used to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and predict the properties of new, yet-to-be-discovered, or synthesized elements. As a result, the periodic table provides a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior, and such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences. Blocks in the Periodic Table: A diagram of the periodic table, highlighting the different blocks History of the Periodic Table Although precursors exist, Dmitri Mendeleev is generally credited with the publication, in 1869, of the first widely recognized periodic table. Mendeleev designed the table in such a way that recurring (“periodic”) trends in the properties of the elements could be shown. Using the trends he observed, he even left gaps for those elements that he thought were “missing. ” He even predicted the properties that he thought the missing elements would have when they were discovered. Many of these elements were indeed later discovered, and Mendeleev’s predictions were proved to be correct. Groups Agroup, or family, is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than do periods and blocks, which are explained below. Modern quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure explain group trends by proposing that elements in the same group generally have the same electron configurations in their valence (or outermost, partially filled) shell. Consequently, elements in the same group tend to have shared chemistry and exhibit a clear trend in properties with increasing atomic number. However, in some parts of the periodic table, such as the d-block and the f-block, horizontal similarities can be as important as, or more pronounced than, vertical similarities. Periods A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where horizontal trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as in the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial horizontal series of elements. Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electron affinity. Atomic radius usually decreases from left to right across a period. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus, decreasing the radius. The periodic table: Here is the complete periodic table with atomic numbers, groups, and periods. Each entry on the periodic table represents one element, and compounds are made up of several of these elements. X-Rays X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation and have wavelengths in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers. learning objectives Describe the properties of X-rays and how can be generated X-radiation (composed of x-rays) is a form of electromagnetic radiation. X-rays have wavelengths in the range of 0.01 to 10 nanometers, which corresponds to frequencies in the range of 30 petahertz to 30 exahertz (3·1016 Hz to 3·1019 Hz) and energies in the of range 100 eV to 100 keV. X-Ray Spectrum and Applications: X-rays are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, with wavelengths shorter than those of visible light. Different applications use different parts of the X-ray spectrum. X-rays can be generated by an x-ray tube, a vacuum tube that uses high voltage to accelerate the electrons released by a hot cathode to a high velocity. The high-velocity electrons collide with a metal target, the anode, creating the x-rays. The maximum energy of the produced x-ray photon is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80-kV tube cannot create x-rays with an energy greater than 80 keV. When the electrons hit the target, x-rays are created through two different atomic processes: X-ray fluorescence, if the electron has enough energy that it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner electron shell of a metal atom. As a result, electrons from higher energy levels fill up the vacancy, and x-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an emission spectrum of x-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and therefore are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into the K shell (called K lines), or the L shell (called L lines), and so on. Bremsstrahlung, literally meaning braking radiation. Bremsstrahlung is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-Z (proton number) nuclei. These x-rays have a continuous spectrum. The intensity of the x-rays increases linearly with decreasing frequency, from zero at the energy of the incident electrons, the voltage on the x-ray tube. Both of these x-ray production processes are inefficient, with a production efficiency of only about one percent. Therefore, to produce a usable flux of x-rays, most of the electric power consumed by the tube is released as heat waste. The x-ray tube must be designed to dissipate this excess heat. A specialized source of x-rays that is becoming widely used in research is synchrotron radiation, which is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are x-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of x-ray tubes, wide x-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization. Quantum-Mechanical View of Atoms Atom is a basic unit of matter that consists of a nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electron cloud, commonly called atomic orbitals. learning objectives Identify major contributions to the understanding of atomic structure that were made by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, and Werner Heisenberg The atom is a basic unit of matter that consists of a nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. The atomic nucleus contains a mix of positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons. The electrons of an atom are bound to the nucleus by the electromagnetic (Coulomb) force. Atoms are minuscule objects with diameters of a few tenths of a nanometer and tiny masses proportional to the volume implied by these dimensions. Atoms in solid states (or, to be precise, their electron clouds) can be observed individually using special instruments such as the scanning tunneling microscope. Hydrogen-1 (one proton + one electron) is the simplest form of atoms, and not surprisingly, our quantum mechanical understanding of atoms evolved with the understanding of this species. In 1913, physicist Niels Bohr suggested that the electrons were confined into clearly defined, quantized orbits, and could jump between these, but could not freely spiral inward or outward in intermediate states. An electron must absorb or emit specific amounts of energy to transition between these fixed orbits. Bohr’s model successfully explained spectroscopic data of hydrogen very well, but it adopted a semiclassical approach where electron was still considered a (classical) particle. Adopting Louis de Broglie’s proposal of wave-particle duality, Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, developed a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles. A consequence of using waveforms to describe particles is that it is mathematically impossible to obtain precise values for both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time; this became known as the uncertainty principle, formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. Thereafter, the planetary model of the atom was discarded in favor of one that described atomic orbital zones around the nucleus where a given electron is most likely to be observed. Illustration of the Helium Atom: This is an illustration of the helium atom, depicting the nucleus (pink) and the electron cloud distribution (black). The nucleus (upper right) in helium-4 is in reality spherically symmetric and closely resembles the electron cloud, although for more complicated nuclei this is not always the case. The black bar is one angstrom (10-10 m, or 100 pm). Modern quantum mechanical view of hydrogen has evolved further after Schrödinger, by taking relativistic correction terms into account. Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a relativistic quantum field theory describing the interaction of electrically charged particles, has successfully predicted minuscule corrections in energy levels. One of the hydrogen’s atomic transitions (n=2 to n=1, n: principal quantum number) has been measured to an extraordinary precision of 1 part in a hundred trillion. This kind of spectroscopic precision allows physicists to refine quantum theories of atoms, by accounting for minuscule discrepancies between experimental results and theories. Key Points The emitted light usually has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation. Fluorescence occurs when an orbital electron of a molecule or atom relaxes to its ground state by emitting a photon of light after being excited to a higher quantum state by some type of energy. In a phosphorescence, excitation of electrons to a higher state is accompanied with the change of a spin state. Relaxation is a slow process since it involves energy state transitions “forbidden” in quantum mechanics. Principles of laser operation are largely based on quantum mechanics, most importantly on the process of the stimulated emission of photons. Spontaneous emission is a random decaying process. The phase associated with the emitted photon is also random. Atomic transition can be stimulated by the presence of an incoming photon at a frequency associated with the atomic transition. This process leads to optical amplification as an identical photon is emitted along with the incoming photon. When the two laser beams reach the recording medium, their light waves intersect and interfere with each other. It is this interference pattern that is imprinted on the recording medium. When a reconstruction beam illuminates the hologram, it is diffracted by the hologram’s surface pattern. This produces a light field identical to the one originally produced by the scene and scattered onto the hologram. Holographic image changes as the position and orientation of the viewing system changes in exactly the same way as if the object were still present, thus making the image appear three-dimensional. A periodic table is a useful framework for analyzing chemical behavior. Such tables are widely used in chemistry and other sciences. A group, or family, is a vertical column in the periodic table. Groups usually have more significant periodic trends than do periods and blocks. A period is a horizontal row in the periodic table. Elements in the same period show trends in atomic radius, ionization energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. X-rays can be generated by an x-ray tube, a vacuum tube, or a particle accelerator. X-ray fluorescence and Bremsstrahlung are processes through which x-rays are produced. Synchrotron radiation is generated by particle accelerators. Its unique features are x-ray outputs many orders of magnitude greater than those of x-ray tubes, wide x-ray spectra, excellent collimation, and linear polarization. Niels Bohr suggested that the electrons were confined into clearly defined, quantized orbits, and could jump between these, but could not freely spiral inward or outward in intermediate states. Erwin Schrödinger, in 1926, developed a mathematical model of the atom that described the electrons as three-dimensional waveforms rather than point particles.

Following this modern branch of physics often leads to delightful (or disturbing, depending on your point of view) speculations about the nature of reality. But just like the rest of us, quantum physics has to get up in the morning, put on its shoes and go to work. Here are a few places quantum physics shows up in your everyday life.Your SmartphoneThough we don’t have fully operational quantum computers quite yet, we wouldn’t have any electronic computers without quantum mechanics. Superposition — the weird property of quantum physics that keeps alive and dead at the same time — is what makes possible the computer you’re using to read this.Thanks to quantum physics, scientists gained an understanding of the dual nature of electrons; namely, that they have properties of both particles and waves. Or as Italian physicist Carlos Rovelli put it in his book Reality Is Not What It Seems, an electron “is diffused in a cloud of probability in all places.”This means an electron can belong to more than one atom at the same time. In fact, an electron can be shared among lots of atoms. (This is how chemical bonds are formed.)Understanding this behavior makes it possible to manipulate the properties of semiconductors, such as silicon. Combining silicon with various other elements to take advantage of their different properties is the basis for creating the tiny transistors inside computers, phones and other electronic devices. In other words, much of what makes the modern world possible.Your Smartphone’s CameraYour phone’s camera also relies on the quantum physics behind semiconductors. The photo detectors or photo diodes in the camera respond to light in the form of a current of electrons. Again, it’s our knowledge of the behavior of electrons that enables us to take advantage of the properties of semiconductors — and the more we understand these properties, the better we can tweak our cameras.So, if you’re continually amazed at the quality of your cell’s photos (and notice that they get better with each phone upgrade), you have the weird behavior of quantum particles to thank.Your ClockYou might have gained an hour of sleep when daylight savings time changed to standard time, but you probably didn’t have to remember to reset your clocks on your phone and computer. That’s because the clocks on our electronic devices get the correct time from atomic clocks, which utilize one of the properties of the quantum world.Like the pendulum in an old-fashioned grandfather clock, the frequency of transitions between two energy states in a cesium-133 atom tick back and forth. Because these oscillations are extremely regular, they provide a very accurate way to keep time. Making use of this fact of nature requires an understanding of quantum physics.GPS uses this super-accurate timekeeping as well: Satellites have very accurate clocks that continually broadcast their time, and your GPS device can figure out where on Earth it is by noting how long it takes satellite signals to reach it.So, yes, quantum physics is weird. But what would we do without it?1 free article leftWant More?

Prior to joining Built In, he was a digital editor at the design-focused Sixtysix Magazine and associate editor at Chicagoist. Image: Shutterstock Staff Reporter, Updates at Built InUPDATED BY | Jun 08, 2022 Slowly but surely, is getting ready for its closeup.Google made headlines in October 2019 upon proclaiming that it had achieved the long-anticipated breakthrough of “quantum supremacy.” That’s when a quantum is able to perform a task a conventional computer can’t. Not in a practical amount of time, anyway. For instance, Google claimed the test problem it ran would have taken a classical computer thousands of years to complete — though some critics and competitors that a gross . IBM, for one, wasn’t having it. The other big player in quantum, it promptly posted a response essentially arguing that Google had underestimated the muscle of IBM supercomputers — which, though blazingly fast, aren’t of the quantum variety. Tech giant head-butting aside, Google’s achievement was a genuine milestone — one that further established quantum computing in the broader consciousness and prompted more people to wonder: What will these things actually do?10 Quantum Computing Applications to KnowArtificial intelligenceBetter batteriesCleaner fertilizationCybersecurityDrug developmentElectronic materials discoveryFinancial modelingSolar captureTraffic optimizationWeather forecasting and climate changeBut even once quantum computing reigns supreme, its potential impact remains largely theoretical. But that’s more a reflection of quantum computing’s still-fledgling status than unfulfilled promise.Before commercial-scale quantum computing is a thing, however, researchers must clear some major hurdles. Chief among them is upping the number of qubits, units of information that these impressive pieces of use to perform tasks. Whereas classical computer “bits” exist as 1s or 0s, qubits can be either — or both simultaneously. That’s key to massively greater processing speeds, which are necessary to simulate molecular-level quantum mechanics.Despite quantum’s still-hypothetical nature and the long road ahead, predictions and abound. Google CEO Sundar Pichai likened his company’s recent proof-of-concept advancement to the Wright brothers’ 12-second flight: Though very basic and short-lived, it demonstrated what’s possible. And what’s possible, experts say, is impressive indeed.From cybersecurity to pharmaceutical research to finance, here are some ways quantum computing facilitates major advancements.More on Quantum Computing 10 Companies Utilizing Quantum ComputingLocation: Armonk, New York may prove to be mutual back-scratchers. As VentureBeat , advances in deep learning will likely increase our understanding of quantum mechanics while at the same time fully realized quantum computers could far surpass conventional ones in data pattern recognition. Regarding the latter, ’s quantum research team has that entangling qubits on the quantum computer that ran a data-classification experiment cut the error rate in half compared to unentangled qubits.“What this suggests,” an in the MIT Technology Review noted, “is that as quantum computers get better at harnessing qubits and at entangling them, they’ll also get better at tackling machine-learning problems.”IBM’s research came in the wake of another promising machine-learning classification algorithm: a quantum-classical hybrid run on a 19-qubit machine built by . “Harnessing [quantum computers’ statistical distribution] has the potential to accelerate or otherwise improve machine learning relative to purely classical performance,” . The hybridization of classical compute and quantum processors overcame “a key challenge” in realizing that aim, they explained. Both are important steps toward the ultimate goal of significantly . Which might mean that understand you the first time. Or non-player-controlled video game characters that . The potential advancements are numerous.“I think AI can accelerate quantum computing,"" , ""and quantum computing can accelerate AI.” Location: New York, New York The list of partners that comprise Microsoft’s so-called Quantum Network includes a slew of research universities and quantum-focused technical outfits, but precious few business affiliates. However, two of the five — NatWest and Willis Towers Watson — are banking interests. Similarly, at IBM’s Q Network, stands out amid a sea of tech-focused members as well as government and higher-ed research institutions.That hugely profitable financial services companies would want to leverage paradigm-shifting technology is hardly a shocker, but quantum and financial modeling are a truly natural match thanks to structural similarities. As a group of European researchers last year, “[T]he entire financial market can be modeled as a quantum process, where quantities that are important to finance, such as the , emerge naturally.”A lot of recent research has focused specifically on quantum’s potential to dramatically speed up the so-called Monte Carlo model, which essentially gauges the probability of various outcomes and their corresponding risks. co-written by IBM researchers and members of JPMorgan’s Quantitative Research team included a methodology to price option contracts using a quantum computer.Its seemingly clear risk-assessment application aside, quantum in finance could have a broad future. “If we had [a commercial quantum computer] today, what would we do?”, a co-author of the price-options paper, wondered. “The answer today is not very clear.” Location: Redmond, WashingtonThe world has a fertilizer problem that extends beyond an . Much of the planet’s fertilizer is made by heating and pressurizing atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a process pioneered in the early 1900s by German chemist Fritz Haber.The so-called Haber process, though revolutionary, proved quite energy-consuming: some three percent of annual global energy output goes into running Haber, which accounts for more than one percent of greenhouse gas emissions. More maddening, some bacteria perform that process naturally — we simply have no idea how and therefore can’t leverage it.With an adequate quantum computer, however, we could probably — and, in doing so, significantly conserve energy. In 2017, researchers from that’s necessary to simulate. And they’ll do that just as soon as the quantum hardware has a sufficient qubit count and noise stabilization. Google’s CEO he thinks the quantum improvement of Haber is roughly a decade away.Related Reading Location: Berkeley, CaliforniaRecent research into whether quantum computing might vastly improve weather prediction has determined… ! And while we still have little understanding of that relationship, many in the field view it as a notable use case. Ray Johnson, the former CTO at Lockheed Martin and now an independent director at quantum startup , is among those who’ve indicated that quantum computing’s method of simultaneous (rather than sequential) calculation will likely be successful in “analyzing the very, very complex system of variables that is weather.”While we currently use some of the world’s most powerful supercomputers to model high-resolution weather forecasts, accurate numerical weather prediction is notoriously difficult. In fact, it probably hasn’t been that long since you cursed an off-the-mark meteorologist. Location: London, England To presidential candidate Andrew Yang, Google’s quantum milestone meant that “no code is uncrackable.” He was referring to a much-discussed that the unprecedented power of quantum computers would severely undermine common internet encryption systems.But Google’s device (like all current QC devices) is far too error-prone to pose the immediate cybersecurity threat that Yang implied. In fact, , such a machine won’t exist for quite a while. But the looming danger is serious. And the years-long push toward quantum-resistant algorithms — like the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s to build such models — illustrates how seriously the security community takes the threat.One of just 26 so-called post-quantum algorithms to make the NIST’s “semifinals” comes from, appropriately enough, British-based cybersecurity leader . Experts say the careful and deliberate process exemplified by the NIST’s project is precisely what quantum-focused security needs. As Dr. Deborah Franke of the National Security Agency told Nextgov, “There are two ways you could make a mistake with quantum-resistant encryption: One is you could jump to the algorithm too soon, and the other is you jump to the algorithm too late.” Location: Toronto, Ontario “The real excitement about quantum is that the universe fundamentally works in a quantum way, so you will be able to understand nature better,” Google’s Pichai in the wake of his company’s recent announcement. “It’s early days, but where quantum mechanics shines is the ability to simulate molecules, molecular processes, and I think that is where it will be the strongest. Drug discovery is a great example.”One company focusing computational heft on molecular simulation, specifically protein behavior, is Toronto-based biotech startup . Flush with in recent seed funding as of 2019, it partners with quantum-computing leaders (IBM, Microsoft and Rigetti Computing) and pharma research outfits (SRI International, AstraZeneca) to explore QC’s potential in modeling protein.That’s the deeply complex but high-yield route of drug development in which proteins are engineered for targeted medical purposes. Although it’s vastly more precise than the old-school trial-and-error method of running chemical experiments, it’s infinitely more challenging from a computational standpoint. , merely modeling a penicillin molecule would require an impossibly large classical computer with 10-to-the-86th-power bits. For advanced quantum computers, though, that same process could be a snap — and could lead to the discovery of new drugs for serious maladies like cancer, Alzheimer’s and heart disease.Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen is another notable company exploring quantum computing’s capacity for drug development. Focused on neurological disease research, the biotech firm announced a 2017 partnership with quantum startup 1QBit and Accenture. Location: Stuttgart, GermanyQCs’ potential to simulate quantum mechanics could be equally transformative in other chemistry-related realms beyond drug development. The auto industry, for example, wants to harness the technology to build better car batteries. In 2018, German car manufacturer (the parent company of Mercedes-Benz) announced two distinct partnerships with quantum-computing powerhouses Google and IBM. Electric vehicles are “mainly based on a well-functioning cell chemistry of the batteries,” in its magazine at the time. Quantum computing, it added, inspires “justified hope” for “initial results” in areas like cellular simulation and the aging of battery cells. Improved batteries for electric vehicles could help increase adoption of those vehicles.Daimler is also looking into how QC could potentially supercharge AI, plus manage an autonomous-vehicle-choked traffic future and accelerate its logistics. It follows in the footsteps of another major Teutonic transportation brand: Volkswagen. In 2017, the automaker announced a partnership with Google focused on similar initiatives. It also teamed up with D-Wave Systems in 2018. Location: Wolfsburg, Germany’s exploration of brings up a point worth emphasizing: Despite some common framing, the main breakthrough of quantum computing isn’t just the speed at which it will solve challenges, but the kinds of challenges it will solve.The “traveling salesman” problem, for instance, is one of the most famous in computation. It aims to determine the shortest possible route between multiple cities, hitting each city once and returning to the starting point. Known as an optimization problem, it’s incredibly difficult for a classical computer to tackle. For fully realized QCs, though, it could be much easier.D-Wave and VW have already run pilot programs on a number of traffic- and travel-related optimization challenges, including streamlining traffic flows in Beijing, Barcelona and Lisbon. For the latter, a fleet of buses traveled along distinct routes that were tailored to real-time traffic conditions through a quantum algorithm, which VW continues to tweak after each trial run. According to D-Wave CEO Vern Brownell, the company’s pilot “brings us closer than ever to realizing true, practical quantum computing.” Location: College Park, MarylandIn the search for sustainable energy alternatives, hydrogen fuel, when produced without the use of fossil fuels, is serving to be a for reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Most hydrogen fuel production is currently rooted in fossil fuel use, though quantum computing could create an efficient avenue to turn this around.Electrolysis, the process of deconstructing water into basal hydrogen and oxygen molecules, can work to extract hydrogen for fuel in an manner. Quantum computing has already been helping research how to utilize electrolysis for the most efficient and sustainable hydrogen production possible. As of 2019, performed the of a water molecule on a quantum device, marking as evidence that computing is able to approach accurate chemical predictions. As of 2022, IonQ released , its newest generation of quantum systems allowing software-configurability and greater flexibility for researchers and other users. There’s hopes that the power of quantum computing can further climate change solution research on a large and accelerated . Location: Boulder, Colorado Quantum computing has become a hot topic amongst the tech industry, though one particular company is keeping it cool. ColdQuanta is known for its use of , in which laser-cooled atoms can act the role as qubits. With this method, fragile atoms can be kept cold while the operating system remains at room temperature, allowing quantum devices to be used in various environments.To aid in research conducted by NASA’s Cold Atom Laboratory, ColdQuanta’s Quantum Core technology was successfully shipped to the International Space Station . The technology has since been expected to be communications, global positioning, and signal processing applications. ColdQuanta has also been signed in multi-million dollar contracts by U.S. government agencies to develop and technologies as of 2021. Great Companies Need Great People. That's Where We Come In.

Menu Published on July 10, 2019 In 8 Ways You Didn’t Know Quantum Technology Is Used In Everyday Lives Researchers and tech giants have been working in the field of quantum physics for over decades now. The quantum technology has enormous potential that brings to life the vision of time travel, unprecedented computing and more. While quantum technology has been explored by researchers for some amazing researches, we list down eight ways where this technology has been used in our everyday lives that often goes unnoticed. 1| Electronic Appliances We have been using quantum techniques in our household needs in the form of electrical appliances such as toasters. When we toast bread in a toaster, we notice the red glow which is because of quantum physics. The heating element emits red colour and the hot objects emit glow are the reasons how quantum physics came into existence. 2| Sensors Everybody loves to capture their precious moments and for this most of us carry a digital camera wherever we go. In digital cameras, the lens collects the photons and focuses them on the sensor which in turn emits electrons through the manipulation of energy levels in semiconductors. The rules of semiconductors are dictated by quantum physics, bringing a second use case of quantum technology. 3| Computers Computers are being widely used for many years and the interesting part about computers is that it solely works on the principle of quantum technology. The basic element inside a computer is known as a transistor which utilises the basic electronic properties of Silicon. It is known to all that Silicon is a semiconductor and the theory of solid-state physics is based on the foundation of quantum mechanics. Electrons in semiconducting solids behave like a wave, thus every computer in this world uses quantum mechanics. 4| Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) Light Emitting Diode is a light source which is based on two layers of semiconductors which contain electrons and holes. We have already mentioned that semiconductors work on the principle of quantum physics. When an LED is connected to a battery, the two layers of semiconductor meet and releases energy in the form of bright light. Thus we are using the quantum technique in the form of a light bulb, television, etc. 5| Incandescent Bulb We have been using the incandescent bulbs for over a hundred years now. The working of this bulb is quite similar to the toasters. When the current passes through a thin wire which is tightly coiled inside the glass bulb, it makes the wire hot and the bulb to glow. This again works on quantum mechanics. 6| Laser A laser is an optical device which has many significant applications in medicines, communications, industries, science and technology, etc. In medicine, it can be used in cancer diagnosis, removing tumours, removing kidney stones, etc. It can also be used in optical fibre communications, space communications, etc. It emits monochromatic light through a method of optical amplification which is based on the stimulated emission of photons, which in turn can be said as the quantum mechanics. 7| GPS GPS or Global Positioning System is a network of satellites that has made finding locations and directions quite easy. The application of GPS is dependent on quantum physics. Each satellite in the GPS constellation includes an ensemble of atomic clocks and these atomic clocks use the principles of quantum theory to measure time. 8| MRI Scans Magnetic Resonance Imaging or MRI works by flipping the spins in the nuclei of hydrogen atoms. This procedure involves the spins of the electrons in hydrogen nuclei and the spins are nothing but an application of quantum physics where special relativity is included with quantum mechanics.

Following this modern branch of physics often leads to delightful (or disturbing, depending on your point of view) speculations about the nature of reality. But just like the rest of us, quantum physics has to get up in the morning, put on its shoes and go to work. Here are a few places quantum physics shows up in your everyday life.Your SmartphoneThough we don’t have fully operational quantum computers quite yet, we wouldn’t have any electronic computers without quantum mechanics. Superposition — the weird property of quantum physics that keeps alive and dead at the same time — is what makes possible the computer you’re using to read this.Thanks to quantum physics, scientists gained an understanding of the dual nature of electrons; namely, that they have properties of both particles and waves. Or as Italian physicist Carlos Rovelli put it in his book Reality Is Not What It Seems, an electron “is diffused in a cloud of probability in all places.”This means an electron can belong to more than one atom at the same time. In fact, an electron can be shared among lots of atoms. (This is how chemical bonds are formed.)Understanding this behavior makes it possible to manipulate the properties of semiconductors, such as silicon. Combining silicon with various other elements to take advantage of their different properties is the basis for creating the tiny transistors inside computers, phones and other electronic devices. In other words, much of what makes the modern world possible.Your Smartphone’s CameraYour phone’s camera also relies on the quantum physics behind semiconductors. The photo detectors or photo diodes in the camera respond to light in the form of a current of electrons. Again, it’s our knowledge of the behavior of electrons that enables us to take advantage of the properties of semiconductors — and the more we understand these properties, the better we can tweak our cameras.So, if you’re continually amazed at the quality of your cell’s photos (and notice that they get better with each phone upgrade), you have the weird behavior of quantum particles to thank.Your ClockYou might have gained an hour of sleep when daylight savings time changed to standard time, but you probably didn’t have to remember to reset your clocks on your phone and computer. That’s because the clocks on our electronic devices get the correct time from atomic clocks, which utilize one of the properties of the quantum world.Like the pendulum in an old-fashioned grandfather clock, the frequency of transitions between two energy states in a cesium-133 atom tick back and forth. Because these oscillations are extremely regular, they provide a very accurate way to keep time. Making use of this fact of nature requires an understanding of quantum physics.GPS uses this super-accurate timekeeping as well: Satellites have very accurate clocks that continually broadcast their time, and your GPS device can figure out where on Earth it is by noting how long it takes satellite signals to reach it.So, yes, quantum physics is weird.

Suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of physics, the well-written, clear, and rigorous text was written by two of the nation's leading authorities on quantum physics. A solid foundation in quantum mechanics and atomic physics is assumed.Early chapters provide background in the mathematical treatment and particular properties of ordinary wave motion that also apply to particle motion. The close relation of quantum theory to physical optics is stressed. Subsequent sections emphasize the physical consequences of a wave theory of material properties, and they offer extensive applications in atomic physics, nuclear physics, solid state physics, and diatomic molecules.

These more recent proposals make extensive use of quantum technologies, from atomic clocks to weak force sensors. Deploying any technology into space pushes specifications to the limit and this will be especially true for quantum-enabled technologies. Recent advances in space technology as developed for experiments such as LISA and LISA Pathfinder have allowed researchers to optimally harness the space environment for quantum experiments.This thematic series is dedicated to all aspects of space-based quantum technologies from fundamental physics to quantum communication protocols including proposals for new space-based quantum experiments as well as terrestrial experimental tests of new quantum technologies for space deployment.

This research topic deals with applications of quantum mechanical techniques to areas outside of quantum mechanics. Research in this area has grown over the last 15 years. But even already more than 50 years ago, the interaction between Physics Nobelist Pauli and the psychologist Carl Jung in the 1950's on seeking to find analogous uses of the complementarity principle from quantum mechanics in psychology needs noting. This research topic does NOT want to advance that society is quantum mechanical! The macroscopic world is manifestly not quantum mechanical. But this rules not out that one can use concepts from physics in a macroscopic environment. A mainstay ingredient of quantum mechanics, is 'quantum probability' and this tool has been proven to be useful in the mathematical modelling of decision making. In the most basic experiment of quantum physics, the double slit experiment, it is known that the law of total probability is violated. It is now well documented that several decision making paradoxes in psychology and economics (such as the Ellsberg paradox) do exhibit this violation of the law of total probability. When data is collected with experiments which test 'non-rational' decision making behaviour, one can observe that such data often exhibits a complex non-commutative structure, which may be quite more complex than if one considers the structure allied to the basic two slit experiment. The quantum mechanics community has tried to address how quantum probability can help in better explaining those paradoxes. Research has now been published in very high standing journals on resolving some of the paradoxes with the mathematics of quantum physics. The aim of this research topic is not only to attract work in the fields described above, but also in other areas such as finance and political science. We are also quite interested in considering work which employs open quantum systems. The topic editors strongly believe that the papers collected under this research topic will form the impetus for more promising research in the future.

Because of quantum mechanics, their positions are described by probabilities that they are in a certain location. These figures describe the probability for electrons in various configurations in a hydrogen atom. This work has been released into the public domain by its author, PoorLeno at English Wikipedia. This applies worldwide. Quantum mechanics is the field of physics that explains how extremely small objects simultaneously have the characteristics of both particles (tiny pieces of matter) and waves (a disturbance or variation that transfers energy). Physicists call this the “wave-particle duality.” The particle portion of the wave-particle duality involves how objects can be described as “quanta.” A quanta is the smallest discrete unit (such as a particle) of a natural phenomenon in a system where the units are in a bound state. For example, a quanta of electromagnetic radiation, or light, is a photon. A bound state is one where the particles are trapped. One example of a bound state is the electrons, neutrons, and protons that are in an atom. To be “quantized” means the particles in a bound state can only have discrete values for properties such as energy or momentum. For example, an electron in an atom can only have very specific energy levels. This is different from our world of macroscopic particles, where these properties can be any value in a range. A baseball can have essentially any energy as it is thrown, travels through the air, gradually slows down, then stops. At the same time, tiny quantized particles such as electrons can also be described as waves. Like a wave in the ocean in our macroscopic world – the world we can see with our eyes -- waves in the quantum world are constantly shifting. In quantum mechanics, scientists talk about a particle’s “wave function.” This is a mathematical representation used to describe the probability that a particle exists at a certain location at a certain time with a certain momentum. The world of quantum mechanics is very different from how we usually see our macroscopic world, which is controlled by what physicists call classical mechanics. Quantum mechanics grew out of the tremendous progress that physicists made in the early 20th century toward understanding the microscopic world around us and how it differed from the macroscopic world. As with many things in science, new discoveries prompted new questions. Prior to this time, scientists thought that light existed as an electromagnetic wave and that electrons existed as discrete, point-like particles. However, this created problems in explaining various phenomena in physics. These include blackbody radiation—the emission of light from objects based on their temperature. Quantum mechanics also helped explain the structure of the atom. It helped make sense of the photoelectric effect, which involves how materials emit electrons when those materials are hit with light of certain wavelengths. By explaining how things can be both particles and waves, quantum mechanics solved these problems. This new knowledge had profound effects in science and technology. Quantum mechanics led to the development of things like lasers, light-emitting diodes, transistors, medical imaging, electron microscopes, and a host of other modern devices. Your cell phone would not exist without the science of quantum mechanics! DOE Office of Science: Contributions to Quantum Mechanics The Department of Energy Office of Science supports research in technology and science resulting from quantum mechanics. The Office of Science has many programs involved with quantum computing and quantum information science. In addition, modern scientific research supported by the Office of Science takes place within the framework of quantum mechanics. facilities such as the Argonne Tandem Linac Accelerator System (ATLAS) at Argonne National Laboratory, Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility’s Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility all exist to study the properties of the smallest particles of nature. These tiny particles are controlled by the rules of quantum mechanics. Other facilities that study the quantized nature of particles include Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the core U.S. particle physics lab. The Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University exists to study the properties of exotic atomic nuclei. Fast Facts Many subatomic particles, including the proton, have angular momentum, which is often referred to as “spin.” Medical experts use this property in MRI imaging devices. Smartphones contain billions of transistors that work based on the wave nature of electrons, which scientists understand through quantum mechanics. and are new applications of quantum mechanics that use the quantized nature of particles to store and transfer information.

Understanding these properties is critical in designing and developing quantum computers and other applications, which differs significantly from the classical systems in use today. Ideally, quantum computers have the potential to deliver higher speeds and processing power than today’s powerful classical computers when solving complex problems in science and other critical applications. Although several technology companies and institutions have developed prototype quantum systems that outperform classical models, they require more research to produce practical and commercially viable products. That said, a wide range of quantum experiments are ongoing, and the arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) is playing a major role. Done well, quantum-based products such as computers, sensors, and others can help to address a wide range of technological challenges and solve complex industrial and scientific problems. Quantum Bits A quantum bit or qubit is the mechanical equivalent of the classical bit (binary digit) in standard computing systems. However, unlike conventional computers where the bit can only be a logical one or zero, the qubit has three possible states, the usual one and zero, and an additional in which the one and zero are active simultaneously. Additionally, the quantum bits have several unique and superior properties that enable them to provide more opportunities and the ability to tackle complex problems better than classical computers. In particular, superposition, entanglement, and interference concepts provide further enhancement that significantly increases the computing power and accuracy of the systems. At the superposition state, the qubit performs two calculations simultaneously - hence increasing the processing speed by two. Additionally, quantum entanglement allows computers to use dozens of linked qubits to solve complex problems that classical computers cannot. The computational power and speed of quantum processors increase exponentially with the number of qubits, unlike classical computers where change is linear. As such, quantum computers can provide higher processing powers that surpass by far even today’s most powerful computers. Theoretically, quantum physics and computing provides an attractive array of potential applications that would solve challenges current systems are incapable of addressing. However, leveraging this power and perform logical operations requires developing technologies to control and manipulate the qubit’s states. As quantum computing advances, more and more companies are performing a wide range of studies and experiments as they develop innovative solutions. Quantum theories and experiments The quantum mechanics theory has conceptual and mathematical aspects and has been instrumental in explaining and predicting a wide range of atomic and subatomic properties. In particular, the state of a quantum particle is indeterminate, and its exact position depends on the time of measurement. Generally, the superposition state can take any possible phase value between 0 and 360 degrees. Generally, a thorough understanding, experiments, and proof of concepts are critical in developing quantum-based products. To study the properties of these objects, which are invisible to the naked eye, researchers often rely on , such as arbitrary waveform generators, transmitters, receivers, advanced processing systems, and more. Usually, validating most of the physics theories involves carrying out various experiments to find out how components or materials behave under certain natural and artificial conditions. However, natural conditions may not always be available during the test time. Luckily, researchers can use signal generators to produce to mimic the expected or natural conditions. As the companies compete to lead in the quantum revolution, they require reliable test, measurement, and analysis equipment. Accurate results are paramount in ensuring that the researchers provide reliable products. In practice, controlling the quantum bits or carrying out the qubit measurements requires specially defined signals such as arbitrary waveforms. Towards this, technology providers have built supporting technologies that enable researchers to detect and manipulate or control quantum objects. To simulate known, complex, and unknown signals, researchers rely on arbitrary wave generators. Once the equipment generates the required waveform, they feed it to the prototype for analysis or manipulation. Afterward, the effect of such a signal is analyzed and the outcome assessed. Role of Arbitrary waveform Generators in quantum physics An Arbitrary waveform Generators (AWG) is a signal source that can generate almost any type of waveform based on the defined wave points and properties such as desired voltage levels at specific times. Once set, the output will follow the set voltages levels at specified times and can thus jump from one desired point to the other. Although similar to the standard function generators, the AWGs offer a higher level of control and flexibility in the waveform definition and generation. For most applications, the function generators are adequate since they can provide the standard waveforms such as sine, square, and triangle. However, the scientific, communication, medical, aerospace, astronomy, and other critical applications require complex waveforms beyond what a functional generator provides. And the arbitrary waveform generators are best suited for these applications since they can produce a variety of signal types, hence enable a wide range of tests. Generally, the AWG differs from the functional signal generator in that it allows users to define the type of output waveform. Typical waveforms can take different forms. Some are repetitive, while others are single-shots and produced by internal or external trigger signals. The ability to control the instrument to provide almost any complex waveform makes it ideal test equipment. Additionally, their sampling rates, high output signal quality, analog bandwidths, and other features make them suitable for RF applications, where they can replace some of the traditional RF generators. Function generators, for example, have limitations such as only a few types of waveforms they can produce, narrow frequency range, supports only a few outputs, etc. Most often, the AWGs will only generate arbitrary waveforms. However, some models combine both the arbitrary and functional generator options, hence capable of also producing the sine, square, triangle, and other standard waveforms. In a typical experiment, researchers often inject the AWG signal into the system or device under test (DUT). They then analyze the waveform as it passes through the DUT, and this allows them to prove if their theory is working practically. Besides the generation, advanced quantum measurement instruments such as Arbitrary Waveform Transceivers provide various inbuilt functions that reduces the number of external components and integrations. Consequently, this reduces a wide range of interconnection and integrations issues such as noise, coupling, incompatibilities, and other challenges that impact the accuracy of the results. Choosing an Arbitrary waveform Generator Ideally, the AWG provides the necessary signals, however complex to test and validate new products and systems in development. Today, there is a wide range of AWG products, and these may differ in terms of accuracy, resolution, bandwidth, output ports, and more. While the AWG design differs in architecture and performance, there are some basic features that a good product should have. Choosing the right instrument is critical in ensuring the accuracy and success of the tests. The basic building blocks of an AWG include a clock generator, a digital to analog convertor (DAC), a low pass filter and the output amplifier. It also has a processor, memory, a sequencer and an external trigger system. In a typical generation process, a waveform sample from memory flows into the DAC, then to a filter. Afterwards the conditioned signal is amplified and available at the output as an analog waveform. That said, there are some essential features or capabilities to consider when looking for an . include, but not limited to the sampling rate, waveform memory capacity, resolution, number of channels and form factor.. Additionally, the closed loop feedback, output, and integration options play a critical role in quantum measurements. Typical quantum measurements or validation tests would include a waveform generator, the DUT, and analysis equipment. Integrating such equipment is prone to coupling and interconnections issues that may reduce the accuracy of measurements. Until recently, researchers had no option, but to combine at least two or three pieces of test equipment to conduct a quantum measurement. However, over time some instrumentation companies are building equipment that combines multiple functions into one unit. Consequently, this eliminates the need to use several test equipment hence reducing errors and other challenges. Some instruments such as the Arbitrary Waveform Transceivers (AWTs) come with an AWG for signal generation as well as acquisition and processing systems. To manage the generation, transmission and receiving functionalities, the AWTs have complete inbuilt control systems, digitizers, up and down converters, mixers and feedback loops. Today, some advanced instruments such as the combines an AWG RF generator and transceiver functions. Such equipment can transmit, receive and process arbitrary signals, thereby eliminating the need for additional instruments. Other than saving on space, the single unit is easier and quicker to setup, more efficient and cost-effective. Additionally, eliminating the interconnections reduces the errors and other issues that would impact on accuracy. Conclusion Quantum computing, sensing, and other applications based on quantum physics have the potential to provide solutions to a wide range of challenges. Theoretically, quantum computers should be powerful than transistor-based supercomputers. However, scientists and researchers are yet to develop commercial computers that would outperform existing systems. Towards this, technology companies, research institutions, and governments are today committing a substantial amount of their efforts and resources to quantum physics studies. However, quantum theories and practices are complex areas that require advanced testing, experiments, and analysis to validate the products in development. The very nature of complex signals and waveforms requires special instrumentation tools with features beyond the usual functional generators and associated accessories. In particular, the researchers need the right tools to perform a wide range of quantum experiments with all the possible types of signals. Finally, they need other supporting technologies and means to control and analyze the quantum bits. Visitor Information Product Catalogues Copyright © 1971 - 2021 Tabor Electronics Ltd.

Ⓒ 2023 Dotdash Media, Inc. — All rights reserved Types and Function of White Blood Cells (WBCs) By Updated on September 19, 2022 Medically reviewed by Print Table of Contents View All Table of Contents White blood cells (WBCs) are a part of the immune system. They help fight infection and defend the body against other foreign materials. Different types of white blood cells have different jobs. Some are involved in recognizing intruders. Some kill harmful bacteria. Others make antibodies to protect your body against exposure to bacteria and viruses. This article discusses the different types of white blood cells and their various functions. Types of WBC White blood cells are are also known as leukocytes. They are the body's defense against infections. There are several different types with different purposes. Some of the cells are part of our innate immune system, meaning they know from birth to attack foreigners. Others are part of our humoral or learned immune system. Humoral immune cells manufacture antibodies after exposure to a germ. This way, the body can be prepared for another attack by that germ. Verywell / Ellen Lindner Neutrophils make up roughly half of the white blood cell population. They are usually the first cells of the immune system to respond to invaders such as bacteria or viruses. As first responders, they also send out signals alerting other cells in the immune system to come to the scene. Neutrophils are the main cells found in pus. Once released from the bone marrow, these cells live for only around eight hours. Your body produces roughly 100 billion of these cells every day. Eosinophils also play a role in fighting off bacteria. They are very important in responding to parasitic infections (such as worms) as well. They are perhaps best known for their role in triggering allergy symptoms. Eosinophils can go overboard in mounting an immune response against something harmless. For example, eosinophils mistake pollen for a foreign invader. Eosinophils account for no more than 5% of the white blood cells in your bloodstream. However, there are high concentrations of eosinophils in the digestive tract. Basophils Basophils account for only around 1% of white blood cells. These cells are perhaps best known for their role in asthma. However, they are important in mounting a non-specific immune response to pathogens, organisms that can cause disease. When stimulated, these cells release histamine, among other chemicals. This can result in inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Lymphocytes (B and T) are also essential in the immune system. They come in two forms: B cells and T cells. Unlike other white blood cells that provide non-specific immunity, B and T cells have specific purposes. are responsible for humoral immunity, which is the immune response that involves antibodies. B cells produce the antibodies that ""remember"" an infection. They stand ready in case your body is exposed to that pathogen again. T cells recognize specific foreign invaders and are responsible for directly killing them. ""Memory"" T cells also remember an invader after an infection and respond quickly if it is seen again. B lymphocytes play a key role in the effectiveness of many current vaccines. In some cases, such as tuberculosis and pertussis vaccines, T lymphocytes are the main players. Monocytes are the garbage trucks of the immune system. Around 5% to 12% of white blood cells in your bloodstream are monocytes. Their most important function is to clean up dead cells in the body. Recap Leukocytes, better known as white blood cells, take on different forms that perform different roles in the immune system. These include: Neutrophils are the first responder of immune cells.Basophils release histamine to mount a non-specific immune response.Eosinophils fight bacteria and parasites but also provoke allergy symptoms.Lymphocytes are B and T cells that defend against specific invaders.Monocytes clean up dead cells. How WBCs Are Formed White blood cells begin in the bone marrow in a process called hematopoiesis. All blood cells descend from a common hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). This is also called a ""pluripotent"" stem cell. These stem cells differentiate—or specialize—in different stages. The HSC cell first separates into either a lymphoid or myeloid stem cell. The lymphoid stem cell gives rise to the lymphoid cell line. This is the family of cells that produces B cells and T cells. The myeloid stem cells give rise to cells called myeloblasts. These further evolve into macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. Myeloblasts can also turn into red blood cells and platelets. Lab Values A normal white blood cell count is usually between 4,000 and 10,000 cells per microliter (mcL).﻿﻿ Elevated White Blood Cell Counts Infections usually cause an elevated white blood cell count, but there are also other possible causes. WBC counts can be increased by overproduction. In other words, the body may release white blood cells early from the bone marrow. Stress of any form can result in this release of white blood cells. Some causes of an increased white blood cell count include: Infections Cancers such as , , and , in which a greater number of white blood cells are manufactured Inflammation, such as and Trauma, ranging from fractures to emotional stress Pregnancy Asthma and allergies Exercise In severe infections, white blood cells called blasts may be present. Blasts often appear when the body attempts to get white blood cells on the scene quickly. Low White Blood Cell Counts Conditions that may result in a include: Severe infections Bone marrow damage or disorders including , bone marrow ""takeover"" by blood cancers or metastatic cancer, or drug or chemical-related damage to the bone marrow Autoimmune diseases such as Splenic ""sequestration,"" where white blood cells are accumulated in the spleen. Symptoms On its own, a low WBC count doesn't have symptoms. But a low count will often lead to an infection, because not enough white cells are present to fight off the invader. Symptoms of infection may include: FeverCoughPainful or frequent urinationBlood in the stoolsDiarrheaRedness, swelling, or warmth in a region of infection Chemotherapy One of chemotherapy's most common and dangerous side effects is its effect on white blood cells known as neutrophils. Recall that neutrophils are the first responders of our immune system. A decrease in neutrophils during chemotherapy, known as , increases the risk of serious infection. Neutropenia makes it more difficult for the body to fight off infections. As a result, bacteria that are normally not very harmful can cause serious illness. Summary White blood cells are an important part of our immune system. Different types of white blood cells perform different functions in the body. Overall, white blood cells help to protect us against bacteria, viruses, and parasites. is usually a sign of an infection or illness. A low white blood cell count can indicate another type of problem. Low white blood cell counts can leave you vulnerable to serious infections. Chemotherapy is a common cause of low white blood cell counts. Frequently Asked Questions What is the normal range of white blood cells? The normal range (total) of white blood cells is between 4,000 and 10,000 cells per microliter (mcL). What causes a high number of lymphocytes? A high number of lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) can be caused by the body's immune system fighting against infection. In these cases, the elevated number of lymphocytes is temporary. However, lymphocytosis can also be caused by several underlying medical conditions, including leukemia. How many types of white blood cells are there? There are five types of white blood cells (leukocytes):NeutrophilsLymphocytes (B and T)MonocytesBasophilsEosinophils What does a high WBC mean? A high white blood count (WBC) can be a symptom of an underlying disorder. Disorders that are related to a high WBC include autoimmune or inflammatory disease, bacterial or viral infection, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, or allergic reaction. What are the symptoms of eosinophilia? Eosinophilia symptoms can include fever, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss. This condition is caused by the body producing an excessive number of eosinophils, a type of leukocyte (white blood cell). Where are white blood cells made? White blood cells are made in the bone marrow. 13 Sources Verywell Health uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

In addition to the irregularly shaped leukocytes, both and many small disc-shaped are visible.DetailsIdentifiersAcronym(s)WBC[] White blood cells, also called leukocytes or leucocytes, are cells of the immune system that are involved in protecting the body against both infectious disease and foreign invaders. White blood cells include three main subtypes; granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes. White cells is most preferred rather than the, white blood cells, because, they spend most of their time in the lymph or plasma. All white blood cells are produced and derived from cells in the known as . Leukocytes are found throughout the body, including the and . All white blood cells have , which distinguishes them from the other , the anucleated (RBCs) and . They are white in color, or colorless, due to lack of haemoglobin in them. They are devoid of any shape and can be termed as amoeboid. The different white blood cells are usually classified by lineage ( or ). White blood cells are part of the body's immune system. They help the body fight and other diseases. Types of white blood cells are granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), and agranulocytes (, and (T cells and B cells)). Myeloid cells () include , , , , and . Monocytes are further subdivided into and . Monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils are . Lymphoid cells () include (subdivided into , , ), (subdivided into and ), and . Historically, white blood cells were classified by their physical characteristics ( and ), but this classification system is less frequently used now. Produced in the , white blood cells defend the body against and . An excess of white blood cells is usually due to infection or inflammation. Less commonly, a high white blood cell count could indicate certain blood cancers or bone marrow disorders. The number of leukocytes in the blood is often an indicator of , and thus the white blood cell count is an important subset of the . The normal white cell count between 4 × 109/L and 1.1 × 1010/L. In the US, this is usually expressed as 4,000 to 11,000 white blood cells per microliter of blood. White blood cells make up approximately 1% of the total blood volume in a healthy adult, making them substantially less numerous than the . However, this 1% of the blood makes a large difference to health, because depends on it. An increase in the number of leukocytes over the is called . It is normal when it is part of healthy immune responses, which happen frequently. It is occasionally abnormal, when it is or in origin. A decrease below the lower limit is called . This indicates a weakened immune system. Etymology[] The name ""white blood cell"" derives from the physical appearance of a blood sample after . White cells are found in the , a thin, typically white layer of nucleated cells between the sedimented and the . The scientific term leukocyte directly reflects its description. It is derived from the roots - meaning ""white"" and - meaning ""cell"". The may sometimes be green if there are large amounts of in the sample, due to the -containing enzyme that they produce. Types of white blood cells[] Overview[] 3D rendering of various types of white blood cells All white blood cells are nucleated, which distinguishes them from the anucleated red blood cells and platelets. Types of leukocytes can be classified in standard ways. Two pairs of broadest categories classify them either by structure ( or ) or by cell lineage (myeloid cells or lymphoid cells). These broadest categories can be further divided into the five main types: , , , , and . These types are distinguished by their physical and functional characteristics. Monocytes and neutrophils are . Further subtypes can be classified. Granulocytes are distinguished from agranulocytes by their nucleus shape (lobed versus round, that is, polymorphonuclear versus mononuclear) and by their cytoplasm (present or absent, or more precisely, visible on light microscopy or not thus visible). The other dichotomy is by lineage: Myeloid cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils) are distinguished from lymphoid cells (lymphocytes) by lineage ( lineage). Lymphocytes can be further classified as T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells.

Kidney shaped None Hours to days Neutrophil[] Main article: Neutrophil engulfing Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell, constituting 60-70% of the circulating leukocytes. They defend against or infection. They are usually first responders to microbial infection; their activity and death in large numbers form . They are commonly referred to as polymorphonuclear (PMN) leukocytes, although, in the technical sense, PMN refers to all granulocytes. They have a multi-lobed nucleus, which consists of three to five lobes connected by slender strands. This gives the neutrophils the appearance of having multiple nuclei, hence the name polymorphonuclear leukocyte. The cytoplasm may look transparent because of fine granules that are pale lilac when stained. Neutrophils are active in phagocytosing bacteria and are present in large amount in the pus of wounds. These cells are not able to renew their (used in digesting microbes) and die after having phagocytosed a few pathogens. Neutrophils are the most common cell type seen in the early stages of acute inflammation. The average lifespan of inactivated human neutrophils in the circulation has been reported by different approaches to be between 5 and 135 hours. Eosinophil[] Main article: Eosinophils compose about 2-4% of white blood cells in circulating blood. This count fluctuates throughout the day, seasonally, and during . It rises in response to allergies, parasitic infections, collagen diseases, and disease of the spleen and central nervous system. They are rare in the blood, but numerous in the mucous membranes of the respiratory, digestive, and lower urinary tracts. They primarily deal with infections. Eosinophils are also the predominant inflammatory cells in allergic reactions. The most important causes of eosinophilia include allergies such as asthma, hay fever, and hives; and parasitic infections. They secrete chemicals that destroy large parasites, such as hookworms and tapeworms, that are too big for any one white blood cell to phagocytize. In general, their nuclei are bi-lobed. The lobes are connected by a thin strand. The cytoplasm is full of granules that assume a characteristic pink-orange color with staining. Basophil[] The movement of leukocytes in the blood. Phase-contrast microscopy. Main article: Basophils are chiefly responsible for and response by releasing the chemical causing the . Because they are the rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study. They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, but it is hard to see because of the number of coarse granules that hide it. They secrete two chemicals that aid in the body's defenses: and . Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue. It also makes blood vessels more permeable so neutrophils and clotting proteins can get into connective tissue more easily. Heparin is an anticoagulant that inhibits blood clotting and promotes the movement of white blood cells into an area. Basophils can also release chemical signals that attract eosinophils and neutrophils to an infection site. Lymphocyte[] Main article: Lymphocytes are much more common in the lymphatic system than in blood. Lymphocytes are distinguished by having a deeply staining nucleus that may be eccentric in location, and a relatively small amount of cytoplasm. Lymphocytes include: make that can bind to , block pathogen invasion, activate the , and enhance pathogen destruction. : + : T cells displaying are known as CD4+ T cells. These cells have and CD4 molecules that, in combination, bind presented on molecules on . Helper T cells make and perform other functions that help coordinate the . In infection, these T cells are the main index to identify the individual's immune system integrity. + : T cells displaying co-receptor are known as CD8+ T cells. These cells bind antigens presented on complex of virus-infected or tumour cells and kill them. Nearly all nucleated cells display MHC I. possess an alternative (different from the αβ TCR found on conventional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells). Found in tissue more commonly than in blood, γδ T cells share characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and natural killer cells. are able to kill cells of the body that do not display molecules, or display stress markers such as (MIC-A). Decreased expression of MHC class I and up-regulation of MIC-A can happen when cells are infected by a virus or become cancerous. Monocyte[] Main article: Monocytes, the largest type of white blood cell, share the ""vacuum cleaner"" () function of neutrophils, but are much longer lived as they have an extra role: they present pieces of to T cells so that the pathogens may be recognized again and killed. This causes an antibody response to be mounted. Monocytes eventually leave the bloodstream and become tissue , which remove dead cell debris as well as attack microorganisms. Neither dead cell debris nor attacking microorganisms can be dealt with effectively by the neutrophils. Unlike neutrophils, monocytes are able to replace their contents and are thought to have a much longer active life. They have the kidney-shaped nucleus and are typically not granulated. They also possess abundant cytoplasm. Fixed leucocytes[] HSC=, Progenitor=, L-blast=, , Mo-blast=, , , Pro-M=, , Meta-M=, , , , Pro-E=, Baso-E=, poly-E=, Ortho-E=, , , , Some leucocytes migrate into the tissues of the body to take up a permanent residence at that location rather than remaining in the blood. Often these cells have specific names depending upon which tissue they settle in, such as fixed macrophages in the liver, which become known as . These cells still serve a role in the immune system. (Although these will often migrate to local lymph nodes upon ingesting antigens) Disorders[] The two commonly used categories of white blood cell disorders divide them into those causing excessive numbers ( disorders) and those causing insufficient numbers (). is usually healthy (e.g., fighting an ), but it also may be dysfunctionally proliferative. Proliferative disorders of white blood cells can be classed as and . Some are , but many are . Another way to categorize disorders of white blood cells is . There are various disorders in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally. Neoplasia of white blood cells can be but is often . Of the various , of white blood cells can be broadly classified as and , although those categories overlap and are often grouped together. Leukopenias[] Main article: A range of disorders can cause decreases in white blood cells. This type of white blood cell decreased is usually the neutrophil. In this case the decrease may be called or granulocytopenia. Less commonly, a decrease in lymphocytes (called or lymphopenia) may be seen. Leukemia[] Main article: A range of disorder, in which, the count of white blood cells increases abnormally. It is type of cancer. It can be preferrably cured by the bone marrow transplantation, because, white blood cells are produced from bone marrow, therefore, transplating the right person's bone marrow, can cure this disease. Neutropenia[] Main article: can be or . A decrease in levels of neutrophils on lab tests is due to either decreased production of neutrophils or increased removal from the blood. The following list of causes is not complete. Medications - , sulfas or other , phenothiazines, , antithyroid medications, , quinine, quinidine, indomethacin, procainamide, thiazides Radiation Toxins - , benzenes Intrinsic disorders - , , cyclic neutropenia, Immune dysfunction - disorders of collagen, , Blood cell dysfunction - , , marrow failure, marrow replacement, acute Any major infection Miscellaneous - , Symptoms of neutropenia are associated with the underlying cause of the decrease in neutrophils. For example, the most common cause of acquired neutropenia is drug-induced, so an individual may have symptoms of or toxicity. Treatment is also aimed at the underlying cause of the neutropenia. One severe consequence of neutropenia is that it can increase the risk of infection. Lymphocytopenia[] Main article: Defined as total lymphocyte count below 1.0x109/L, the cells most commonly affected are CD4+ T cells. Like neutropenia, lymphocytopenia may be acquired or intrinsic and there are many causes. This is not a complete list. Inherited immune deficiency - , , , , immunodeficiency with short-limbed dwarfism, immunodeficiency with thymoma, , genetic polymorphism Blood cell dysfunction - Infectious diseases - (, , , , , , others), (, , , , , ), (acute phase of ) Medications - chemotherapy (antilymphocyte globulin therapy, , ) Radiation Major surgery Miscellaneous - , kidney or , , , severe burns, , severe acute , , , strenuous exercise, Immune dysfunction - , , , , , -like syndrome, , Nutritional/Dietary - , Like neutropenia, symptoms and treatment of lymphocytopenia are directed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts. Proliferative disorders[] Main article: An increase in the number of white blood cells in is called . This increase is most commonly caused by . There are four major causes: increase of production in bone marrow, increased release from storage in bone marrow, decreased attachment to veins and arteries, decreased uptake by tissues. Leukocytosis may affect one or more cell lines and can be neutrophilic, eosinophilic, basophilic, monocytosis, or lymphocytosis. Neutrophilia[] Main article: Neutrophilia is an increase in the absolute neutrophil count in the . Normal blood values vary by age. Neutrophilia can be caused by a direct problem with blood cells (primary disease). It can also occur as a consequence of an underlying disease (secondary). Most cases of neutrophilia are secondary to inflammation. Primary causes Conditions with normally functioning neutrophils – neutrophilia, chronic neutrophilia ( and other Secondary causes Chronic – especially , , , , , infections (for example, ), and chronic – occurs in 25–50% of chronic smokers and can last up to 5 years after quitting Stress – exercise, surgery, general stress Medication induced – (for example, , β-agonists, ) Cancer – either by secreted by the tumor or invasion of bone marrow by the cancer Increased destruction of cells in can stimulate bone marrow. This can occur in and Eosinophilia[] Main article: A normal eosinophil count is considered to be less than 0.65×109/L. Eosinophil counts are higher in newborns and vary with age, time (lower in the morning and higher at night), exercise, environment, and exposure to allergens. Eosinophilia is never a normal lab finding. Efforts should always be made to discover the underlying cause, though the cause may not always be found. Counting and reference ranges[] Main article: The is a that includes the overall white blood cell count and count, a count of each type of white blood cell. specify the typical counts in healthy people. The normal total leucocyte count in an adult is 4000 to 11,000 per mm3 of blood. Differential leucocyte count: number/ (%) of different types of leucocytes per cubic mm. of blood.

A white blood cell, also known as a leukocyte or white corpuscle, is a cellular component of the that lacks , has a , is capable of motility, and defends the body against infection and disease. White blood cells carry out their defense activities by ingesting foreign materials and cellular debris, by destroying infectious agents and cancer cells, or by producing . Although white cells are found in the circulation, most occur outside the circulation, within tissues, where they fight infections; the few in the bloodstream are in transit from one site to another. White cells are highly differentiated for their specialized functions, and they do not undergo cell division () in the bloodstream; however, some retain the capability of mitosis. What are the major classes of white blood cells? On the basis of their appearance under a light microscope, white cells are grouped into three major classes—, , and monocytes—each of which carries out somewhat different functions. Lymphocytes, which are further divided into B cells and T cells, are responsible for the specific recognition of foreign agents and their subsequent removal from the host. Granulocytes, the most numerous of the white cells, rid the body of large pathogenic organisms such as or helminths and are also key mediators of allergy and other forms of inflammation. Monocytes, which constitute between 4 and 8 percent of the total number of white blood cells in the blood, move from the blood to sites of infection, where they differentiate further into macrophages. What is a healthy white blood cell count? A healthy adult human has between 4,500 and 11,000 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood. Fluctuations in white cell number occur during the day; lower values are obtained during rest and higher values during exercise. An abnormal increase in the number of white cells is known as , whereas an abnormal decrease in number is known as . White cell count may increase in response to intense physical exertion, convulsions, acute emotional reactions, pain, pregnancy, labour, and certain disease states, such as infections and intoxications. The count may decrease in response to certain types of infections or drugs or in association with certain conditions, such as chronic anemia, malnutrition, or anaphylaxis. In general, newborns have a high white blood cell count that gradually falls to the adult level during childhood. white blood cell, also called leukocyte or white corpuscle, a cellular component of the that lacks , has a , is capable of motility, and defends the body against infection and by ingesting foreign materials and cellular , by destroying infectious agents and cells, or by producing . Characteristics of white blood cells In adults, the produces 60 to 70 percent of the white cells (i.e., the granulocytes). The lymphatic tissues, particularly the thymus, the spleen, and the lymph nodes, produce the lymphocytes (comprising 20 to 30 percent of the white cells). The reticuloendothelial tissues of the , liver, nodes, and other organs produce the monocytes (4 to 8 percent of the white cells). A healthy adult human has between 4,500 and 11,000 white blood cells per cubic millimetre of blood. Fluctuations in white number occur during the day; lower are obtained during rest and higher values during . The survival of white blood cells, as living cells, depends on their continuous production of energy. The chemical pathways utilized are more complex than those of the red cells and are similar to those of other cells. White cells, containing a nucleus and able to produce ribonucleic acid (RNA), can synthesize protein. Although white cells are found in the , most occur outside the circulation, within tissues, where they fight infections; the few in the bloodstream are in transit from one site to another.

Major classes of white blood cells , which are further divided into and , are responsible for the specific recognition of foreign agents and their subsequent removal from the host. secrete antibodies, which are proteins that bind to foreign microorganisms in body tissues and mediate their destruction. Typically, T cells recognize virally infected or cancerous cells and destroy them, or they serve as helper cells to assist the production of by B cells. Also included in this group are , so named for their ability to kill a variety of target cells. In a healthy person, about 25 to 33 percent of white blood cells are lymphocytes. , the most numerous of the white cells, rid the body of large pathogenic organisms such as or helminths and are also key mediators of and other forms of . These cells contain many cytoplasmic granules, or secretory vesicles, that harbour potent chemicals important in immune responses. They also have multilobed nuclei, and because of this they are often called polymorphonuclear cells. On the basis of how their granules take up dye in the laboratory, granulocytes are subdivided into three categories: , , and . The most numerous of the granulocytes—making up 50 to 80 percent of all white cells—are neutrophils. They are often one of the first cell types to arrive at a site of infection, where they engulf and destroy the infectious microorganisms through a process called . Eosinophils and basophils, as well as the tissue cells called , typically arrive later. The granules of basophils and of the closely related mast cells contain a number of chemicals, including and leukotrienes, that are important in inducing allergic inflammatory responses.

These cells are scavengers that phagocytose whole or killed microorganisms and are therefore effective at direct destruction of pathogens and cleanup of cellular debris from sites of infection. Neutrophils and macrophages are the main phagocytic cells of the body, but macrophages are much larger and longer-lived than neutrophils. Some macrophages are important as antigen-presenting cells, cells that phagocytose and degrade microbes and present portions of these organisms to T lymphocytes, thereby activating the specific acquired immune response."

White blood cells are immune system cells. They are like warriors waiting in your blood stream to attack invaders such as bacteria and viruses. When fighting an infection, your body produces more white blood cells. For infective organisms to enter the body they must first overcome physical barriers such as the skin, nose hairs, mucus, and stomach acid. Once they have passed this first line of defence they can cause infection. Our second line of defence is then the immune system. There are several types of white blood cells and they have different roles in defending the body against bacterial, viral, fungal and parasitic infections. When they locate an infection, these cells move to the site under attack to destroy the invading pathogen and prevent illness. (Picture: white blood cells) Some directly fight intruders. They are attracted towards the infective agents, then surround and engulf them. Once inside the cell, these white cells then release chemicals that break the organism down and destroy it. Other white cells, called lymphocytes, target attacks in another way, by making antibodies. These cells detect antigens - proteins on the surface of pathogens which are different to the surface markers on the body’s own cells. When lymphocytes identify antigens as not belonging in the body, they produce antibodies against them. This can take a few days, during which time you may feel ill. Antibodies stick to the antigens and make it easier for the other parts of the immune system to identify, destroy and remove infective agents. Memory cells ‘remember’ the antigens from an infection, so that during a second exposure the immune response is faster. White cells respond more quickly, so antibodies are produced sooner, which can stop you from becoming ill again. Lymphocytes can also produce anti-toxins to neutralise toxins released by some pathogens. Antibodies and anti-toxins are highly specific. Different types of white blood cells Vaccines can develop immunity by imitating an infection and stimulating an immune response. The vaccine doesn’t cause illness but sometimes causes minor symptoms as the body builds immunity. Vaccines contain harmless copies of the antigens on the surface of bacteria and viruses. When the immune system detects an antigen, more white bloods cells are produced as well as antibodies. Then if an infection with that infective agent does occur, more antibodies can be produced quickly. White blood cells in the body remember how to fight the disease. White blood cells are also involved in allergic reactions. When they detect an allergen, such as pollen, in the body, they release histamine. This chemical acts on the body’s cells causing effects such as coughing, sneezing and a runny nose. This response is designed to expel the allergen from the body.

Search Encyclopedia What Are White Blood Cells? Your blood is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. Your white blood cells account for only about 1% of your blood, but their impact is big. White blood cells are also called leukocytes. They protect you against illness and disease. Think of white blood cells as your immunity cells. In a sense, they are always at war. They flow through your bloodstream to fight viruses, bacteria, and other foreign invaders that threaten your health. When your body is in distress and a particular area is under attack, white blood cells rush in to help destroy the harmful substance and prevent illness. White blood cells are made in the bone marrow. They are stored in your blood and lymph tissues. Because some white blood cells called neutrophils have a short life less than a day, your bone marrow is always making them. Types of white blood cells Among your white blood cells are: Monocytes. They have a longer lifespan than many white blood cells and help to break down bacteria. Lymphocytes. They create antibodies to fight against bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful invaders. Neutrophils. They kill and digest bacteria and fungi. They are the most numerous type of white blood cell and your first line of defense when infection strikes. Basophils. These small cells seem to sound an alarm when infectious agents invade your blood. They secrete chemicals, such as histamine, a marker of allergic disease, that help control the body's immune response. Eosinophils. They attack and kill parasites and cancer cells, and help with allergic responses. Problems affecting white blood cells Your white blood cell count can be low for a number of reasons. This includes when something is destroying the cells more quickly than the body can replenish them. Or when the bone marrow stops making enough white blood cells to keep you healthy. When your white blood cell count is low, you are at great risk for any illness or infection, which can spiral into a serious health threat. Your healthcare provider can do a blood test to see whether your white blood cell count is normal. If your count is too low or too high, you may have a white blood cell disorder. A number of diseases and conditions may affect white blood cell levels: Weak immune system. This is often caused by illnesses, such as HIV/AIDS, or by cancer treatment. Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy can destroy white blood cells and leave you at risk for infection. Infection. A higher-than-normal white blood cell count usually means you have some type of infection. White blood cells are multiplying to destroy the bacteria or virus. Myelodysplastic syndrome. This condition causes abnormal production of blood cells. This includes white blood cells in the bone marrow. Cancer of the blood. Cancers including leukemia and lymphoma can cause uncontrolled growth of an abnormal type of blood cell in the bone marrow. This results in a greatly increased risk for infection or serious bleeding. Myeloproliferative disorder. This disorder refers to various conditions that trigger the excessive production of immature blood cells. This can result in an unhealthy balance of all types of blood cells in the bone marrow and too many or too few white blood cells in the blood. Medicines. Some medicines can raise or lower the body's white blood cell count. Conditions, such as extreme physical stress caused by an injury or emotional stress, can also trigger high white blood cell levels. So can inflammation, labor or the end of pregnancy, smoking, or even extreme exercise.

Function What do white blood cells do? White blood cells protect your body against infection. As your white blood cells travel through your bloodstream and tissues, they locate the site of an infection and act as an army general to notify other white blood cells of their location to help defend your body from an attack of an unknown organism. Once your white blood cell army arrives, they fight the invader by producing antibody proteins to attach to the organism and destroy it. Anatomy Where are white blood cells located? Your white blood cells are in your bloodstream and travel through blood vessel walls and tissues to locate the site of an infection. What do white blood cells look like? Contrary to their name, white blood cells are colorless but can appear as a very light purple to pink color when examined under a microscope and colored with dye. These extremely tiny cells have a round shape with a distinct center membrane (nucleus). How big are white blood cells? You can only see white blood cells under a microscope, as they are extremely small. How many white blood cells are in my body? White blood cells account for 1% of your blood. There are more red blood cells in your body than white blood cells. How are white blood cells formed? White blood cell formation occurs in the soft tissue inside of your bones (bone marrow). Two types of white blood cells (lymphocytes) grow in the thymus gland (T cells) and lymph nodes and spleen (B cells). What are white blood cells made of? White blood cells originate from cells that morph into other cells in the body (stem cell) within the soft tissue of your bones (bone marrow). What are the types of white blood cells? There are five types of white blood cells: Neutrophils: Help protect your body from infections by killing bacteria, fungi and foreign debris. Lymphocytes: Consist of T cells, natural killer cells and B cells to protect against viral infections and produce proteins to help you fight infection (antibodies). Eosinophils: Identify and destroy parasites, cancer cells and assists basophils with your allergic response. Basophils: Produces an allergic response like coughing, sneezing or a runny nose. Monocytes: Defend against infection by cleaning up damaged cells. Conditions and Disorders What are the common conditions and disorders that affect white blood cells? If you have a , you are likely to get infections (). If your white blood cell count is too high (), you may have an infection or an underlying medical condition like , or an immune disorder. What are common signs or symptoms of white blood cell conditions? Symptoms of white blood cell conditions, where you may have a count that is too high or too low include: Fever, body aches and chills. Wound that is red, swollen, oozes pus or won’t heal. Frequent infections. Persistent cough or difficulty breathing. What is a normal white blood cell count? It is normal for you to produce nearly 100 billion white blood cells each day. After completing a blood draw, a test counts your white blood cells, which equals number of cells per microliter of blood. The normal white blood cell count ranges between 4,000 and 11,000 cells per microliter. What are common tests to check the number of white blood cells? A (CBC) test identifies information about the cells in your blood. A lab completes this test after a medical professional draws your blood and examines your white and red blood cell count. is a test to detect infection or abscesses in your body’s soft tissues. This test involves withdrawing your blood, separating the white blood cells from the sample, tagging them with a radioactive isotope, returning those white blood cells back into your body, then an imaging test will identify areas that show infection or abscess on your body. What causes a low white blood cell count? Causes of low white blood cell count include: Bone marrow failure (). Bone marrow attacked by cancer cells (leukemia). Drug exposure (). (B12). . A blood test with fewer than 4,000 cells per microliter of blood diagnoses low white blood cells. What causes a high white blood cell count? Causes of high white blood cell count include: Autoimmune disorders (, ). Viral infections (tuberculosis, ). Bacterial infections (). Physical injury or stress. Leukemia or . . A blood test with more than 11,000 cells per microliter of blood diagnoses high white blood cells. What are common treatments for white blood cell disorders? Treatment for white blood cell disorders vary based on the diagnosis and severity of the condition. Treatment ranges from: Taking vitamins. Taking antibiotics. Surgery to replace or repair bone marrow. Blood transfusion. Stem cell transplant. Care How do I take care of my white blood cells?

The WBC may be determined quantitatively (automated analyser counts or manual haemocytometer counts) or qualitatively (determination of density with blood smear review). Before quantitative white blood cell determinations, red blood cells are lysed using a hypotonic solution. The resulting preparation contains only white blood cells and platelets. Automated counters measure white blood cells as they flow in single file past a detector. For manual haemocytometer counts, a commercially available diluent system (Unopette©, Becton-Dickinsen, Test 5855) is used to dilute blood and lyse red blood cells prior to counting white blood cells. A qualitative estimation of the WBC can be determined by microscopic evaluation of well-prepared blood smears by a trained observer. The WBC of mice ranges from 2 to 10 × 109/L.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123820082000143Adnan I Qureshi, in , 2016White blood cellsWhite blood cells, also known as leukocytes or leucocytes, are the backbone of the immune system responsible for protecting against all harmful agents that infect the human body. In mid-eighteenth century, William Hewson was among the pioneers to identify white blood cells. He used the term “colorless cells” for white blood cells. He described that the white blood cells are produced in lymphatic system, where from they are transported to the blood circulation via a specialized duct system. He further proposed that, in blood vessels, white blood cells are converted into red blood cells. He used serum instead of water to dilute the blood and further investigate white blood cells.During that time, stains were not yet developed so that he could study white blood cells in more detail. It was not until the nineteenth century, when Paul Ehrlich stained cells using dyes, which helped him to differentiate among various types of blood cells and red cell changes in diseases and also identified the various types of white blood cells. Elie Metchnikoff discovered neutrophils when he pricked starfish larvae with a rose thorn and noticed the accumulation of these cells at the site of injury.Generally, the mode of transmission for Ebola virus is direct contact with skin or body fluids of infected human or animal. White blood cells respond by releasing large amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. If leukocytes are considered police officers, proinflammatory cytokines will be the bullets used to stop the perpetrator virus. Unfortunately, proinflammatory cytokines (almost like stray bullets hitting normal habitat) damage and increase the leakiness of the blood vessels, facilitating easier entry into the virus’s secondary targets, endothelial cells. Ebola virus causes considerable damage to liver cells, which lose normal functioning adding to a plethora of problems.26URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012804230400008XT. Leichner, T. Kambayashi, in , 2014Concluding RemarksWBCs exhibit specific and distinct functions that cooperate to form the basis of the immune system. Together, they are able to provide a quick, efficient, specific, and long-lasting response to invading pathogens. In addition to pathogen control, the immune system also plays a beneficial role in wound healing, homeostasis, and protection against cancer (Figure 8). A balanced cooperation of WBCs is necessary, as disarray can cause inappropriate immune responses leading to autoimmunity, allergy, immunopathology, and even cancer promotion. Many of these functions are carried out at the primary site as well as within lymphoid organs. Understanding the function of WBCs is essential, as the immune system contributes to many aspects of human biology.Figure 8. Roles of white blood cells in the immune system. Well-orchestrated responses of WBCs leads to desirable outcomes such as protection against pathogens, wound healing, clearance of senescent cells, and antitumor responses. However, an imbalance in WBC activation can lead to undesirable outcomes such as immunopathology, allergy, autoimmunity, and promotion of cancer.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128012383000702Lirong Qu, Darrell Triulzi, in , 2019Blood ComponentsWhole blood usually is processed into blood components (red blood cells [RBCs], platelets, and plasma) so that each component can be stored at its optimal condition and patients receive only the specific blood components they need. Automatic cell separation (apheresis) technology can also be used to collect RBCs, platelets, and/or plasma. A single apheresis platelets (single-donor platelets) collection or 4 to 5 units of pooled platelets contain sufficient numbers of platelets for a therapeutic dose in an adult patient.The shelf life of RBC component is determined by the anticoagulant and preservative used; the most commonly used additive solution (ADSOL) allows for up to 42 days of storage at 4°C (1°–6°C) for RBCs. The volume is approximately 350 mL, of which 200 mL is red cells (hematocrit around 60%). In a 70-kg adult, transfusion of one unit RBCs is expected to increase the hemoglobin by 10 g/L or hematocrit by 3%. Platelets are stored at 20° to 24°C with constant agitation for maximum of 5 days. Four to five units of whole blood–derived platelets or one unit of apheresis platelets can increase platelet count by 20 to 40 × 109/L in a 70-kg patient. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) is frozen and stored at −18°C within 8 hours of collection. It is thawed at 37°C and then stored at 4°C for 24 hours. FFP has a volume of 200 to 250 mL and contains “normal” level of all coagulation factors. Thawed plasma is similar to FFP but can be stored up to 5 days at 1° to 6°C and is clinically interchangeable with FFP. Cryoprecipitate is made from thawing FFP in cold temperature (between 1° and 6°C) and recovering the precipitate. Cryoprecipitate contains fibrinogen (≥150 mg), Factor VIII (≥80 IU), Factor XIII, Von Willebrand factor (vWF), and fibronectin in approximately 5 to 20 mL of plasma; therefore it is a more concentrated source of these coagulation factors than plasma.1Leukocyte-Reduced Blood ComponentsWhite blood cells (WBCs) in the blood components can mediate adverse effects. White cells are removed primarily by filtration or apheresis processing. Leukocyte-reduction filters remove 3 to 5 logs (99.9% to 99.999%) of WBCs from whole blood–derived RBCs and platelet components. Leukoreduction can be performed before the component is stored (prestorage leukoreduction) or at the time blood is issued for transfusion (poststorage leukoreduction). Components collected by apheresis technology usually are leukoreduced as part of the collection. The benefits of leukocyte-reduced blood components include: prevention or decrease the incidence of HLA allo-immunization (and platelet refractoriness), reduction of the incidence of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions, and reduction of transfusion-transmitted WBC-associated viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).1 Other potential benefits, such as avoiding immunomodulatory effects of transfusion, remain controversial.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323449427000601Kelly Walkovich, James A. Connelly, in , 2022AbstractWhite blood cells (WBCs), both granulocytes (e.g., neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils) and mononuclear cells (e.g., monocytes and lymphocytes), are central to the innate and adaptive immune system, serving to mitigate infectious, traumatic, and malignant insults. Knowledge of normal leukocyte development and function is essential to understanding how their absence and/or dysfunction results in disease. While primary neutrophil disorders have been a long-standing mainstay of hematology training, the increasing recognition of neutropenia and other WBC aberrations as a feature of primary immunodeficiency disorders and autoimmune/immune dysregulation disorders reinforces the need for hematologists to have a broad differential in the evaluation of patients with leukocyte abnormalities.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128216712000027Krista L. Hillyer, James R. Eckman, in , 2007FEBRILE NONHEMOLYTIC TRANSFUSION REACTIONSWhite blood cells (WBCs) synthesize and release various cytokines during storage of cellular blood products that may cause fever and chills (febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions) in the transfusion recipient.80 Current technologies in leukoreduction filtration reduce the leukocyte count in RBCs to less than 5 × 106 WBC/unit, mitigating the development of febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions in recipients of leukoreduced blood products.80 Because SCD patients typically receive large numbers of transfusions and febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions occur in association with 0.5% to 1% of transfusions,81 most experts recommend the use of leukoreduced blood products for all SCD patients. In addition, an acute infection or a pain crisis can manifest with the same symptoms (i.e., fever, chills, malaise) as a febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction, confounding the clinical picture and possibly delaying appropriate treatment of underlying disorders in SCD patients.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780443069819500430Joseph Feher, in , 2012The White Blood Cells Include Neutrophils, Eosinophils, Basophils, Monocytes, Lymphocytes, and PlateletsThe white blood cells are called leukocytes (from the Greek “leukos” meaning “white” and “kytos,” meaning “cell”). The granular leukocytes (eosinophils, neutrophils, and basophils) are named for the granules in their cytoplasm; the agranular leukocytes (monocytes and lymphocytes) lack cytoplasmic granules. All of the granular leukocytes have polymorphic nuclei that appear as two to five ovate-shaped lobes that are connected by strands. Histological stains help differentiate among the different white blood cells. The microscopic appearance of these cells is shown in Figure 5.3.1.Figure 5.3.1. The various types of white blood cells. The polymorpho-nuclear granulocytes possess lobed nuclei and cytoplasmic granules. Cytoplasmic granules in eosinophils take up eosin, a histological dye; cytoplasmic granules of basophils stain with a basic, blue dye. Neutrophils have granules that do not stain with either eosin or basic dyes. The monocytes are larger than the polymorphonuclear granulocytes. They have a single oval or horseshoe-shaped nucleus and relatively few cytoplasmic granules. Lymphocytes contain a single, oval-shaped nucleus and small amounts of cytoplasm. Platelets are cell fragments.Each mm3 of blood contains some 5–5.5×106 red blood cells but only about 4000–11,000 white blood cells. Of these, the neutrophils comprise 50–70%, the lymphocytes 20–40%, the monocytes 2–8%, the eosinophils 1–4%, and the basophils <1%. Platelets are cell fragments of megakaryocytes. The platelets typically number between 0.2 and 0.5×106 particles per mm3 of blood. The relative fraction of white blood cells contributed by each type is shown in Figure 5.3.2.Figure 5.3.2. Fraction of leukocytes contributed by each class. The major class of white blood cells is the neutrophil, followed in order by the lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B978012800883600046XN. Raghavendra Rao, in , 20228.6 Characteristics of immune systemThe immune system in the human body is made up of special organs, cells, and chemicals that fight infection (microbes). The main parts of the immune system are white blood cells, the lymphatic system, the spleen, the thymus, and the bone marrow. These are the parts in the human body's immune system that actively fight infection. The immune system keeps a record of every microbe it has ever defeated in the types of white blood cells. These are otherwise known as memory cells. This means that it can recognize and destroy the microbe quickly. Suppose it enters the human body again before it can multiply and makes a person feel sick. Some infections like the flu and the common cold have to be fought many times. It is because so many different viruses or strains of the same type of viruses can cause these illnesses from other viruses. It means that it does not give the human body immunity against others.8.6.1 White blood cellsWhite blood cells are the key players in the human body's immune system. They are made in the bone marrow and part of the lymphatic system. White blood cells move through blood and tissues throughout the human body, looking for microbes such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. Once they find them, they launch an immune attack.8.6.2 AntibodiesAntibodies help the human body to fight microbes or toxins (poisons), they produce. They do this by recognizing substances called antigens on the surface of the microbe. Or in the chemicals they produce. Then they mark the microbe or toxin as being foreign. The antibodies mark these antigens for destruction. There are many cells, proteins, and chemicals involved in this attack.8.6.3 Complement systemThe complement system is made up of proteins whose actions complement the work done by antibodies.8.6.4 Lymphatic systemThe lymphatic system is a network of tubes through the human body. The main role of the lymphatic system is to manage the fluid levels in the human body. Another important function that reacts to bacteria and deals with cancer cells. Otherwise, it will result in diseases or disorders. It also absorbs some of the fats in one's diet from the intestine.8.6.5 SpleenThe spleen is a block of filtering organs that remove microbes and destroys old or damaged red blood cells. It also makes disease-fighting components in the immune system.8.6.6 Bone marrowBone marrow is the spongy tissue found inside the bones of the human body. It produces the red blood cells in the human body to carry oxygen.8.6.7 ThymusThe thymus filters and monitors one's blood content. It produces white blood cells.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323900546000040K.R. Anu, ... Alex Joseph, in , 20238.2 COVID-19 and therapeutic treatmentWhite blood cells (WBCs) are usually normal or have a modest drop in number during the early stages of infection. At the same time, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α lead to cytokine storm and thereby aggravation of viral infection. The primary symptom of the disease is pneumonia in most of patients. Underlying diseases and age are other factors that worsen the condition. Drugs act via different mechanisms as well as targeting different stages of the viral cell cycle. Various drugs were repurposed against SARS-CoV-2 and recently vaccines are also developed to fight this global pandemic.

The bone marrow then stores an estimated of white blood cells.When an infection or inflammatory condition occurs, the body releases white blood cells to help fight the infection.In this article, learn more about white blood cells, including the types and their functions.Health professionals have identified three main categories of white blood cell: granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes. The sections below discuss these in more detail.GranulocytesGranulocytes are white blood cells that have small granules containing proteins. There are three types of granulocyte cells:Basophils: These represent less than of white blood cells in the body and are typically present in increased numbers after an allergic reaction.Eosinophils: These are responsible for responding to infections that parasites cause. They also play a role in the general immune response, as well as the inflammatory response, in the body.Neutrophils: These represent the of white blood cells in the body. They act as scavengers, helping surround and destroy bacteria and fungi that may be present in the body.LymphocytesThese white blood cells include the following:B cells: Also known as B-lymphocytes, these cells produce antibodies to help the immune system mount a response to infection.T cells: Also known as T-lymphocytes, these white blood cells help recognize and remove infection-causing cells.Natural killer cells: These cells are responsible for attacking and killing viral cells, as well as cells.MonocytesMonocytes are white blood cells that make up around of the total white blood cell count in the body. These are present when the body fights off chronic infections.They target and destroy cells that cause infections.According to an article in , the normal range (per cubic millimeter) of white blood cells based on age are:AgeNormal rangeNewborn infant13,000–38,0002-week-old infant5,000–20,000Adult4,500–11,000The normal range for a pregnant women in the 3rd trimester is 5,800–13,200 per cubic millimeter.High white blood cell countIf a person’s body is producing more white blood cells than it should be, doctors call this leukocytosis.A high white blood cell count may indicate the following medical conditions:allergic responses, such as due to an attackthose that may cause cells to die, such as burns, , and traumainflammatory conditions, such as , inflammatory bowel disease, or vasculitisinfections, such as with bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasitesSurgical procedures that cause cells to die can also cause a high white blood cell count.Low white blood cell countIf a person’s body is producing fewer white blood cells than it should be, doctors call this .Conditions that can cause leukopenia include:autoimmune conditions such as and bone marrow damage, such as from chemotherapy, , or exposure to toxinsbone marrow disordersleukemia, which is a severe type of infection deficienciesDoctors may continually monitor white blood cells to determine if the body is mounting an immune response to an infection.During a physical examination, a doctor may perform a white blood cell count (WBC) using a blood test. They may order a WBC to test for, or rule out, other conditions that may affect white blood cells.Although a blood sample is the most common approach to testing for white blood cells, a doctor can also test other body fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid, for the presence of white blood cells.A doctor may order a WBC to:test for allergiestest for infectiontest for leukemiamonitor the progression of certain conditionsmonitor the effectiveness of some treatments, such as bone marrow transplantsThe following are conditions that may impact how many white blood cells a person has in their body.Aplastic anemiaThis is a condition wherein a person’s body destroys stem cells in the bone marrow.Stem cells are responsible for creating new white blood cells, , and platelets.Evans syndromeThis is an autoimmune condition wherein the body’s immune system destroys healthy cells, including red and white blood cells.HIVHIV can the amount of white blood cells called CD4 T cells.

White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes, are the cells of the immune system that protect the body against infectious disease, allergens, and other foreign invaders. The number of white blood cells in the can often tell the health care provider if a disease is present. The normal number of white blood cells is usually between 4,000–11,000 cells per microliter of blood. Having more WBCs in the blood than normal is called leukocytosis, and having fewer WBCS than normal is called leukopenia. There are many types of white blood cells, each with very specific jobs: Neutrophils are the most common WBC. Around 60-70% of circulating leukocytes are neutrophils. These cells defend the body against or infection by digesting bacteria in a process called phagocytosis. Eosinophils are fewer in number, but have an important role in allergic reactions and other functions. Only about 2-4% of WBCs are eosinophils, but that number rises in response to allergies, parasites, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in certain diseases of the spleen and central nervous system. Basophils respond to allergens and other invaders by releasing two chemicals that aid in the body’s defenses: histamine and heparin. Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue, whereas heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents blood clotting. B cells make that can bind to, and enhance their destruction. T cells come in 3 types: helper cells, cytotoxic cells and natural killer cells. Together, they help coordinate the immune response and maintain immune system integrity. Monocytes not only share the infection-eating function of neutrophils, but also present pieces of disease-carrying bacteria and other organisms to T cells so that the they may be killed. What are common white blood cell disorders? Two major types of white blood cell disorders are proliferative disorders and leukopenias. In the proliferative disorders, there is an increase in the number of white blood cells. This increase is commonly a reaction due to infection, but may, less commonly, be related to some types of cancer. In leukopenias, there is a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which can be caused by cells being destroyed by an illness or by other conditions. One particular kind of leukopenia is neutropenia, which means that there are fewer neutrophils in the blood. Outside causes of neutropenia include chemotherapy, medications, toxins, and viral illness. Disorders that can cause neutropenia within the body include defects in bone marrow (where all WBCs are created), or conditions in which a person is born with too few neutrophils. Both leukopenia and neutropenia can cause deficiency in the immune system, which can increase risk of infection. Treatment of leukopenia and neutropenia are aimed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts. An increase in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis. Leukocytosis can be caused by inflammation and other disorders that result in increased bone marrow production (which leads to greater production of WBCS), too many WBCs being released from bone marrow all at once, or disorders that prevent WBCs from attaching to tissues and being absorbed by the body’s tissues. Our approach to white blood cell disorders All of the disorders discussed above have to do with the number of white blood cells. Other disorders include those in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally. If white blood cells form abnormally, it can affect their ability to perform normal functions such as killing bacteria. Specialized testing is available through our center to further determine what the treatment will be.

Although the specific functions of the white blood cell subtypes differ widely, all of them exist to defend the organism against non-endogenous agents in the broadest sense. Myeloid white blood cells are produced in bone marrow. Lymphoid cell development, however, is not restricted to bone marrow and takes place in primary and secondary lymphatic organs. The total number of white blood cells in healthy adults ranges approximately between 4‒10 x106/µL, of which neutrophils and lymphocytes make up the majority. Monocytes, eosinophils and basophils are found in far smaller numbers in healthy persons. The absolute count of each white blood cell subtype in peripheral blood has clinical significance and is more informative than the relative count given as a percentage. White blood cell pathologies affecting either the myeloid or lymphoid lineage can be the result of both reactive and non-reactive (malignant) disease. Reactive changes are observed in the course of infectious or inflammatory diseases whereas malignant alterations point to leukaemia, lymphomas and other haematologic malignancies. To distinguish between different diseases related to white blood cells, determining both their number and their exact type and state of maturity and activation is crucial. Automated haematology analysis is an essential component in the diagnostic process and helps to identify the presence of disease by providing accurate cell counts, highlighting conspicuous cell populations and providing additional information on the cell functionality, e.g. for neutrophil and lymphocyte activation. With white blood cell diseases, finding the right diagnosis is complex and needs all the information available from the complete blood count, morphology analysis, immune phenotyping, and other tests. Neutrophils Lymphocytes Monocytes Eosinophils Basophils Neutrophils Neutrophils belong to the granulocytes, which are characterised by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm. They play an important role in immune defence and are the first immune cells to arrive at a site of inflammation – usually within minutes. This happens through a process known as ‘chemotaxis’. Neutrophils can phagocytose other cells which seem harmful to the organism, such as bacteria. Yet they will not survive this act: pus consists mainly of dead neutrophils and digested bacteria. Acute infections commonly cause various degrees of neutrophilia due to the release of segmented neutrophils and bands from the bone marrow and marginating pool. This reactive neutrophilia is often associated with the presence of toxic granulation, Doehle bodies, cytoplasmic vacuoles and elevated levels of leucocyte (neutrophil) alkaline phosphatase (LAP). An increased neutrophil count can also be found due to primary abnormalities in the regulation of bone marrow neutrophil production, or physiologically in non-pathological situations, e.g. after stress or in smokers. The absolute and relative neutrophil count can provide some information for diagnosis and monitoring of infections and is also watched during chemotherapy. Lymphocytes Lymphocytes defend the organism against infection by distinguishing the body’s own cells from foreign ones. Molecules recognised by the body as foreign are known as antigens. Each lymphocyte is only stimulated by one specific antigen. When lymphocytes recognise this antigen, they produce chemicals to fight it. There are three main types of lymphocytes: B cells, T cells and natural killer cells. Although ­‒ compared with other white blood cells ‒ all lymphocytes are small and round without granules, there is a large variety of different subtypes, and distinguishing between them morphologically is tricky. Reasons for an increased lymphocyte count include infection or inflammation, as well as certain types of malignancies, especially haematologic malignancies. In addition to giving an absolute and relative lymphocyte count, several flags on Sysmex analysers can point to suspicious lymphocytes for which presence a follow-up test should be performed. Monocytes Monocytes play a key role in the immune response. They can quickly move to infection sites and differentiate into macrophages and dendritic cells to provoke an immune response. Cells of the monocyte-macrophage system can engulf foreign particles and break them down to antigens, which they can then present on their surface. Automated monocyte counts are available as the ratio of monocytes to the total count of white blood cells, or as an absolute count. An increased monocyte count may be indicative of various disease states, e.g. chronic inflammation or infection, but may also occur in malignant diseases such as chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. Eosinophils Like neutrophils, eosinophils belong to the granulocytes because they are filled with granules containing different enzymes. Eosinophils are best known for their roles in anti-helminth immunity and allergic diseases including those affecting the skin, respiratory system and gastrointestinal tract. They can also move and phagocytose particles. Since they kill helminthic parasites by releasing certain cytotoxic enzymes to amplify the inflammatory response and are involved in hypersensitivity reactions, an increased eosinophil count is most likely associated with parasite infestation or allergy. However, eosinophilia can also point to malignant diseases as it is evident in some types of neoplasia. Basophils Basophils are the white blood cells least represented in peripheral blood; they also belong to the granulocytes. Like with eosinophils, an increase in the basophil count often ‒ though not always ‒ points to allergy or parasitic infections. Basophils are also present at the site of an inflammatory reaction. They seem to play a role similar to that of eosinophils in the defence against pathogens. Like eosinophils, they are recruited to the sites of allergic reactions and function together with mast cells as effector cells in complex processes such as chemotaxis or cell adhesion and fulfil an immunomodulatory role during allergic reactions.

White Blood Cells VIDEO Like all blood cells, white blood cells are produced primarily in the bone marrow. They develop from stem (precursor) cells that mature into one of the five major types of white blood cells: Basophils Eosinophils Lymphocytes Monocytes Neutrophils Normally, people produce about 100 billion white blood cells a day.

The immune system keeps a record of every germ (microbe) it has ever defeated so it can recognise and destroy the microbe quickly if it enters the body again.Abnormalities of the immune system can lead to allergic diseases, immunodeficiencies and autoimmune disorders. On this page Immune system The immune system is made up of a complex network of organs, cells and proteins that fight infection (microbes). The immune system and microbial infection The keeps a record of every microbe it has ever defeated, in types of white blood cells (B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes) known as memory cells. This means it can recognise and destroy the microbe quickly if it enters the body again, before it can multiply and make you feel sick. Some infections, like the and the , have to be fought many times because so many different viruses or strains of the same type of virus can cause these illnesses. Catching a cold or flu from one virus does not give you immunity against the others. Parts of the immune system The main parts of the immune system are: white blood cells antibodies complement system thymus.White blood cells White blood cells are the key players in your immune system. They are made in your bone marrow and are part of the lymphatic system. White blood cells move through blood and tissue throughout your body, looking for foreign invaders (microbes) such as , parasites and fungi. When they find them, they launch an immune attack. White blood cells include lymphocytes (such as B-cells, T-cells and natural killer cells), and many other types of immune cells. Antibodies Antibodies help the body to fight microbes or the toxins (poisons) they produce. They do this by recognising substances called antigens on the surface of the microbe, or in the chemicals they produce, which mark the microbe or toxin as being foreign. The antibodies then mark these antigens for destruction. There are many cells, proteins and chemicals involved in this attack. Complement system The complement system is made up of proteins whose actions complement the work done by antibodies. Lymphatic system The is a network of delicate tubes throughout the body. The main roles of the lymphatic system are to: manage the fluid levels in the body react to bacteria deal with cancer cells deal with cell products that otherwise would result in disease or disorders absorb some of the fats in our diet from the intestine.The lymphatic system is made up of: lymph nodes (also called lymph glands) – which trap microbes lymph vessels – tubes that carry lymph, the colourless fluid that bathes your body's tissues and contains infection-fighting white blood cells white blood cells (lymphocytes).Spleen The is a blood-filtering organ that removes microbes and destroys old or damaged red blood cells. It also makes disease-fighting components of the immune system (including antibodies and lymphocytes). Bone marrow is the spongy tissue found inside your bones. It produces the red blood cells our bodies need to carry oxygen, the white blood cells we use to fight infection, and the platelets we need to help our blood clot. Thymus The thymus filters and monitors your blood content. It produces the white blood cells called T-lymphocytes. The body's other defences against microbes As well as the immune system, the body has several other ways to defend itself against microbes, including: – a waterproof barrier that secretes oil with bacteria-killing properties – mucous in the lungs (phlegm) traps foreign particles, and small hairs (cilia) wave the mucous upwards so it can be coughed out – the mucous lining contains antibodies, and the acid in the stomach can kill most microbes other defences – body fluids like skin oil, saliva and tears contain anti-bacterial enzymes that help reduce the risk of infection. The constant flushing of the urinary tract and the bowel also helps.Fever is an immune system response A rise in body temperature, or , can happen with some infections. This is actually an immune system response. A rise in temperature can kill some microbes. Fever also triggers the body's repair process. Common disorders of the immune system It is common for people to have an over- or underactive immune system. can take many forms, including: allergic diseases – where the immune system makes an overly strong response to allergens. Allergic diseases are very common. They include: allergies to , or sinus disease dermatitis . – where the immune system mounts a response against normal components of the body. Autoimmune diseases range from common to rare. They include: autoimmune thyroid disease systemic vasculitis.Underactivity of the immune system, also called immunodeficiency, can: be inherited – examples of these conditions include such as common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and complement deficiencies arise as a result of medical treatment – this can occur due to medications such as or be caused by another disease – such as or certain types of .An underactive immune system does not function correctly and makes people vulnerable to infections. It can be life threatening in severe cases. People who have had an need immunosuppression treatment to prevent the body from attacking the transplanted organ. Immunoglobulin therapy Immunoglobulins (commonly known as antibodies) are used to treat people who are unable to make enough of their own, or whose antibodies do not work properly. This treatment is known as . Until recently, immunoglobulin therapy in Australia mostly involved delivery of immunoglobulins through a drip into the vein – known as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy. Now, can be delivered into the fatty tissue under the skin, which may offer benefits for some patients. This is known as subcutaneous infusion or SCIg therapy. Subcutaneous immunoglobulin is similar to intravenous immunoglobulin. It is made from plasma – the liquid part of blood containing important proteins like antibodies. to read more about this type of treatment. Many health services are now offering SCIg therapy to eligible patients with specific immune conditions. If you are interested, please discuss your particular requirements with your . Immunisation works by copying the body's natural immune response. A vaccine (a small amount of a specially treated virus, bacterium or toxin) is injected into the body. The body then makes antibodies to it. If a vaccinated person is exposed to the actual virus, bacterium or toxin, they won't get sick because their body will recognise it and know how to attack it successfully. Vaccinations are available against many diseases, including and . The immunisations you may need are decided by your health, age, lifestyle and occupation. Together, these factors are referred to as HALO, which is defined as: Health – some health conditions or factors may make you more vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, premature birth, asthma, diabetes, , lung, spleen or conditions, and HIV will mean you may benefit from additional or more frequent immunisations. Age – at different ages you need protection from different vaccine-preventable diseases. sets out recommended immunisations for babies, children, older people and other people at risk, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Most recommended vaccines are available at no cost to these groups. Lifestyle – lifestyle choices can have an impact on your immunisation needs. , planning a family, , , and playing contact sport that may expose you directly to someone else's blood, will mean you may benefit from additional or more frequent immunisations. Occupation – you are likely to need extra immunisations, or need to have them more often, if you work in an occupation that exposes you to vaccine-preventable diseases or puts you into contact with people who are more susceptible to problems from vaccine-preventable diseases (such as babies or young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with chronic or acute health conditions). For example, if you work in aged care, childcare, healthcare, emergency services or sewerage repair and maintenance, discuss your immunisation needs with your doctor.

White blood cells (WBCs) are a type of cells found in blood. They form just 1% of your blood but are entrusted with the function of immunity. So, white blood cells circulate in the blood and help the immune system fight off microbes and infections caused by them. When the body identifies an intruder or an infection, it releases white blood cells to fight them. This often causes an inflammatory reaction. White blood cells are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow. In fact, 80 to 90% of white blood cells are stored in the bone marrow. Types and functions of white blood cells White blood cells can be broadly classified into granulocytes and agranulocytes, depending on the presence or absence of small protein granules in them. Granulocytes There are three types of granulocytes, namely: Basophils: These form less than 1% of the white blood cells in the body. The basophil number usually increases during an allergic reaction. Basophils produce chemicals like histamine to control the body’s immune response. Eosinophils: These white blood cells are primarily responsible for responding to parasitic infections but also play a role in the body’s general immune and inflammatory responses. They have also been found to attack and kill cancer cells. Neutrophils: These cells form the majority of white blood cells in the body. They are essentially scavengers that identify an infectious agent like bacteria or fungi and destroy them. Neutrophils form the first line of the body’s defence mechanism. Agranulocytes There are two types of agranulocytes. They are: Lymphocytes: These white blood cells produce substances called antibodies to fight against microbes and other harmful invaders. Lymphocytes are of three types: B cells: These cells produce antibodies to help the immune system fight infections in the body. They are also called B-lymphocytes. T cells: These white blood cells identify and attack infection-causing cells and remove them from the body. Natural killer cells: As the name suggests, natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that attack and kill viral and cancer cells. Monocytes: These cells form 2 to 8% of your total white blood cell count. These cells usually have a longer lifespan than other WBCs and are responsible for fighting off chronic infections. What is the normal count of white blood cells? The optimum white blood cells count in your body is an indicator that your immune system is functioning normally. The normal range of white blood cells is between 4,000 and 11,000/microlitre. The WBC count may vary depending on your age and gender. The count may be different in children and pregnant women. What do abnormal WBC counts indicate? Certain health conditions and diseases can give rise to abnormal white blood cell count. Depending on the disease, the WBC count can be higher or lower than normal. High white blood cell count When the body produces excessive amounts of WBCs, it is termed leucocytosis. If you have a high white blood cell count, it may be indicative of one of the following conditions: Allergic response (commonly seen in people with asthma and atopic dermatitis) Burns Trauma Heart attack Inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, eczema Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites or viruses Leukaemia Sometimes, undergoing a surgical procedure can also raise your WBC count temporarily. Low white blood cell count When the body produces fewer than normal white blood cells, the condition is called leucopenia. A few conditions that may cause leucopenia include: Autoimmune diseases like lupus HIV Bone marrow disorders Lymphoma Bone marrow damage due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy or toxin exposure Sepsis Vitamin B12 deficiency Wrapping it up It is important to understand what white blood cells (WBCs) are and their vital role in the immune system. The different types of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, have unique features and perform their function to ensure the body is protected from harmful invaders and substances. A healthy white blood cell count within the normal range is a good indicator of your immune system’s strength. However, if you observe any significant deviations from the normal count, you must seek immediate consultation from your doctor for further evaluation. At , we offer accurate and reliable diagnostic testing, made possible by our state-of-the-art facilities and experienced team.

Different blood cancers affect different types of blood cell. Types of blood cell White blood cells White blood cells help your body fight infection. They are part of your .The main types of white blood cell are:neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils (all called granulocytes)lymphocytes (there are B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes)monocytes Red blood cells Your red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all the cells in your body. Inside your red blood cells there is a protein called haemoglobin which helps carry the oxygen. Platelets Platelets help your blood to clot. They stick together to stop bleeding if you have a cut or a bruise. How blood cells normally develop All your blood cells start off as special cells called blood stem cells, which are made in the bone marrow (a soft material inside your bones).Blood stem cells can divide and multiply in the bone marrow to produce many other blood cells. The diagram below shows how blood stem cells can grow into any of the blood cells that are needed, including white blood cells, red blood cells and platelets.Your bone marrow makes a huge number of blood cells every second. If everything’s working normally, your body makes the right number of each type of cell to keep you healthy.If something goes wrong with the process below, blood cancer can occur, and you may get blood cells not developing properly, or multiplying too quickly. Blood cells Full blood count A full blood count is a blood test that checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets in your blood.Everyone has slightly different numbers of each type of blood cell. If you’re healthy, the amount normally stays the same, with slight changes over time.Below is an idea of the normal ranges for blood cells in a healthy adult.The numbers might look complicated, but your health care team may use them in a simple way. For example, ‘your haemoglobin is 140’ or ‘your neutrophils are 4’. Levels found in a healthy person by cell type What is blood cancer?

It is made from plasma – the liquid part of blood containing important proteins like antibodies. to read more about this type of treatment. Many health services are now offering SCIg therapy to eligible patients with specific immune conditions. If you are interested, please discuss your particular requirements with your . Immunisation works by copying the body's natural immune response. A vaccine (a small amount of a specially treated virus, bacterium or toxin) is injected into the body. The body then makes antibodies to it. If a vaccinated person is exposed to the actual virus, bacterium or toxin, they won't get sick because their body will recognise it and know how to attack it successfully. Vaccinations are available against many diseases, including and . The immunisations you may need are decided by your health, age, lifestyle and occupation. Together, these factors are referred to as HALO, which is defined as: Health – some health conditions or factors may make you more vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. For example, premature birth, asthma, diabetes, , lung, spleen or conditions, and HIV will mean you may benefit from additional or more frequent immunisations. Age – at different ages you need protection from different vaccine-preventable diseases. sets out recommended immunisations for babies, children, older people and other people at risk, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Most recommended vaccines are available at no cost to these groups. Lifestyle – lifestyle choices can have an impact on your immunisation needs. , planning a family, , , and playing contact sport that may expose you directly to someone else's blood, will mean you may benefit from additional or more frequent immunisations. Occupation – you are likely to need extra immunisations, or need to have them more often, if you work in an occupation that exposes you to vaccine-preventable diseases or puts you into contact with people who are more susceptible to problems from vaccine-preventable diseases (such as babies or young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and people with chronic or acute health conditions). For example, if you work in aged care, childcare, healthcare, emergency services or sewerage repair and maintenance, discuss your immunisation needs with your doctor.

It is made up of different types of , which are produced in the bone marrow. It is about 80% water and 20% solids.Types of Blood Cells:The blood is made up of four different types of cells: Red blood cells (RBC) White blood cells (WBC) Plasma PlateletsThe composition of blood is as follows:, ~55% of plasma and ~45% of blood cells. Now we will discuss briefly about WBC.Red Blood CellsRed blood cells are biconcave cells, and these do not have a nucleus in humans. These cells are also called erythrocytes. RBCs have a rich iron protein called haemoglobin that gives the blood its red colour. The primary and core function of these cells is to transport oxygen from various tissues and organs of the human body.What are White Blood Cells?WBC is a type of blood cell which helps us to fight against diseases. These WBC are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow and it is found in the blood and lymph tissue. WBC are also called .The lifespan of WBC is about 13 to 20 days. After this, they are destroyed inside the lymphatic system. The normal white blood cell count in blood is 4,500 to 11,000 per microlitre.PlasmaPlasma is the extracellular and liquid portion of blood and is transparent or pale yellow coloured. Plasma in blood contains 80–90% water, and the remaining 10% is salts, enzymes, nutrients, lipids, and hormones.PlateletsThese are tiny fragments of blood cells that facilitate the formation of clots in our bodies to stop bleeding. Platelets help repair the damage and rush towards blood vessels whenever there is any damage in them. White Blood Cells FunctionWBC are a part of the immune system, if there is a decrease in the immune power, then the body releases the WBC. The main function of these cells is to protect the body from getting affected by foreign particles. Whenever an infection or foreign particle invades the body, the WBC builds up the antibodies and attacks the germs to destroy it.White blood cells are also known as leucocytes or leukocytes. It helps to stimulate the production of progesterone hormone in our body. It is essential for our reproductive systems as it helps create a network of blood vessels in the ovary.If your body is struggling and a specific area is under attack, the white blood cells surge into the area to destroy the harmful substance and avoid illnesses.Types of White Blood Cells and Their Function:There are three different types of white blood cells:1. Granulocytes: Granulocytes are a type of WBC, which has small granules made up of proteins. These are further divided into three types, and they are:a. Basophils: Basophils helps to provide immune responses to parasitic infections. In addition to that, it has the following functions:Prevents blood clotting: Basophil contains a substance called heparin, which is a blood-thinning substance, this avoids clotting of blood inside the body.Mediates allergic reactions: When an immune system is exposed to an allergen, the basophil releases a substance called histamine which helps to kill the allergens, it is well known for its role to fight against asthma.b. Eosinophils: Eosinophils are the special cells inside the immune system which are involved in inflammatory and anti-parasitic responses.c. Neutrophils: Neutrophils help to heal damaged tissues, it also helps to fight against bacterial or viral infections.Difference Between Basophils, Eosinophils, and Neutrophils:CharacteristicsBasophilsEosinophilsNeutrophilsRoleHelps to diagnose autoimmune disease or blood-related disordersHelps to fight against allergies and diseasesProvide an immune response against any foreign particle attackNucleusMulti-lobed nucleusBean-shaped nucleusTwo or bilobed nucleusLife spanLife span is about 60–70 hoursLife span is about 8–12 hoursLife span is about 5– to 90 hoursSizeDiameter is of 10–14 micrometresDiameter is about 12–17 micrometresDiametre is about 8.86 micrometresDisordersHypothyroidismLeukopenia (low level) and Eosinophilia (high level) Leukocytosis (high level) and Neutropenia (low level)2. Lymphocytes: The lymphocytes are further divided into three types:B cells: The B cells are also referred to as B lymphocytes, which produce antibodies in the immune system.T Cells: The T cells are also referred to as T lymphocytes, which helps to recognize and remove the infection-causing pathogens.Natural Killer Cells: These cells are responsible for attacking and killing the pathogens, it also kills cancerous cells.Difference Between B Cells and T Cells:CharacteristicsB CellsT CellsSite of maturationIt originates and matures in the bone marrow.It originates in the bone marrow and matures in the thymus.Also calledB lymphocytes.T lymphocytes.PositionPresent outside the lymph nodes.Present inside the lymph nodes.Life spanShorter life span.Larger life span compared to B cells.3.

What are the foods that increase the count of white blood cells?Consuming foods which are rich in vitamin C will increase the WBC count. The foods which are rich in vitamin C are citrus fruits which include, grapefruit, oranges, lemon, and bell peppers.2. What are the symptoms of low white blood cell count?Below are the symptoms of low white blood cell count in a human body -Having repeated fevers and infections.Bladder infections may make you urinate more often or make it painful to pass urine.Lung infections that cause coughing and you may feel difficulty in breathing.Mouth sores.Sinus infections and a stuffy nose.Skin infections.3. What are some common signs or indicators of white blood cell disorders?WBC disorder can cause serious harm to your body. It needs quick and instant treatment by a doctor. Whether you are facing a high or low WBC, you need to consult your doctor. The signs or common symptoms of white blood cell disorders, in which you might have high WBC or low WBC, are mentioned below:Frequent body aches, fever, and chills.Getting very frequently common infections.Wounds that are bleeding, red, swelling, pus or doesn't heal.Consistent coughing and difficulty in breathing.Muscle weakness and fatigue.4. What are the white blood cell disorders treatments?Treatment for WBC disorders depends upon the diagnosis and seriousness of the condition. Some of the most common treatments for WBC disorder are as follows:Intake of essential and deficit vitamins as per the doctor's advice.Intake antibiotics and proteins for infection prevention.Surgery to replace or repair the damaged bone marrow.Blood transfusion for its better flow.5. What are the differences between the roles of basophils and eosinophils?Basophils are used for diagnosing autoimmune diseases and help to facilitate blood-related disorders. On the other hand, eosinophils help cure allergies and common diseases. These cells facilitate inflammation responses by releasing histamine, serotonin, and heparin. Basophils are produced and grow in the bone marrow. It is better to have fewer eosinophils cells in our body as these are primarily tissue-dwelling. The cytoplasm of basophil stains is blue, whereas the cytoplasm of eosinophil stains is red.Related articlesBiology • Class 10Biology • Class 10Biology • Class 10Biology • Class 10Biology • Class 10Join Vedantu's Telegram ChannelGet exclusive access to Vedantu founders for thier expert insights, tips & Study Material to ace your exams.Join NowCompetitive Exams after 12th ScienceBook your Free Demo SessionShare your information for a call backSelect your ClassBook free sessionOur expert academic counsellors will be happy to patiently explain everything that you want to know.More for class 10Study materialsGet link in sms to download the app+ 91Get the linkKnow more about our courses.

The whole blood in EDTA is stable for 24 hours at 23° C and 48 hours at 4 °C. Don’t use heparin. Indications for White Blood Cells This is the routine test in CBC. TLC differentiates acute and chronic infections. TLC diagnoses leukemias. TLC is done as a follow-up test in patients on chemotherapy. This will help a patient with an allergy. Precautions for White Blood Cells: Physical activity and stress may cause an increase in WBCs and differential values. Pregnancy in the final months may cause an increase in WBC count. Patients with splenectomy have a persistent mild increase in the WBC count. Drugs that may increase the WBC county are: Aspirin. Allopurinol. Steroids. Quinine. Epinephrine. Adrenaline. Chloroform. Heparin. Drugs that will decrease the WBC count: Antibiotics. Anticonvulsant. Antimetabolites. Antithyroid drugs. Diuretics. Sulfonamides. Barbiturates. Chemotherapy. Pathophysiology of White Blood Cells Definition of hematopoiesis: This is the dynamic process of blood cell production and development of the various cells of the blood. All these cells develop from the totipotent stem cells. This hematopoiesis is characterized by the constant turnover of the blood cells. The normal hematopoietic system maintains a cell population of erythrocytes, white blood cells, and platelets through a complex network of tissues, stem cells, organs, and regulatory factors. Functions of the hematopoietic components (cells): It transports oxygen and excretes CO2 through RBCs. It fights infection by the WBCs. It performs the immune function (cellular and humoral immunity) through the lymphocytes. It maintains (hemostasis) the bleeding and the clotting process through the platelets. Development of myeloid (myelopoiesis) /erythroid (erythropoiesis) cells: In the first few weeks of gestation, the yolk sac (mesoderm) is the hematopoiesis’s main site. The first stem cells for hemopoiesis are observed in the dorsal aorta, called an aorta-gonads-mesonephros region. These common precursors of endothelial and hematopoietic cells will seed the bone marrow, liver, and spleen from 6 weeks until 7 months of fetal life. The liver and the spleen are the major hematopoietic organs and produce blood cells until around 2 weeks after birth. During childhood and adulthood, marrow is the only source of new blood cells. In adult life, the marrow consists of approximately 50% of the fats. After 4 years of age, fat cells start appearing in the long bones. 18 to 20 years, hematopoiesis is only found in the sternum, ribs, pelvis, vertebra, and skull. After 40 years, the sternum, ribs, vertebra, and pelvis comprise 50% fat and 50% hematopoietic tissue. Hematopoiesis in fetus Bone marrow activity: Bone marrow hematopoietic activity is divided into two pools: Stem cells pool. Bone marrow pool. Eventually, these cells get mature and are released into the peripheral blood. Hematopoiesis (Bone marrow) Hematopoiesis: Hematopoiesis starts from the pluripotential stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are rare; these are 1 in every 20 million nucleated cells. There is self-renewal of the stem cells. So the bone marrow cellularity remains constant in a normal healthy person. There is an amplification of the stem cells, and one stem cell can produce about 106 mature blood cells after 20 subdivisions. There is various type of stem cells, and these cells develop from the totipotent cells. Totipotent cells, also called embryonic stem cells and gave rise to: Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to myeloid and lymphoid cells. Epithelial stem cells give rise to organs like the liver etc. Mesenchymal stem cells give rise to muscles, tendons, and cartilage. Neural stem cells give rise to neural tissue. Differentiation of stem cell These parent stem cells have CD34+ and CD38– and have the appearance of small, medium-sized lymphocytes. These stem cells give rise to committed stem cells, and this process takes place under the influence of CFU (colony-forming unit). This whole process is shown in the following diagram. Maturation of all bone marrow hematopoietic cells White blood cells or leukocytes are divided into : Granulocytic series. These cells contain granules in their cytoplasm. Because of a multilobate nucleus, these are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Polys or PMN). These are of the following type: Neutrophils. Eosinophils. Basophils. Agranulocytic series is without any granules in their cytoplasm. These are also called mononuclear cells. These are : Lymphocytes. Monocytes. Platelets. White blood cells maturation White blood cells can also be divided into: Phagocytic cells: Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leucocytes, PMN). Eosinophils. Basophils. Monocytes. Immunocytic cells: Lymphocytes. Lymphocytes precursors. The Polys and lymphocytes comprise 75% to 90% of the total WBC count. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN): The neutrophils develop from the myeloblast, transforming into promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band forms, and neutrophils delivered into the peripheral blood. WBC maturation cycle The development of the neutrophils: These are also called segmented neutrophils or polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). The neutrophils are of two types: Segmented neutrophils are found in the peripheral blood. Tissue neutrophils have ample cytoplasm having irregular, blunt pseudopodia that are often multi-pointed and may have hazy cytoplasmic streamers. These cells are not phagocytic and seldom have cytoplasmic vacuoles. The cytoplasm stains light blue and has a fine latticelike structure. Granules vary in number and stain, which will be red to blue. These cells have large, round, or oval nuclei with coarse chromatin. Nucleoli are conspicuous and stain light blue. The cytokines involved are: Growth factors/cytokines Target cells GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor Neutrophils Eosinophils Monocytes M-CSF (Monocyte-macrophage CSF) Mononuclear phagocytic system IL-3 The precursor of: Neutrophils Monocyte Eosinophil Basophil Platelets Stem cells IL-7 Early granulocytes IL-8 Neutrophils Basophils T-lymphocytes The leukocytes’ total lifespan is 13 to 20 days, and they are produced in 7 to 14 days from the myeloblastic cells. Their life in the peripheral blood is just 7 to 10 hours and migrates to the tissue and is replenished by other cells released from the marrow. The polys have a characteristic dense nucleus consisting of 2 to 5 lobes and pale cytoplasm, with many fine pink-blue (azurophilic granules) or grey-blue granules. These granules are present in the lysosomes. White blood cells granules are divided into: Primary granules appear at the promyelocytic stage. These contain myeloperoxidase, acid phosphatase, and other hydrolases. Secondary (specific) granules appear at the myelocytic stage and predominate in the mature neutrophils. These granules contain collagenase, lactoferrin, and lysozyme. The role of the lysosomal enzyme in the destruction of the bacteria by the neutrophils are: Bacteria are phagocytosed into cells and fuse with the primary lysosomes to form a phagosome. Primary granules attack the bacteria. Secondary granules fuse with the phagosomes, and secondary enzymes attack the bacteria. Activated oxygen generated by glucose metabolism will kill the bacteria. Undigested, killed residual bacterial products are excreted by exocytosis. White blood cells’ Role in Bacterial Infection The function of Poly (PMN) is: The poly (PMN) gives immunity by fighting against infections and reacting against foreign bodies by various methods: Phagocytosis is the killing and digestion of bacteria. Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions. Eosinophils have a role in parasitic infestation. Basophils of the peripheral blood are also rich in histamine granules; they play a role in allergic reactions. Monocytic cells have the property of phagocytosis. They can kill bacteria and remove debris. Monocytes produced interferon. They have a longer life than neutrophils. Summary of the difference between various types of granulocytic series (neutrophils) cells: Characteristics Myeloblast Promyelocyte Myelocyte Metamyelocyte Band form Neutrophil Size of the cell 10 to 20 µm 10 to 20 µm 10 to 18 µm 10 to 18 µm 10 to 16 µm 10 to 16 µm Nuclear shape Round Round Oval or round Kidney shape Elongated Horseshoe shape 2 to 5 nuclear lobes N/C ratio 4:1 3:1 2:1 to 1:1 1:1 1:1 1:1 Nucleoli number 1 to 3 1 to 2 +/- None None None Nuclear chromatin and color Light reddish-blue no aggregation of material Light reddish-blue, fine meshwork Slight aggregation may be seen at the nuclear membrane. Light reddish-blue Fine chromatin, light aggregation, or granular pattern Light blue-purple with basophilic chromatin Purplish-red Clumped granular pattern. Purplish-red Clumped granular pattern. Cytoplasmic granules Absent Present fine azurophilic Non-specific granules Present, fine azurophilic, Specific granules Present, fine azurophilic Specific and neutrophilic Specific granules Fine violet-pink Specific granules, Fine violet-pink Amount of cytoplasm Basophilic and slight Basophilic and increased Bluish-pink and moderate Clear-pink and moderate Pink-abundant Pink-abundant Monocytes: Monocytes develop from the monoblast in the bone marrow. These macrophagic cells measure 25 to 80 µm with round or reniform nuclei and contain one or two nucleoli. There is clumped chromatin, abundant cytoplasm with vacuoles, and numerous azurophilic granules. These monocytes enter the circulation for a short time and then migrate to the tissue and transform into tissue macrophagic cells. Monocytes are also called histiocytes which means histio = tissue and cyte= cells. Monocytes in the peripheral blood smear When these monocytes are mature, they become too large to pass readily through the capillaries, so these settle in the tissue and convert into tissue macrophages in many organs like: In the lungs are called pulmonary alveolar macrophages. In the peritoneum are called peritoneal macrophages. In the spleen are called splenic macrophages. In the liver are called Kupffer’s cells. In the connective tissue are called tissue macrophages. These are also phagocytic cells. Monocytes don’t enter the circulation but can go back to circulation in case of inflammation. The function of monocytes: Their function as phagocytosis is similar to neutrophils. Monocytes can produce more rapidly than neutrophils and spend a longer time than neutrophils. Basophils: These cells all pass through the same stages as the neutrophils. These are also called mast cells when present in the tissue. The cells have large basophilic granules. The maturation of the basophils in the bone marrow takes more than 7 days. Basophils circulate in the peripheral blood for a few hours, then migrate to the tissue, skin, mucosa, and serosal surfaces. Morphology of the Basophil Eosinophils: Eosinophils spend 3 to 6 days developing in the bone marrow before appearing in the peripheral blood. These are stored in the bone marrow and released to the peripheral blood circulation when needed. The mean time in the circulation is about 8 hours. Eosinophils migrate from blood to bronchial mucosa, skin, GI tract, and vagina in about 12 days. Eosinophils can migrate back to blood and bone marrow. Eosinophils are motile and can migrate between the endothelial cells into tissue or area of inflammation. Eosinophils structure Granules of the eosinophils contain hydrolytic enzymes like: Peroxidase. Acid phosphatase. Aryl sulfatase. β-glucuronidase. Phospholipase. Cathepsin. Ribonuclease. But eosinophils lake the enzymes like: Alkaline phosphatase. Lysosomes. Cationic proteins. There are tissue eosinophils, and these have prominent nucleoli. Immunocytes: Lymphocytes are of two types: B – lymphocytes give rise to antibody-dependent immunity. T – lymphocytes give cell-mediated immunity; their subtypes are: T – cytotoxic cell. (T – killer). T – suppressor cell. T – helper cell. The primary function of T–cells is to fight chronic bacterial and viral infections.

A multitude of pathways may be invoked to activate of the complement system. The classic pathway requires the adaptive immune system because it requires antibody. The alternative pathway is activated in multiple ways but does not require antibody for activation. A third pathway is called the mannan-binding lectin pathway. This last pathway requires the binding of mannan-binding lectin to specific polysaccharides, which subsequently activates proteases and the complement system. Previous Adaptive Immune System Key components and antigen-receptor interaction The adaptive immune system is composed of T and B lymphocytes. Lymphocytes constitute 40% of circulating WBCs. B cells make up 10-20% of lymphocytes, T cells account for 70-75%, and NK cells comprise 10-15%. They are considered in the context of the innate immune system above. The cornerstone of adaptive immunity is antigen-receptor interaction. The B cell expresses surface antibody or Ig, which serves as an antigen receptor. T cells express antigen receptors. Genes for Ig and T-cell receptor (TCR) are rearranged in developing B and T cells, respectively. The variable (V), diversity (D), and junctional (J) gene recombinations are responsible for the nearly 1012 specific receptors generated for each cell type. Recombination events of gene segments and other processes, such as the addition of nucleotides at splicing junctions and somatic hypermutation (in B-cell development), aid in diversification. The receptors created are specific for particular antigens. B cells and their products constitute one arm of the adaptive immune system. B cells arise from hematopoietic stem-cell precursors in the bone marrow and must undergo 2 phases of maturation: an antigen-independent phase and an antigen-dependent phase. A common lymphoid progenitor gives rise to progenitor B cells (proB cells), which are the earliest identifiable cells committed to development in the B-cell lineage. These proB cells rearrange their Ig heavy-chain genetic segments to create a functional IgH gene that is then expressed as a pre–B-cell receptor. Once a functional pre–B-cell receptor is present, the Ig light-chain genetic segments can rearrange and be expressed with the already rearranged heavy chain. This immature B cell may then populate secondary lymphoid organs and undergo antigen-dependent maturation, which requires antigen encounter and T-cell support. The result is the creation of Ig-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. B cells express CD19, CD20, and CD21. An environmental milieu composed of activated CD4+ T cells and cytokines regulates class-switch recombination and isotype switching. The serum Igs produced make up 30% of serum proteins. The antibodies that B cells express function as opsonins and antitoxins. They also neutralize viral pathogens, agglutinate and lyse bacteria, and participate in ADCC. Types and subtypes of Ig Five types of Igs are recognized: IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE. IgG is the most abundant antibody class. It has antitoxin, antiviral, and antibacterial functions. It makes up 80% of the total Ig concentration and is evenly divided between extravascular tissues and the circulation. IgG has a half-life of 20-25 days. It is the primary component of intravenous (IV) Ig (IVIG) used clinically. IgG crosses the placenta and has 4 subclasses: IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. IgG is involved in little direct killing of targets but does activate the complement system and is involved in opsonization and ADCC. The presence of IgG after an initial response to antigen is associated with immunologic memory. IgM is the first antibody formed after antigen stimulation. It is present as a pentamer with a joining, or J, chain. It makes up 5% of the total Ig and is mostly found in the circulation. It functions as an antipolysaccharide, an opsonin, which is an activator of complement and rheumatoid factor. IgM plays a key role"

The whole blood in EDTA is stable for 24 hours at 23° C and 48 hours at 4 °C. Don’t use heparin. Indications for White Blood Cells This is the routine test in CBC. TLC differentiates acute and chronic infections. TLC diagnoses leukemias. TLC is done as a follow-up test in patients on chemotherapy. This will help a patient with an allergy. Precautions for White Blood Cells: Physical activity and stress may cause an increase in WBCs and differential values. Pregnancy in the final months may cause an increase in WBC count. Patients with splenectomy have a persistent mild increase in the WBC count. Drugs that may increase the WBC county are: Aspirin. Allopurinol. Steroids. Quinine. Epinephrine. Adrenaline. Chloroform. Heparin. Drugs that will decrease the WBC count: Antibiotics. Anticonvulsant. Antimetabolites. Antithyroid drugs. Diuretics. Sulfonamides. Barbiturates. Chemotherapy. Pathophysiology of White Blood Cells Definition of hematopoiesis: This is the dynamic process of blood cell production and development of the various cells of the blood. All these cells develop from the totipotent stem cells. This hematopoiesis is characterized by the constant turnover of the blood cells. The normal hematopoietic system maintains a cell population of erythrocytes, white blood cells, and platelets through a complex network of tissues, stem cells, organs, and regulatory factors. Functions of the hematopoietic components (cells): It transports oxygen and excretes CO2 through RBCs. It fights infection by the WBCs. It performs the immune function (cellular and humoral immunity) through the lymphocytes. It maintains (hemostasis) the bleeding and the clotting process through the platelets. Development of myeloid (myelopoiesis) /erythroid (erythropoiesis) cells: In the first few weeks of gestation, the yolk sac (mesoderm) is the hematopoiesis’s main site. The first stem cells for hemopoiesis are observed in the dorsal aorta, called an aorta-gonads-mesonephros region. These common precursors of endothelial and hematopoietic cells will seed the bone marrow, liver, and spleen from 6 weeks until 7 months of fetal life. The liver and the spleen are the major hematopoietic organs and produce blood cells until around 2 weeks after birth. During childhood and adulthood, marrow is the only source of new blood cells. In adult life, the marrow consists of approximately 50% of the fats. After 4 years of age, fat cells start appearing in the long bones. 18 to 20 years, hematopoiesis is only found in the sternum, ribs, pelvis, vertebra, and skull. After 40 years, the sternum, ribs, vertebra, and pelvis comprise 50% fat and 50% hematopoietic tissue. Hematopoiesis in fetus Bone marrow activity: Bone marrow hematopoietic activity is divided into two pools: Stem cells pool. Bone marrow pool. Eventually, these cells get mature and are released into the peripheral blood. Hematopoiesis (Bone marrow) Hematopoiesis: Hematopoiesis starts from the pluripotential stem cells. Hematopoietic stem cells are rare; these are 1 in every 20 million nucleated cells. There is self-renewal of the stem cells. So the bone marrow cellularity remains constant in a normal healthy person. There is an amplification of the stem cells, and one stem cell can produce about 106 mature blood cells after 20 subdivisions. There is various type of stem cells, and these cells develop from the totipotent cells. Totipotent cells, also called embryonic stem cells and gave rise to: Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to myeloid and lymphoid cells. Epithelial stem cells give rise to organs like the liver etc. Mesenchymal stem cells give rise to muscles, tendons, and cartilage. Neural stem cells give rise to neural tissue. Differentiation of stem cell These parent stem cells have CD34+ and CD38– and have the appearance of small, medium-sized lymphocytes. These stem cells give rise to committed stem cells, and this process takes place under the influence of CFU (colony-forming unit). This whole process is shown in the following diagram. Maturation of all bone marrow hematopoietic cells White blood cells or leukocytes are divided into : Granulocytic series. These cells contain granules in their cytoplasm. Because of a multilobate nucleus, these are also called polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Polys or PMN). These are of the following type: Neutrophils. Eosinophils. Basophils. Agranulocytic series is without any granules in their cytoplasm. These are also called mononuclear cells. These are : Lymphocytes. Monocytes. Platelets. White blood cells maturation White blood cells can also be divided into: Phagocytic cells: Neutrophils (polymorphonuclear leucocytes, PMN). Eosinophils. Basophils. Monocytes. Immunocytic cells: Lymphocytes. Lymphocytes precursors. The Polys and lymphocytes comprise 75% to 90% of the total WBC count. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN): The neutrophils develop from the myeloblast, transforming into promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band forms, and neutrophils delivered into the peripheral blood. WBC maturation cycle The development of the neutrophils: These are also called segmented neutrophils or polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). The neutrophils are of two types: Segmented neutrophils are found in the peripheral blood. Tissue neutrophils have ample cytoplasm having irregular, blunt pseudopodia that are often multi-pointed and may have hazy cytoplasmic streamers. These cells are not phagocytic and seldom have cytoplasmic vacuoles. The cytoplasm stains light blue and has a fine latticelike structure. Granules vary in number and stain, which will be red to blue. These cells have large, round, or oval nuclei with coarse chromatin. Nucleoli are conspicuous and stain light blue. The cytokines involved are: Growth factors/cytokines Target cells GM-CSF (Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor Neutrophils Eosinophils Monocytes M-CSF (Monocyte-macrophage CSF) Mononuclear phagocytic system IL-3 The precursor of: Neutrophils Monocyte Eosinophil Basophil Platelets Stem cells IL-7 Early granulocytes IL-8 Neutrophils Basophils T-lymphocytes The leukocytes’ total lifespan is 13 to 20 days, and they are produced in 7 to 14 days from the myeloblastic cells. Their life in the peripheral blood is just 7 to 10 hours and migrates to the tissue and is replenished by other cells released from the marrow. The polys have a characteristic dense nucleus consisting of 2 to 5 lobes and pale cytoplasm, with many fine pink-blue (azurophilic granules) or grey-blue granules. These granules are present in the lysosomes. White blood cells granules are divided into: Primary granules appear at the promyelocytic stage. These contain myeloperoxidase, acid phosphatase, and other hydrolases. Secondary (specific) granules appear at the myelocytic stage and predominate in the mature neutrophils. These granules contain collagenase, lactoferrin, and lysozyme. The role of the lysosomal enzyme in the destruction of the bacteria by the neutrophils are: Bacteria are phagocytosed into cells and fuse with the primary lysosomes to form a phagosome. Primary granules attack the bacteria. Secondary granules fuse with the phagosomes, and secondary enzymes attack the bacteria. Activated oxygen generated by glucose metabolism will kill the bacteria. Undigested, killed residual bacterial products are excreted by exocytosis. White blood cells’ Role in Bacterial Infection The function of Poly (PMN) is: The poly (PMN) gives immunity by fighting against infections and reacting against foreign bodies by various methods: Phagocytosis is the killing and digestion of bacteria. Eosinophils are involved in allergic reactions. Eosinophils have a role in parasitic infestation. Basophils of the peripheral blood are also rich in histamine granules; they play a role in allergic reactions. Monocytic cells have the property of phagocytosis. They can kill bacteria and remove debris. Monocytes produced interferon. They have a longer life than neutrophils. Summary of the difference between various types of granulocytic series (neutrophils) cells: Characteristics Myeloblast Promyelocyte Myelocyte Metamyelocyte Band form Neutrophil Size of the cell 10 to 20 µm 10 to 20 µm 10 to 18 µm 10 to 18 µm 10 to 16 µm 10 to 16 µm Nuclear shape Round Round Oval or round Kidney shape Elongated Horseshoe shape 2 to 5 nuclear lobes N/C ratio 4:1 3:1 2:1 to 1:1 1:1 1:1 1:1 Nucleoli number 1 to 3 1 to 2 +/- None None None Nuclear chromatin and color Light reddish-blue no aggregation of material Light reddish-blue, fine meshwork Slight aggregation may be seen at the nuclear membrane. Light reddish-blue Fine chromatin, light aggregation, or granular pattern Light blue-purple with basophilic chromatin Purplish-red Clumped granular pattern. Purplish-red Clumped granular pattern. Cytoplasmic granules Absent Present fine azurophilic Non-specific granules Present, fine azurophilic, Specific granules Present, fine azurophilic Specific and neutrophilic Specific granules Fine violet-pink Specific granules, Fine violet-pink Amount of cytoplasm Basophilic and slight Basophilic and increased Bluish-pink and moderate Clear-pink and moderate Pink-abundant Pink-abundant Monocytes: Monocytes develop from the monoblast in the bone marrow. These macrophagic cells measure 25 to 80 µm with round or reniform nuclei and contain one or two nucleoli. There is clumped chromatin, abundant cytoplasm with vacuoles, and numerous azurophilic granules. These monocytes enter the circulation for a short time and then migrate to the tissue and transform into tissue macrophagic cells. Monocytes are also called histiocytes which means histio = tissue and cyte= cells. Monocytes in the peripheral blood smear When these monocytes are mature, they become too large to pass readily through the capillaries, so these settle in the tissue and convert into tissue macrophages in many organs like: In the lungs are called pulmonary alveolar macrophages. In the peritoneum are called peritoneal macrophages. In the spleen are called splenic macrophages. In the liver are called Kupffer’s cells. In the connective tissue are called tissue macrophages. These are also phagocytic cells. Monocytes don’t enter the circulation but can go back to circulation in case of inflammation. The function of monocytes: Their function as phagocytosis is similar to neutrophils. Monocytes can produce more rapidly than neutrophils and spend a longer time than neutrophils. Basophils: These cells all pass through the same stages as the neutrophils. These are also called mast cells when present in the tissue. The cells have large basophilic granules. The maturation of the basophils in the bone marrow takes more than 7 days. Basophils circulate in the peripheral blood for a few hours, then migrate to the tissue, skin, mucosa, and serosal surfaces. Morphology of the Basophil Eosinophils: Eosinophils spend 3 to 6 days developing in the bone marrow before appearing in the peripheral blood. These are stored in the bone marrow and released to the peripheral blood circulation when needed. The mean time in the circulation is about 8 hours. Eosinophils migrate from blood to bronchial mucosa, skin, GI tract, and vagina in about 12 days. Eosinophils can migrate back to blood and bone marrow. Eosinophils are motile and can migrate between the endothelial cells into tissue or area of inflammation. Eosinophils structure Granules of the eosinophils contain hydrolytic enzymes like: Peroxidase. Acid phosphatase. Aryl sulfatase. β-glucuronidase. Phospholipase. Cathepsin. Ribonuclease. But eosinophils lake the enzymes like: Alkaline phosphatase. Lysosomes. Cationic proteins. There are tissue eosinophils, and these have prominent nucleoli. Immunocytes: Lymphocytes are of two types: B – lymphocytes give rise to antibody-dependent immunity. T – lymphocytes give cell-mediated immunity; their subtypes are: T – cytotoxic cell. (T – killer). T – suppressor cell. T – helper cell. The primary function of T–cells is to fight chronic bacterial and viral infections.

It is known that in rheumatoid arthritis the patient's own immune cells, such as white blood cells, cause inflammation and inflict joint damage. This project aims to further understand the role that a type of white blood cell called neutrophils play in joint damage. Why is this research important? Neutrophils have been found to have both a positive and negative effect on joint damage. It is known that these white blood cells are responsible for much of the inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, when activated by antibodies found within the joint. However, it is also known that these antibodies can be eaten by the neutrophils, causing them to die, which reduces inflammation and promotes tissue healing. The researchers want to understand why the neutrophils in rheumatoid arthritis patients are less able to eat these antibodies found in the joint, compared to the neutrophils in healthy people. They also want to understand whether there is something special about the antibodies present in the joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, which make them resistant to being eaten. Most importantly, the researchers want to use this information to develop new drugs which can block the neutrophils’ ability to cause inflammation (the negative effect), but keep their ability to promote tissue healing (the positive effect). How will the finding benefit patients? This research will provide further understanding as to how neutrophils contribute to the inflammation experienced in rheumatoid arthritis. The understanding gained from this research could, in the future, result in the development of new and more effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, which inhibit inflammation and promote tissue healing in the joint.

Share it: White blood cells in the blood have the important purpose of protecting the body against infections, but also have a role in inflammation and allergic responses. There are various types of white blood cells and each of them can give us a lot of information around whether the infection or inflammatory response is bacterial, viral, auto-immune, allergic, acute or chronic. Different Types of White Blood Cells White blood cells make up approximately 1% of total blood volume in a healthy adult with a normal range of approximately 4 – 11 x 109/L. There are 5 types of white blood cells: NeutrophilsAccounts for approximately 50 – 70% of WBCs with a normal range of 2.5 – 7.5 x 109/LLymphocytesAccounts for approximately 20 – 40% of WBCs with a normal range of 1.0 – 3.0 x 109/LMonocytesAccounts for approximately 2 – 10% of WBCs with a normal range of 0.2 – 1.0 x 109/LEosinophilsAccounts for approximately 1 – 6% of WBCs with a normal range of 0.02 – 0.5 x 109/LBasophilsAccounts for approximately <1 – 2% of WBCs with a normal range of 0.02 – 0.1 x 109/L The easiest way to remember the order of these white blood cells from most abundant to least abundant within our body is to remember this simple phrase: Never – Neutrophils Let – Lymphocytes Monkeys – Monocytes Eat – Eosinophils Bananas – Basophils To remember the normal values of these different white blood cells? I just pick a number somewhere in the middle of the normal percentage range that forms a pattern that is easy to remember: 60% (Neutrophils), 30% (Lymphocytes), 6% (Monocytes), 3% (Eosinophils) and 1% (Basophils) White Blood Cells Reported as Percentages Versus Values As you can see from the two examples above, the total number of white blood cells are always reported as a number. However, the individual types of white blood cells may be reported as actual numbers (absolute count) and/or percentages (differential count). The actual number of each white blood cell is deduced from percentages because of one simple fact: an increased percentage of one type of white blood cell will always result in a decreased percentage of another type. So what does that mean? Let’s take a patient that has a total white blood cell count of 10 x 109/L with the following differential count breakdown: Neutrophil count is 60%Lymphocyte count is 30%Monocyte, eosinophil and basophil count combined are 10% Based on a total white blood cell count of 10 x 109/L, we can deduce from these percentages (differential count) the actual number (absolute count). Therefore, the patient in this example would have an absolute count of approximately: 6 x 109/L neutrophils3 x 109/L lymphocytes1 x 109/L monocytes, eosinophils and basophils combined The patient gets an infection and the total white blood cell count increases to 20 x 10^9/L with the following breakdown: Neutrophil count is 80% which would equate 16 x 10^9/LLymphocyte count is 15% which would equate 3 x 10^9/LMonocyte, eosinophil and basophil count is 5% which would equate 1 x 10^9/L The important thing to note here is that a decreased percentage for the lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils does not mean that the absolute count for each of these has decreased. It simply means that the increase in the total white blood cell count is attributed purely to a rise in the absolute count of the neutrophils. As each type of white blood cell is related to a specific type of process within the body, this understanding allows us to gain further supportive evidence for a patient’s presentation. The Function of Elevated White Blood Cells Types Neutrophils These white blood cells are the first responders in acute inflammatory processes and can be altered as a result of: Elevated Neutrophils Acute infectionsCocci, bacilli, fungi, viruses, parasitesAbscesses, tonsillitis, appendicitis, osteomyelitis, cholecystitis, meningitis, peritonitisNon-infectious inflammation Postoperative state, cardiopulmonary bypass, burns, trauma, acute asthma, myocardial infarction, acute gout, rheumatic fever, hypersensitivity reactionsMetabolic processes Diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, uraemia Decreased Neutrophils Severe, overwhelming infection in sepsis/septic shockCancer or chemotherapyAutoimmune disorders Let’s have a look at a standard bacterial infection with a rise in neutrophils: Lymphocytes These white blood cells consist of B cells, T cells and natural killer cells and can be altered as a result of: Elevated Lymphocytes Acute viral infectionsHepatitis, chickenpox, rubella, herpes, cytomegalovirus (CMV)Certain bacterial infectionsWhooping coughCancer Decreased Lymphocytes InfectionsHIV, tuberculosis, influenzaBone marrow damage and immune deficiencyAutoimmune disordersLupus, rheumatoid arthritis Let’s compare the previous results with a viral infection showing a rise in lymphocytes: Monocytes Usually elevated with chronic rather than acute infections, but can also be elevated due to: Chronic inflammatory diseasesParasitic infectionsViral infectionsAutoimmune disorders such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritisCancer Eosinophils Can be elevated due to: Allergic reactions such as hay feverAsthmaSkin inflammation such as eczema, dermatitisParasitic infectionsCancer Basophils Can be elevated as a result of: Rare allergic reactions such as hivesInflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitisCancer Let’s finally compare the previous two results with an allergic reaction showing a rise in eosinophils: So as you can see, each type of white blood cell will increase or decrease according to a specific process occurring within the body. By having an understanding of these relationships, we can get a lot more out of each white blood cell count we look at! References Coates, T. D. (2020). Approach to the patient with neutrophilia.

White blood cells (WBCs) are a type of cells found in blood. They form just 1% of your blood but are entrusted with the function of immunity. So, white blood cells circulate in the blood and help the immune system fight off microbes and infections caused by them. When the body identifies an intruder or an infection, it releases white blood cells to fight them. This often causes an inflammatory reaction. White blood cells are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow. In fact, 80 to 90% of white blood cells are stored in the bone marrow. Types and functions of white blood cells White blood cells can be broadly classified into granulocytes and agranulocytes, depending on the presence or absence of small protein granules in them. Granulocytes There are three types of granulocytes, namely: Basophils: These form less than 1% of the white blood cells in the body. The basophil number usually increases during an allergic reaction. Basophils produce chemicals like histamine to control the body’s immune response. Eosinophils: These white blood cells are primarily responsible for responding to parasitic infections but also play a role in the body’s general immune and inflammatory responses. They have also been found to attack and kill cancer cells. Neutrophils: These cells form the majority of white blood cells in the body. They are essentially scavengers that identify an infectious agent like bacteria or fungi and destroy them. Neutrophils form the first line of the body’s defence mechanism. Agranulocytes There are two types of agranulocytes. They are: Lymphocytes: These white blood cells produce substances called antibodies to fight against microbes and other harmful invaders. Lymphocytes are of three types: B cells: These cells produce antibodies to help the immune system fight infections in the body. They are also called B-lymphocytes. T cells: These white blood cells identify and attack infection-causing cells and remove them from the body. Natural killer cells: As the name suggests, natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that attack and kill viral and cancer cells. Monocytes: These cells form 2 to 8% of your total white blood cell count. These cells usually have a longer lifespan than other WBCs and are responsible for fighting off chronic infections. What is the normal count of white blood cells? The optimum white blood cells count in your body is an indicator that your immune system is functioning normally. The normal range of white blood cells is between 4,000 and 11,000/microlitre. The WBC count may vary depending on your age and gender. The count may be different in children and pregnant women. What do abnormal WBC counts indicate? Certain health conditions and diseases can give rise to abnormal white blood cell count. Depending on the disease, the WBC count can be higher or lower than normal. High white blood cell count When the body produces excessive amounts of WBCs, it is termed leucocytosis. If you have a high white blood cell count, it may be indicative of one of the following conditions: Allergic response (commonly seen in people with asthma and atopic dermatitis) Burns Trauma Heart attack Inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, eczema Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites or viruses Leukaemia Sometimes, undergoing a surgical procedure can also raise your WBC count temporarily. Low white blood cell count When the body produces fewer than normal white blood cells, the condition is called leucopenia. A few conditions that may cause leucopenia include: Autoimmune diseases like lupus HIV Bone marrow disorders Lymphoma Bone marrow damage due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy or toxin exposure Sepsis Vitamin B12 deficiency Wrapping it up It is important to understand what white blood cells (WBCs) are and their vital role in the immune system. The different types of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, have unique features and perform their function to ensure the body is protected from harmful invaders and substances. A healthy white blood cell count within the normal range is a good indicator of your immune system’s strength. However, if you observe any significant deviations from the normal count, you must seek immediate consultation from your doctor for further evaluation.

Understand what leukocytes are, the types of white blood cells, and the different white blood cell functions. Updated: 04/04/2022 Table of Contents What are Leukocytes?Leukocytes are cells found in the human body that help the body to fight off infection and also to prevent illness or injury. Leukocytes can sometimes be referred to as white blood cells. There are several different types of leukocytes, including neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. Each of the different types of leukocytes have their own unique function, ranging from fighting off parasites and bacteria to repairing damaged body tissues. The five types of leukocytes are found in different amounts and locations in the body, depending on their specific functions. Measuring the number of each type of leukocyte and comparing the number to normal ranges can tell doctors and other health care providers numerous things about one's health. Leukocytes are important for numerous reasons, and their counterparts, red blood cells, work alongside them to help the blood serve its integral function to the human body system. Leukocytes are formed at different times and locations in the body. The bone marrow, however, is a common place for leukocyte development. An error occurred trying to load this video.

On the left is a red blood cell, center a platelet, and right a T-lymphocyte, a type of leukocyte White Blood Cell Functions to protect the body and repair it as well. White blood cells, or leukocytes, are a main component of the body's immune system. They circulate the body in the blood stream searching for foreign bodies to identify and potentially launch an attack on. Oftentimes they will coordinate a joint attack and produce antibody proteins that will attack any type of foreign body. The specific functions of the different types of white blood cells will be covered in more detail in the following sections.Types of White Blood CellsThere are several types of white blood cells, each with its own distinct function. The five main types of white blood cells are neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes. Interestingly enough, white blood cells are actually clear in color, with a slight purple or pinkish hue when viewed under a light microscope.NeutrophilsNeutrophils are a type of white blood cell that help the body by providing protection from foreign bodies, including bacteria and fungi. These types of white blood cells are the most numerous out of all of the leukocytes in the body. They are also the first line of defense for the body's immune system. Furthermore, these cells are the main component of the bodily fluid known as pus. While these cells only live for a short period of time after they are released from bone marrow, they certainly play an integral role.EosinophilsEosinophils are white blood cells that are responsible for the identification and usually the destruction of cancer cells, bacteria cells and other parasites. Additionally, these cells are responsible for triggering allergic reactions to foreign bodies, such as pollen. They account for a very small percent of white blood cells in the bloodstream, but are often found at a much higher frequency in the digestive system.Basophils are a type of white blood cell that are most well known for their role in signaling when infectious agents invade the body. In doing this, they often secret a compound called histamine, which results in inflammation and sometimes narrowing of the airways. This is often associated with conditions like asthma. A basophil cell is shown here, and is dyed with Wright stain to show its features more clearly LymphocytesLymphocytes are a category of white blood cells that includes two forms of cells that aid the immune system. They provide specific responses to invasion of infection, unlike most other white blood cell types that often provide nonspecific responses. B cells are a type of lymphocyte that mark invaders so that other types of leukocytes can recognize and attack them. B cells are often associated with antibodies. T cells, conversely, are responsible for the recognition and destruction of foreign bodies. So called ""memory"" T cells will remember these invaders in the future for a faster, more efficient immune response.MonocytesMonocytes are a type of white blood cell that act as the waste disposal system for the body. Monocytes often clean up dead cells that are left behind. Additionally, macrophages can form from monocytes. Macrophages are cells that can live in different tissue in the body, present invaders to other leukocytes, ingest and kill invaders as well as remove dead cells from infection sites.Lesson SummaryThe body's immune system is a very complex one and has many different types of white blood cells, or leukocytes. Leukocytes are cells found in the human body that help the body to fight off infection and also to prevent illness or injury. There are several types of leukocytes, and each one plays a unique role. Oftentimes, these cells work in conjunction with one another to aid the body in its defense of foreign invaders. The five main types of leukocytes and their functions are: Neutrophils - a type of white blood cell that helps the body by providing protection from foreign bodies, including bacteria and fungi. These are found in the largest quantity in the body. Eosinophils - white blood cells that are responsible for the identification and usually the destruction of cancer cells, bacteria cells and other parasites. Basophils - a type of white blood cell that is most well known for their role in signaling when infectious agents invade the body. Lymphocytes - a category of white blood cells that includes two forms of cells that aid the immune system. B cells are unique in their role in marking invaders so other leukocytes can recognize them for attack. Monocytes - a type of white blood cell that acts as the waste disposal system for the body. These cells are not the only components of the immune system, but are rather important in their own right. Another cell, called a , is a type of cell that can live in different tissue in the body, present invaders to other leukocytes, ingest and kill invaders as well as remove dead cells from infection sites. All in all, the body's immune system is a very intricate system that works with the body's other systems to insure the health and safety of the entire human body.

An elevated leukocyte count can be caused by a disease like leukemia, or lymphoma. Additionally, pregnancy can trigger a high white blood cell count. White blood cells can also be elevated from autoimmune diseases or from conditions like asthma. What does it mean when the white blood cell count is low? A low white blood cell count can mean a variety of different conditions are present. The body may be fighting a severe infection, or be under attack by a cancer that can affect the bone marrow. Additionally, an autoimmune disease like lupus, may be the culprit. What does it mean when there are leukocytes in the urine? Leukocytes found in too high levels in the urine may be a result of the body fighting off an infection, most likely in the urinary tract. Doctors can prescribe antibiotics to combat this. How is white blood cell count increased? White blood cells are produced normally in the bone marrow. The cells are produced normally by the body to be ready for any invasion or infections. The production of these cells will increase if an invasion occurs, or if cells like basophils release histamines to trigger a response from the immune system.

White blood cells (WBCs) are a type of cells found in blood. They form just 1% of your blood but are entrusted with the function of immunity. So, white blood cells circulate in the blood and help the immune system fight off microbes and infections caused by them. When the body identifies an intruder or an infection, it releases white blood cells to fight them. This often causes an inflammatory reaction. White blood cells are produced by stem cells in the bone marrow. In fact, 80 to 90% of white blood cells are stored in the bone marrow. Types and functions of white blood cells White blood cells can be broadly classified into granulocytes and agranulocytes, depending on the presence or absence of small protein granules in them. Granulocytes There are three types of granulocytes, namely: Basophils: These form less than 1% of the white blood cells in the body. The basophil number usually increases during an allergic reaction. Basophils produce chemicals like histamine to control the body’s immune response. Eosinophils: These white blood cells are primarily responsible for responding to parasitic infections but also play a role in the body’s general immune and inflammatory responses. They have also been found to attack and kill cancer cells. Neutrophils: These cells form the majority of white blood cells in the body. They are essentially scavengers that identify an infectious agent like bacteria or fungi and destroy them. Neutrophils form the first line of the body’s defence mechanism. Agranulocytes There are two types of agranulocytes. They are: Lymphocytes: These white blood cells produce substances called antibodies to fight against microbes and other harmful invaders. Lymphocytes are of three types: B cells: These cells produce antibodies to help the immune system fight infections in the body. They are also called B-lymphocytes. T cells: These white blood cells identify and attack infection-causing cells and remove them from the body. Natural killer cells: As the name suggests, natural killer cells are a type of white blood cell that attack and kill viral and cancer cells. Monocytes: These cells form 2 to 8% of your total white blood cell count. These cells usually have a longer lifespan than other WBCs and are responsible for fighting off chronic infections. What is the normal count of white blood cells? The optimum white blood cells count in your body is an indicator that your immune system is functioning normally. The normal range of white blood cells is between 4,000 and 11,000/microlitre. The WBC count may vary depending on your age and gender. The count may be different in children and pregnant women. What do abnormal WBC counts indicate? Certain health conditions and diseases can give rise to abnormal white blood cell count. Depending on the disease, the WBC count can be higher or lower than normal. High white blood cell count When the body produces excessive amounts of WBCs, it is termed leucocytosis. If you have a high white blood cell count, it may be indicative of one of the following conditions: Allergic response (commonly seen in people with asthma and atopic dermatitis) Burns Trauma Heart attack Inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, IBD, eczema Infections caused by bacteria, fungi, parasites or viruses Leukaemia Sometimes, undergoing a surgical procedure can also raise your WBC count temporarily. Low white blood cell count When the body produces fewer than normal white blood cells, the condition is called leucopenia. A few conditions that may cause leucopenia include: Autoimmune diseases like lupus HIV Bone marrow disorders Lymphoma Bone marrow damage due to chemotherapy, radiation therapy or toxin exposure Sepsis Vitamin B12 deficiency Wrapping it up It is important to understand what white blood cells (WBCs) are and their vital role in the immune system. The different types of white blood cells, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, have unique features and perform their function to ensure the body is protected from harmful invaders and substances. A healthy white blood cell count within the normal range is a good indicator of your immune system’s strength.

The primary job of white blood cells (WBCs), sometimes called leukocytes, is to help fight invaders, such as bacteria and viruses.It all begins inside the bones where there is a red, spongy area known as the marrow. This is where pre-existing cells divide and specialize to become the blood. Stem cells in the bone marrow can produce red blood cells (RBCs), platelets, or a variety of WBCs. What is a White Blood Cell?A sample of blood, even one as small as a drop, looks red. If you take that sample of blood, place it in a small tube, and spin it very fast for several minutes, you will see three layers. The bottom later has a deep red color and consists primarily of red blood cells, comprising about 45% of the total volume. The top layer is the golden-colored plasma, which is about 54% of the total volume. Plasma is a complex solution of water, salts, wastes, vitamins, proteins, fats, sugars, etc.The remaining 1% of the blood is seen as a thin, murky, white middle layer between the red blood cells below and the plasma above. This narrow band consists mainly of platelets and WBCs.WBCs are not white at all, but the white appearance of this layer explains the name given to this cell type. To understand white blood cells further, we look at them using a microscope with special stains as the cells are laid out (smeared) on a glass slide. When you have a complete blood count or a WBC with a “differential,” the cells can be identified under a microscope and counted. What are the Types of White Blood Cells?There are three main types of WBCs – granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes. GranulocytesGranulocytes include basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils, categorized this way because of their color and the presence of tiny granules seen when the sample is stained in the laboratory: Basophils are the smallest in number, and account for 0-2% of the total number of WBCs. Their granules contain histamine, which is a potent chemical in allergic reactions. They also contain heparin, a chemical that prevents the clotting of blood. Basophils are a first line of defense as they engulf and destroy infectious organisms.Eosinophils are more numerous, making up 0-8% of the total. Their granules contain proteins that can kill bacteria and parasites. These proteins also play a role in inflammation, a common bodily reaction to illness or injury.Neutrophils are the most numerous of all the WBCs, comprising 40% to 80% of the total number of WBCs. Their granules contain a potent enzyme that directly attacks bacteria. Interestingly, neutrophils also have cell projections that can lay down “traps” to snare infectious organisms and devour them.LymphocytesLymphocytes are quite common among the WBCs, comprising 15-49% of the total number. There are two groups of lymphocytes including B-cells and T-cells. Unlike the other immune cells, the B-cells and T-cells can adapt to new infections and help the immune system fight infections. They also play a vital role in remembering previous infections. And some types of T-cells naturally kill cancerous cells that grow in the body as well.MonocytesMonocytes are the largest cells in the blood stream, making up 0-13% of the total number of WBCs. They too can engulf and devour infectious cells, but they can also help to repair the surrounding body cells that have been damaged by the infection. In addition to devouring invading cells, monocytes display fragments of the dead cells to the outside to help the lymphocytes “learn” more about the infecting cells.What Do White Blood Cells Do?As soon as an invader – or pathogen – enters the body, the immune system begins a race to expel the pathogens before they become too numerous. The WBCs respond by multiplying rapidly as well. The change in the numbers of WBCs usually signals that the immune system is responding to the bacteria, viruses, fungi, or parasites that have entered the body.Some of these pathogens can quickly overwhelm the body’s defenses. If that happens, the lymphocytes can then mount a specific response that is very effective at destroying these infection-causing organisms or even providing a more rapid response when a second infection occurs, sometimes even decades after the first.What Are the Tests for White Blood Cells?WBCs are usually measured as part of a simple blood test called a complete blood count, commonly called a CBC. The part of the CBC that looks at the WBCs measures both the number of WBCs as well as the breakdown for each type of WBC type and that is called the “differential.”Why Do People With Cancer Have White Blood Cells Monitored?A blood test measuring WBCs may be used to identify types and stages of blood cancers, like leukemia. In addition, checking WBCs can help to detect any infections and their severity.Patient Power asked George D Lundberg, MD, a leading academic pathologist, medical journalist, and current Editor in Chief of , to explain more about WBCs and cancer.Dr. Lundberg said that “cancer treatment itself, such as radiation or chemotherapy, often disturbs the WBCs, perhaps lowering them a lot. That makes a patient less capable of resisting infections.” As a result, it is important to keep track of WBC levels to measure the response to cancer treatment as well as to monitor the risk of infection.Normal White Blood Cell CountsWhat are expected WBC values? Dr. Lundberg explained that “so-called ‘normal’ is a statistical reference range determined by testing large numbers of individuals. Each person is an individual and may carry different, but consistent, numbers over a lifetime. But most lab results offer a “range” of normal results. Typically, a WBC count groups all the types together with one number, with the total ranging from about 4,000-11,000/microliter of blood. A ""differential"" breaks these WBCs down by the percentage of each type seen.When Should People With Cancer be Concerned About WBC Results?Dr. Lundberg said that, with any cancer, concern is reasonable when WBC numbers change substantially (either higher or lower), from a person’s usual counts. That’s why it is vital to be in touch with your physician about your own personal results. He added that, “since blood cancers involve the white cells and may involve the red cells as part of the cancer, the ups and downs of numbers vary all over the place, depending on blood cancer types and stages. This may reflect good or bad news, on a case-to-case basis.”Notes: This article was originally published February 23, 2023 and most recently updated February 27, 2023.ShareSusan Yox is a nurse and health educator who has worked as a writer, editor, and most recently, as Director of Editorial Content at Medscape, a website for physicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals.In addition to a BS and MS in nursing, she holds a doctorate in Health Behavioral Sciences.Susan writes for health professionals and consumers, often focusing on infectious diseases, public health, oncology, and nursing.Dr. Pankit Vachhani is an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

White blood cells (WBCs), also called leukocytes, are the cells of the immune system that protect the body against infectious disease, allergens, and other foreign invaders. The number of white blood cells in the can often tell the health care provider if a disease is present. The normal number of white blood cells is usually between 4,000–11,000 cells per microliter of blood. Having more WBCs in the blood than normal is called leukocytosis, and having fewer WBCS than normal is called leukopenia. There are many types of white blood cells, each with very specific jobs: Neutrophils are the most common WBC. Around 60-70% of circulating leukocytes are neutrophils. These cells defend the body against or infection by digesting bacteria in a process called phagocytosis. Eosinophils are fewer in number, but have an important role in allergic reactions and other functions. Only about 2-4% of WBCs are eosinophils, but that number rises in response to allergies, parasites, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and in certain diseases of the spleen and central nervous system. Basophils respond to allergens and other invaders by releasing two chemicals that aid in the body’s defenses: histamine and heparin. Histamine is responsible for widening blood vessels and increasing the flow of blood to injured tissue, whereas heparin is an anticoagulant that prevents blood clotting. B cells make that can bind to, and enhance their destruction. T cells come in 3 types: helper cells, cytotoxic cells and natural killer cells. Together, they help coordinate the immune response and maintain immune system integrity. Monocytes not only share the infection-eating function of neutrophils, but also present pieces of disease-carrying bacteria and other organisms to T cells so that the they may be killed. What are common white blood cell disorders? Two major types of white blood cell disorders are proliferative disorders and leukopenias. In the proliferative disorders, there is an increase in the number of white blood cells. This increase is commonly a reaction due to infection, but may, less commonly, be related to some types of cancer. In leukopenias, there is a decrease in the number of white blood cells, which can be caused by cells being destroyed by an illness or by other conditions. One particular kind of leukopenia is neutropenia, which means that there are fewer neutrophils in the blood. Outside causes of neutropenia include chemotherapy, medications, toxins, and viral illness. Disorders that can cause neutropenia within the body include defects in bone marrow (where all WBCs are created), or conditions in which a person is born with too few neutrophils. Both leukopenia and neutropenia can cause deficiency in the immune system, which can increase risk of infection. Treatment of leukopenia and neutropenia are aimed at the underlying cause of the change in cell counts. An increase in the number of white blood cells in circulation is called leukocytosis. Leukocytosis can be caused by inflammation and other disorders that result in increased bone marrow production (which leads to greater production of WBCS), too many WBCs being released from bone marrow all at once, or disorders that prevent WBCs from attaching to tissues and being absorbed by the body’s tissues. Our approach to white blood cell disorders All of the disorders discussed above have to do with the number of white blood cells. Other disorders include those in which the number of white blood cells is normal but the cells do not function normally. If white blood cells form abnormally, it can affect their ability to perform normal functions such as killing bacteria. Specialized testing is available through our center to further determine what the treatment will be.

Since then, both red and white blood cells have been of interest to researchers in the . Humans need enough white blood cells. A low count can be an indicator of diseases. It can be caused by medicine use; one of the side effects of Elmiron for example, is low levels of WBC. This side effect even led to . White blood cells (leukocytes) are cells that against diseases and foreign invaders. While they vary in size, they are generally the largest cell type found in the blood. White blood cells reside throughout the body, including in the lymphatic system and in the blood. They make up less than 1 percent of total blood volume. The lifespan of a white blood cell varies from 18 hours to many years. You might be interested in reading about or All white blood cells have nuclei, which makes them different from other blood cells. The five main types of blood cells are basophils, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. Basophils are the cells mainly responsible for allergic reactions. They defend against parasites and bacteria by excreting two chemicals: heparin and histamine. Heparin is a blood-thinning substance. Histamine widens blood vessels and increases blood flow to infected tissues. Basophils are not antigen specific. This means they don't have to determine the identity of the invading substance before taking action against it. Neutrophils mainly target bacteria and fungus. They are the most abundant type of white blood cell in most mammals. They usually respond and multiply quickly. Neutrophils are formed from stem cells in bone marrow. Eosinophils target larger parasites, such as worms, and modulate allergic inflammatory responses. For most individuals, eosinophils make up about 1 to 6 percent of all white blood cells. Monocytes are the largest type of white cell. There are at least three types of monocytes in human blood and they differentiate into macrophages, dendritic cells, and foam cells. Monocytes are produced by bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days prior to moving into tissues throughout the body. They make up about 3 to 8 percent of white cells. Lymphocytes work the front lines to identify and destroy foreign invaders. They are the main type of cell found in lymph, the fluid that circulates through the lymphatic system. There are three primary types of lymphocytes: B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. B cells make up 10 percent of the lymphocytes. They circulate in the front lines of our blood and work to identify foreign invaders. T cells make up 75 percent of lymphocytes. They mature in the thiamin, which is a part of the lymph system, and then migrate to the point of invasion. T cells surround, bind, and help kill foreign invaders. Natural killer cells function to defend against tumors and viruses. Source: , About the Author Bachelor's (BA/BS/Other) Julianne (@JuliChiaet) covers health and medicine for LabRoots.

With his theories of (1905) and (1915), Einstein overthrew many assumptions earlier physical theories, redefining in the process the fundamental concepts of , , , , and . Along with , relativity is central to modern . In particular, relativity provides the basis for understanding cosmic processes and the geometry of the itself.Explaining E = mc2“Special relativity” is limited to objects that are moving with respect to inertial frames of reference—i.e, in a state of with respect to one another such that an observer cannot, by purely mechanical experiments, distinguish one from the other. Beginning with the behaviour of light (and all other ), the theory of special relativity draws that are contrary to everyday experience but fully confirmed by experiments. Special relativity revealed that the speed of light is a limit that can be approached but not reached by any material object; it is the origin of the most famous equation in , E = mc2; and it has led to other tantalizing outcomes, such as the “.”“General relativity” is concerned with gravity, one of the fundamental forces in the universe. (The others are , the , and the .) Gravity defines macroscopic behaviour, and so general relativity describes large-scale physical phenomena such as planetary , the , , and the evolution of the universe.Special and general relativity have profoundly affected and human existence, most dramatically in applications of and . Additionally, relativity and its rethinking of the fundamental categories of space and time have provided a basis for certain philosophical, social, and artistic interpretations that have influenced human in different ways. Cosmology before relativity The mechanical universe Relativity changed the scientific of the universe, which began in efforts to grasp the behaviour of matter. In Renaissance times, the great Italian physicist moved beyond ’s philosophy to introduce the modern study of , which requires quantitative measurements of bodies moving in space and time. His and that of others led to basic concepts, such as , which is the distance a body covers in a given direction per unit time; acceleration, the rate of change of velocity; mass, the amount of material in a body; and , a push or pull on a body. Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. The next major stride occurred in the late 17th century, when the British scientific genius formulated his three famous , the first and second of which are of special concern in relativity. , known as the law of , states that a body that is not acted upon by external forces undergoes no acceleration—either remaining at rest or continuing to move in a straight line at constant speed. Newton’s second law states that a force applied to a body changes its velocity by producing an acceleration that is proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the body. In constructing his system, Newton also defined space and time, taking both to be absolutes that are unaffected by anything external. Time, he wrote, “flows equably,” while space “remains always similar and immovable.” Newton’s laws proved valid in every application, as in calculating the behaviour of falling bodies, but they also provided the framework for his landmark (the term, from the Latin gravis, or “heavy,” had been in use since at least the 16th century). Beginning with the (perhaps mythical) observation of a falling apple and then considering the as it orbits , Newton concluded that an invisible force acts between the and its planets. He formulated a comparatively simple mathematical expression for the gravitational force; it states that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that operates through empty space and that varies with the masses of the objects and the distance between them. The law of gravity was brilliantly successful in explaining the mechanism behind , which the German astronomer had formulated at the beginning of the 17th century. Newton’s mechanics and law of gravity, along with his assumptions about the nature of space and time, seemed wholly successful in explaining the of the universe, from motion on Earth to cosmic events. and the However, this success at explaining natural phenomena came to be tested from an unexpected direction—the behaviour of , whose intangible nature had puzzled philosophers and scientists for centuries. In 1865 the Scottish physicist showed that light is an electromagnetic wave with oscillating electrical and magnetic components. predicted that electromagnetic waves would travel through empty space at a speed of almost exactly 3 × 108 metres per second (186,000 miles per second)—i.e., according with the measured . Experiments soon confirmed the electromagnetic nature of light and established its speed as a fundamental of the universe. Maxwell’s remarkable result answered long-standing questions about light, but it raised another fundamental issue: if light is a moving , what medium supports it? Ocean waves and sound waves consist of the progressive oscillatory motion of molecules of water and of atmospheric gases, respectively. But what is it that vibrates to make a moving light wave? Or to put it another way, how does the energy embodied in light travel from point to point? For Maxwell and other scientists of the time, the answer was that light traveled in a medium called the (aether). Supposedly, this medium permeated all space without impeding the motion of planets and stars; yet it had to be more rigid than steel so that light waves could move through it at high speed, in the same way that a taut guitar string supports fast mechanical vibrations. Despite this contradiction, the idea of the seemed essential—until a definitive experiment disproved it. In 1887 the German-born American physicist and the American chemist made exquisitely precise measurements to determine how Earth’s motion through the ether affected the measured speed of light. In classical mechanics, Earth’s movement would add to or subtract from the measured speed of light waves, just as the speed of a ship would add to or subtract from the speed of ocean waves as measured from the ship. But the had an unexpected outcome, for the measured speed of light remained the same regardless of Earth’s motion. This could only mean that the ether had no meaning and that the behaviour of light could not be explained by classical physics. The explanation emerged, instead, from Einstein’s theory of special relativity."

Navstar-2F GPS satellite (Image credit: USAF) Jump to: Formulated by beginning in 1905, the explains the behavior of objects in space and time, and it can be used to predict things such as the existence of , light bending due to and the behavior of planets in their orbits.The theory is deceptively simple. First, there is no ""absolute"" frame of reference. Every time you measure an object's velocity, its momentum or how it experiences time, it's always in relation to something else. Second, the speed of light is the same no matter who measures it or how fast the person measuring it is going. Third, nothing can go faster than light.The implications of Einstein's most famous theory are profound. If the speed of light is always the same, it means that an astronaut going very fast relative to will measure the seconds ticking by more slowly than an Earthbound observer will. Time essentially slows down for the astronaut — a phenomenon called .Related: Any object in a big gravity field accelerates, so it also experiences time dilation. Meanwhile, the astronaut's spaceship experiences , which means that if you took a picture of the spacecraft as it flew by, it would look as though it were ""squished"" in the direction of motion. To the astronaut on board, however, all would seem normal. In addition, the mass of the spaceship would appear to increase from the point of view of people on Earth.But you don't necessarily need a spaceship to see relativistic effects. Indeed, there are several instances of relativity we can see in our daily lives and technologies we use today that demonstrate that Einstein was right. Here are some ways we see relativity in action.ElectromagnetsClose up of a worker holding an electromagnetic coil in an electromagnetics factory. (Image credit: Monty Rakusen via Getty Images) is a relativistic effect, and you can see this demonstrated via generators. If you take a loop of wire and move it through a magnetic field, you generate an electric current. The charged particles in the wire are affected by the changing , which forces some of them to move and creates the current.But now, picture the wire at rest and imagine the magnet is moving. In this case, the charged particles in the wire (the electrons and protons) aren't moving anymore, so the magnetic field shouldn't be affecting them. But it does, and a current still flows. This shows that there is no privileged frame of reference. Thomas Moore, a professor of physics at Pomona College in Claremont, California, uses the principle of relativity to demonstrate , which states that a changing magnetic field creates an electric current.""Since this is the core principle behind transformers and electric generators, anyone who uses electricity is experiencing the effects of relativity,"" Moore told Live Science.Electromagnets work via relativity as well. When a direct current of electric charge flows through a wire, electrons drift through the material. Ordinarily, the wire would seem electrically neutral, with no net positive or negative charge, because the wire has about the same number of protons (positive charges) and electrons (negative charges). But if you put another wire with a direct current next to it, the wires attract or repel each other, depending on the direction in which the current is moving, .Assuming the currents are moving in the same direction, the electrons in the second wire are motionless compared to the electrons in the first wire. (This assumes the currents are about the same strength.) Meanwhile, the protons in both wires are moving in comparison to the electrons in both wires. Because of the relativistic length contraction, they appear to be more closely spaced, so there's more positive charge than negative charge per length of wire. Because like charges repel, the two wires also repel.Currents in the opposite directions result in attraction, because compared to the first wire, the electrons in the other wire are more crowded, thus creating a net negative charge, . Meanwhile, the protons in the first wire are creating a net positive charge, and opposite charges attract. GPS navigationGPS navigation is a great example of a relativistic time dilation. (Image credit: BlackJack3D via Getty Images)For your car's to function as accurately as it does, satellites have to consider relativistic effects, according to . This is because even though satellites aren't moving anywhere close to the speed of light, they are still going pretty fast. The satellites are also sending signals to ground stations on Earth. These stations (and the GPS technology in a car or smartphone) are all experiencing higher accelerations due to gravity than the satellites in orbit.To get that pinpoint accuracy, the that are accurate to a few nanoseconds (billionths of a second). Because each satellite is 12,600 miles (20,300 kilometers) above Earth and moves at about 6,000 mph (10,000 km/h), there's that tacks on about 4 microseconds each day. Add in the effects of gravity, and the time dilation effect goes up to about 7 microseconds (millionths of a second).The difference is very real: If no relativistic effects were accounted for, a GPS unit that tells you it's a half mile (0.8 km) to the next gas station would be 5 miles (8 km) off after only one day, according to Physics Central.Gold's yellow color(Image credit: Jonathan Knowles via Getty Images)Most metals are shiny because the electrons in the jump from different energy levels, or ""orbitals."" Some photons that hit the metal get absorbed and reemitted, though at a longer wavelength. However, most visible light gets reflected. is a heavy , so the inner electrons move fast enough that the relativistic mass increase and the length contraction are significant, a from Heidelberg University in Germany. As a result, the electrons spin around the nucleus in shorter paths, with more momentum. Electrons in the inner orbitals carry energy that is closer to the energy of outer electrons, and the wavelengths that get absorbed and reflected are longer. Longer wavelengths of light mean that some of the visible light that would usually be reflected gets absorbed, and that light is on the blue end of the spectrum. White light is a , but in gold's case, when light gets absorbed and reemitted, the wavelengths are usually longer. That means the mix of light waves we see tends to have less blue and violet in it. Because yellow, orange and red light are longer wavelengths than blue light, gold appears yellowish, .Gold's resistance to corrosionGold is great for use in jewelry, although it's rare to find pure gold pieces. (Image credit: Peter Dazeley via Getty Images)The relativistic effect on gold's electrons is also one reason it doesn't corrode or easily react with anything else, in the journal .Gold has only one electron in its outer shell, but it still is not as reactive as calcium or lithium. Instead, because the electrons in gold are ""heavier"" than they should be, since they are moving near the speed of light, increasing their mass, they are held closer to the atomic nucleus. This means that the outermost electron isn't likely to be where it can react with anything at all; it's just as likely to be among the electrons that are close to the nucleus.Liquid mercuryMercury is used in LCD screens and monitors. (Image credit: Peter Cade via Getty Images)Mercury is also a heavy atom, with electrons held close to the nucleus because of their speed and consequent mass increase. The bonds between mercury atoms are weak, so mercury melts at lower temperatures and is typically a liquid when we see it, according to .Your old TVCathode ray tube used in an old analog oscilloscope in the lab. (Image credit: albln via Getty Images)Until about the early 2000s, most televisions and monitors had cathode ray tube screens. A cathode ray tube works by firing electrons at a phosphor surface with a big magnet. Each electron makes a lighted pixel when it hits the back of the screen, and the electrons fire out to make the picture move at up to 30% the speed of light. Relativistic effects are noticeable, and when manufacturers shaped the magnets, they had to consider those effects, .LightImage from the Hubble Space Telescope of the giant galaxy UGC 2885. (Image credit: NASA/ESAB. Holwerda (University of Louisville)) assumed that there is an absolute rest frame, or an external perfect frame of reference that we could compare all other frames of reference against. If he had been right, we would have to come up with a different explanation for light, because it wouldn't happen at all.""Not only would magnetism not exist, but light would also not exist, because relativity requires that changes in an electromagnetic field move at a finite speed instead of instantaneously,"" Moore said. ""If relativity did not enforce this requirement … changes in electric fields would be communicated instantaneously … instead of through electromagnetic waves, and both magnetism and light would be unnecessary.""The sunThis image from June 20, 2013, at 11:15 p.m. EDT shows the bright light of a solar flare on the left side of the Sun and an eruption of solar material shooting through the Sun's atmosphere, called a prominence eruption. (Image credit: NASA/SDO)Without Einstein's most famous equation — — the and the rest of the stars wouldn't shine. In the center of our parent star, intense and pressures constantly squeeze four separate hydrogen atoms into a single helium atom, according to . The mass of a single helium atom is just slightly less than that of four hydrogen atoms. What happens to the extra mass? It gets directly converted into energy, which shows up as sunlight on our planet.Additional resourcesLearn more about how , from NASA.See for particle accelerators, from Fermilab.Explore and its many confirmed predictions, from the European Space Agency.This article was updated on March 22, 2022, by Live Science contributor Adam Mann.

To break it down, Einstein proposed SR in 1905 to resolve experiments involving light with classical physics. Over the next ten years, Einstien would attempt to generalize the theory to explain how electromagnetism and classic mechanics could be resolved with gravity – which yielded GR. While Einstein’s insights would be confirmed within a few years, they continue to be tested and validated to this very day.

Credit: AP Photo As Einstein is credited with once saying, “If you can’t explain it to a six-year-old, you don’t understand it yourself.” But as noted already, doing that means getting into some history and advanced concepts – like universal gravitation, inertial reference frames, mass-energy equivalence, spacetime, etc. But with a little patience and dedication, the theory of Relativity is something that anyone is capable of understanding. Galileo and Newton The story of Relativity goes back to the 17th century and the work of famed Italian astronomer and polymath . In 1632, Galileo published , which many consider to be his magnum opus. In this work, Galileo explained in simple terms how the Heliocentric Model of the Universe (as described by Copernicus) resolved issues that the Geocentric Model could not explain. Among other things, Galileo explained why the Earth’s motion was not obvious to people on its surface. In keeping with his ability to convey complex ideas with simple and erudite logic, Galileo illustrated how this was possible using the metaphor of a ship at sea. In short, Galileo said that if a person standing on the deck were to drop a ball of wax into a vase of water, they would see the ball descend directly down to the bottom. This would apply regardless of whether the ship was in motion or not. The reason, he stated, is because the ball and everything aboard the ship is part of the ship’s inertial reference frame – i.e., it moves with it. The same, he argued, holds for a person standing on the surface of Earth as it moves: “Now these things take place in motion which is not natural, and in materials with which we can experiment also in a state of rest or moving in the opposite direction, yet we can discover no difference in the appearances, and it seems that our senses are deceived. “Then what can we be expected to detect as to the earth, which, whether it is in motion or at rest, has always been in the same state? And when is it that we are supposed to test by experiment whether there is any difference to be discovered among these events of local motion in their different states of motion and of rest, if the earth remains forever in one or the other of these two states?” Galileo Galilei displaying his telescope to Leonardo Donato. Credit: Wikimedia Commons However, to an observer on the shore, Galileo claimed that things would look quite different. If the person standing on the ship’s deck dropped the ball over the side, it would appear to them that it still fell straight down. But to the observer on the shore, it would look like it was following a parabolic path. To them, the ball’s motion would visibly be the result of motion imparted by the moving ship with the Earth’s gravitational pull. In short, the motion and velocity would be relative to the observer. This came to be known as Galilean Relativity (or Galilean Invariance), which came down to a single postulate: “[A]ny two observers moving at constant speed and direction with respect to one another will obtain the same results for all mechanical experiments.” In other words, the physical mechanics of a system are the same in all reference frames, provided the motion and velocity of the observers remain constant. However, if either of these parameters changes, then the mechanics will change (more on that later). The explanation would become a key argument used in defense of the Heliocentric Model. For Earth-based observers, the motions of the planets, the Sun, the Moon, and the stars were all relative to the observer (us). But when one cataloged the motions (and the relative size) of these objects in the night sky over time, they would see how these observations could only be explained by the motion of the Earth around the Sun (as well as the rotation of Earth itself) at a constant velocity. By 1687, Sir Isaac Newton would revolutionize our understanding of physics with his magnum opus, . In this tome, Newton synthesized Galileo’s theories on motion with his research into gravitation, which was summarized with his . These included: A body continues in its state of rest, or in uniform motion in a straight line, unless acted upon by a force.A body acted upon by a force moves in such a manner that the time rate of change of momentum equals the force.If two bodies exert forces on each other, these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. These three laws describe three physical constants that remain central to modern physics: Intertia, which states that bodies will remain in a state of motion unless an external force speeds them up or slows them down; Force, which can be summarized mathematically as the mass of an object multiplied by its acceleration (F=ma); and Action-Reaction, which establishes when an object exerts a force on another object, the second object exerts an equal and opposite on the first. This laid the groundwork for Newton’s , which states that all point sources with mass attract each other through gravitational force; and the , which states that this force is directly dependent on the masses of both objects and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. In short, Newton argued that the same force that caused the apple to fall from a tree (Newton’s Apple) causes the planets to orbit the Sun, the Moon to orbit Earth, and all other orbital mechanics in the Solar System. A consequence of Newton’s Universality was that scientists would henceforth see space and time as reference frames that were fixed and separate. Basically, an object’s position and motion could be described in terms of three dimensions in space – length, height, and depth (or the x, y, z axes) – and one dimension in time. This framework for understanding the Universe would become canon for the next two hundred years. Newton’s theories were so influential that the terms Classical Physics and Newtonian Physics (or Mechanics) would be used interchangeably. By the mid-to-late 19th century, new discoveries in the fields of astronomy, electromagnetism, and particle theory would knock these conventions on their ear. What had previously seemed like an orderly Universe consisting of space and time, matter and energy, and universal reference frames would be replaced by relativistic effects, time dilation, and “spooky action at a distance.” Electromagnetism By the mid-19th century, scientists had made multiple breakthroughs in the study of optics (light and colors) and (EM) phenomena. This led to the realization that light is a form of EM radiation and that its properties (how it behaves like a wave) were similar to the propagation of electrical current. Moreover, experiments performed by this time yielded highly-accurate estimates in the speed of light – 299,792,458 m/s (1.079 billion km/h; 670.6 million mph). In addition, the theoretical work of James Clerk Maxwell and Hendrik Lorentz established that electric and forces behaved as fields that exert force on point charges. These were summarized in (1861-62) and the (1895), which describe how and are generated by , , and changes of the fields. Together, these principles form the basis of classical electromagnetism, optics, and electric circuits. These experiments also yielded highly-accurate estimates for the speed of light – which is currently clocked at 299,792,458 m/s (1.079 billion km/h; 670.6 million mph). Unfortunately, these experiments also presented theoretical problems as far as Classical Physics was concerned. In all cases, the measured speed of light was constant, regardless of whether the source was moving relative to the observer or not. This contradicted a basic tenet of Classical Mechanics and Galilean Relativity. For example, Earth’s rotation on its axis essentially means that it is rotating towards the Sun. This means that when the Sun is in the east, the light reaching an observer would be approaching and therefore have a greater measured velocity than light observed from any other direction. However, experiments involving optics and the refraction of light, like those performed by Augustin Fresnel in 1818, showed no measurable change in the speed of light. The Mysterious “Aether” As a result, scientists began postulating by the early 19th century that space must be filled with some invisible “aether.” This medium, they argued, allowed light to propagate through space but also meant that light was dragged along by it – leading to a change in its velocity. This was exemplified by Fresnel’s , where he stated that the motion of the Earth does not have any influence on how light refracts because “the ether is partially carried along by the earth and light waves inside the optical medium are partially dragged along with the ether.” This is similar to how sound travels in air or water or ripples propagate across the surface of a pond. Alas, the experiments conducted throughout the 19th century continually indicated that the speed of light was constant. To resolve these theoretical issues with the experimental results, scientists needed to measure the effects of this aether to determine its properties. This required that scientists show that the measured speed of the light was a simple sum of its speed through the medium, plus the speed of the medium. Hippolyte Fizeau attempted to prove this with his “water tube experiment” (or ), which he conducted in 1851. After measuring the speed of light in moving water through tubes, Fizeau’s results indicated that light was being dragged along by the medium – the water. This appeared to confirm earlier experimental results, such as those conducted by Augustin Fresnel and Sir George Strokes. However, the magnitude of the effect that Fizeau observed was far lower than expected. Another famous example was the (1887) conducted by American physicists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley. Using a chamber and a series of mirrors, they attempted to measure the speed of light from different angles – a horizontal one corresponding to Earth’s rotation towards the Sun and a perpendicular one. If such an “aether” existed, then the Earth’s movement through it (and towards the Sun) would result in a noticeable difference with the horizontal beam. Once again, the experiment yielded negative results since there was no observable difference between the measured speeds of the light beams. At this point in the game, Einstein would come along and offer a brilliant insight, analysis, and synthesis of the theoretical and experimental data. This occurred in 1905 when Einstein first revealed what would be known as his Theory"
0,nature,General Relativity explained like you've never seen before,https://www.nature.com/articles/106782a0,"theory to the case of moving bodies was incompatible with the results of experiment.At this point, H. A. Lorentz came to the rescue. In view of his unqualified adherence to the atomic theory of matter, Lorentz felt unable to regard the latter as the seat of continuous electromagnetic fields. He thus conceived of these fields as being conditions of the æ, which was regarded as continuous. Lorentz considered the æ to be intrinsically independent of matter, both from a mechanical and a physical point of view. The æ did not take part in the motions of matter, and a reciprocity between æ and matter could be assumed only in so far as the latter was considered to be the carrier of attached electrical charges. The great value of the theory of Lorentz lay in the fact that the entire electrodynamics of bodies at rest and of bodies in motion was led back to Maxwell's equations of empty space. Not only did this theory surpass that of Hertz from the point of view of method, but with its aid H. A. Lorentz was also pre-eminently successful in explaining the experimental facts.The theory appeared to be unsatisfactory only in one point of fundamental importance. It appeared to give preference to one system of coordinates of a particular state of motion (at rest relative to the æ) as against all other systems of coordinates in motion with respect to this one. In this point the theory seemed to stand in direct opposition to classical mechanics, in which all inertial systems which are in uniform motion with respect to each other are equally justifiable as systems of co-ordinates (Special Principle of Relativity). In this connection, all experience also in, the realm of electro-dynamics (in particular Michelson's experiment) supported the idea of the equivalence of all inertial systems, i.e. was in favour of the special principle of relativity.The Special Theory of Relativity owes its origin to this difficulty, which, because of its fundamental nature, was felt to be intolerable. This theory originated as the answer to the question: Is the special principle of relativity really contradictory to the field equations of Maxwell for empty space? The answer to this question appeared to be in the affirmative. For if those equations are valid with reference to a system of co-ordinates K, and we introduce a new system of co-ordinates K′ in conformity with the—to all appearances readily establishable—equations of transformation K jxf=x -,~~y KGalileo transformation),? -? j Jthen Maxwell's field equations are no longer valid in the new co-ordinates (x′ y′, z′, t′). But appearances are deceptive. A more searching analysis of the physical significance of space and time rendered it evident that the Galileo transformation is founded on arbitrary assumptions, and in particular on the assumption that the statement of simultaneity has a meaning which is independent of the state of motion of the system of co-ordinates used. It was shown that the field equations for vacuo satisfy the special principle of relativity, provided we make use of the equations of transformation stated below:(Lorentz transformation).V? - v2lcIn these equations x, y, z represent the co-ordinates measured with measuring-rods which are at rest with reference to the system of co-ordinates, and t represents the time measured with suitably adjusted clocks of identical construction, which are in a state of rest.Now in order that the special principle of relativity may hold, it is necessary that all the equations of physics do not alter their form in the transition from one inertial system to another, when we make use of the Lorentz transformation for the calculation of this change. In the language of mathematics, all systems of equations that express physical laws must be co-variant with respect to the Lorentz transformation. Thus, from the point of view of method, the special principle of relativity is comparable to Carnot's principle of the impossibility of perpetual motion of the second kind, for, like the latter, it supplies us with a general condition which all natural laws must satisfy.Later, H. Minkowski found a particularly elegant and suggestive expression for this condition of co-variance, one which reveals a formal relationship between Euclidean geometry of three dimensions and the space-time continuum of physics. Euclidean Geometry of Three Dimensions. Corresponding to two neighbouring points in space, there exists a numerical measure (distance ds) which conforms to the equationds2=dx12+dx22+dx32.It is independent of the system of co-ordinates chosen, and can be measured with the unit measuring-rod.The permissible transformations are of such a character that the expression for ds2 is invariant, i.e. the linear orthogonal transformations are permissible.With respect to these transformations, the laws of Euclidean geometry are invariant. Special Theory of Relativity. Corresponding to two neighbouring points in space-time (point events), there exists a numerical measure (distance ds) which conforms to the equationds2=dx12+dx32+dx42.It is independent of the inertial system chosen, and can be measured with the unit measuring-rod and a standard clock. x1, x2, x3 are here rectangular co-ordinates, whilst 4=VTcf is the time multiplied by the imaginary unit and by he velocity of light.The permissible transformations are of such a character that the expression for ds2 is invariant, i.e. those linear orthogonal substitutions are permissible which maintain the semblance of reality of x2, x3, x4. These substitutions are the Lorentz transformations.With respect to these transformations, the laws of physics are invariant.From this it follows that, in respect of its rôle in the equations of physics, though not with regard to its physical significance, time is equivalent to the space co-ordinates (apart from the relations of reality). From this point of view, physics is, as it were, a Euclidean geometry of four dimensions, or, more correctly, a statics in a four-dimensional Euclidean continuum.The development of the special theory of relativity consists of two main steps, namely, the adaptation of the space-time ""metrics"" to Maxwell's electro-dynamics, and an adaptation of the rest of physics to that altered space-time ""metrics."" The first of these processes yields the relativity of simultaneity, the influence of motion on measuring-rods and clocks, a modification of kinematics, and in particular a new theorem of addition of velocities. The second process supplies us with a modification of Newton's law of motion for large velocities, together with information of fundamental importance on the nature of inertial mass.It was found that inertia is not a fundamental property of matter, nor, indeed, an irreducible magnitude, but a property of energy. If an amount of energy be given to a body, the inertial mass of the body increases by an amount E/c2, where c is the velocity of light in vacuo. On the other hand, a body of mass m is to be regarded as a store of energy of magnitude mc2.Furthermore, it was soon found impossible to link up the science of gravitation with the special theory of relativity in a natural manner. In this connection I was struck by the fact that the force of gravitation possesses a fundamental property, which distinguishes it from electro-magnetic forces. All bodies fall in a gravitational field with the same acceleration, or—what is only another formulation of the same fact—the gravitational and inertial masses of a body are numerically equal to each other. This numerical equality suggests identity in character. Can gravitation and inertia be identical? This question leads directly to the General Theory of Relativity. Is it not possible for me to regard the earth as free from rotation, if I conceive of the centrifugal force, which acts on all bodies at rest relatively to the earth, as being a ""real"" field of gravitation, or part of such a field? If this idea can be carried out, then we shall have proved in very truth the identity of gravitation and inertia. For the same property which is regarded as inertia from the point of view of a system not taking part in the rotation can be interpreted as gravitation when considered with respect to a system that shares the rotation. According to Newton, this interpretation is impossible, because by Newton's law the centrifugal field cannot be regarded as being produced by matter, and because in Newton's theory"

The main principle of special relativity is energy-mass equivalence. This is most famously illustrated with the formula e=mc^2, which states that energy and mass are proportional.

Einstein made use of many thought experiments in order to think through his ideas and explain them to others. In the case of special relativity, Einstein used the example of a moving train and two observers: one inside the train and one standing on the station platform as the train drove by.In his thought experiment, Einstein imagined the train was struck simultaneously by two bolts of lightning. One struck the front of the train car and one struck the back of the train car. According to the observer on the platform, three events happened simultaneously. First, the center of the train car drove past. Second, the first bolt of lightning struck the front of the train. And third, the second bolt of lightning struck the back of the train.

In fact, it is said that Newton's laws are simply an approximation of special relativity at everyday speeds. And special relativity is simply an approximation of general relativity in the absence of gravity. Classical physics assumed that clocks tick at the same speed regardless of their speed or location and that the length of a ruler and the mass of weight would be absolute. Einstein insisted that all of this (space, time, mass, and speed) was relative.Before Einstein's theory, results like the Michelson-Morely experiment could not adequately be explained. It seems impossible that light could travel at identical speeds even when the source of the light was moving. But Einstein's theory set the stage for a number of new discoveries, and it linked the worlds of space and time forever. Special relativity explains that time moves slower at high speeds.

Possibly both. What was their importance? They were revolutionary. Why? Ah, there's the rub.As part of the centenary celebrations of Einstein's ""miraculous year"" when, as a 26-year-old patent office clerk he came up with his special theory of relativity (which is different from the general theory of relativity, which came 10 years later, and was even more revolutionary - let's just say it folded gravity into an already heady mix, and leave it there), a prize of £15,000 is being offered to anyone who can explain the theory in layman's terms. So let's have a go.First, it's not an entirely original concept: Galileo used a kind of relativity to explain why we're not all swept off the earth as it rotates. Imagine a moving ship, he said; within that ship, everything functions as though you're on dry land (or, if you're worried about wave motion, try a train). Einstein's observation was that the passage of time, which everyone had always simply assumed is constant and immutable, is not: it's the speed of light that is. ""Now Galileo would start to get unhappy there,"" says Sir Roger Penrose, author of The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, ""because you'd think if you're moving along almost with the speed of light, the light should seem to be going more slowly. Why does it seem to be going at the same speed, no matter how fast you move? It seems like a paradox at first.""The theory of relativity was revolutionary because it showed how the speed at which time happens is mutable; that space and time are not discrete entities: time and space and motion (ie, movement through space) collapse into a fourth dimension, in which all act on each other. It is impossible to say ""now"" without saying ""here"" and ""how fast"".Or, to put it another way, imagine you have a twin. You stay on earth, your twin goes into space on a fast rocket ship for 10 years; when they come back, they're a couple of years younger than you are. It even works with aeroplanes: circle the earth, flying low; when you return to your starting point, your watch will be slightly behind. ""If you were actually moving at the speed of light (which you couldn't do, but suppose you could),"" says Penrose, ""your watch would stop altogether."" It's a rather more expensive method of age-defiance than Crème de la Mer, but then again, it has the advantage of being a physical law of the universe.

Table of Contents Introduction to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Einstein’s theory of relativity is a groundbreaking concept that explains how gravity influences the movement of objects. It states that: “All observers, regardless of their own movement, must abide by the same physical laws and that the speed of light is always the same, regardless of the motion of its source.” This theory is considered to be one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century and has had a profound impact on our comprehension of the cosmos. At its foundation, the theory suggests that space and time are not absolute, but instead are relative to the motion of the observer. This implies that all observers in any given reference frame must adhere to the same physical laws, no matter their motion. This theory also introduced the idea of curved spacetime, which is the concept that space and time can be altered and curved by the presence of both matter and energy. The concept of relativity is divided into two distinct parts: the general theory of relativity, and the special theory of relativity. The general Einstein’s theory of relativity is concerned with investigating gravity and the way it influences the movement of matter in the cosmos. The special theory of relativity focuses on the velocity of light and how it is altered due to motion. The Principle of Relativity The Principle of relativity is a fundamental tenet of Einstein’s relativity. It states that: “The laws of physics are the same for all observers regardless of their motion.” Accordingly, the results of any experiment conducted in one frame of reference will be identical for all observers, regardless of their motion. This axiom is based on the notion that the speed of light is invariable for each observer, regardless of their motion in relation to the source. In other words, if two observers were to measure the speed of light from a distant star, they would both measure the same value, irrespective of their motion relative to the star. This is a significant notion in Einstein’s theory since it permits us to compare experiments done in distinct frames of reference and draw logical conclusions and inferences. More on Reference Frames and Relative Motion A reference frame serves a critical purpose in the realm of relativity. It is an observational standpoint in space that is not experiencing any motion (acceleration), from which a position can be determined across 3 dimensions (i.e. stationary or unchanging velocity). Not only that, a reference frame is able to ascertain measurements of the timing of events using a reference device that has consistent periodicity. An event is a moment which can be identified with respect to a reference frame, and it is known as a “point” in spacetime. Despite the fact that light requires time to reach the clock after an event has taken place, relativity theory states that the speed of light is constant in all reference frames, so that light pulses can be used to accurately measure distances and determine the time at which the event occurred. As an illustration, the detonation of a firecracker can be categorized as an “event”. We can completely identify an event by its four spacetime coordinates: the time of occurrence and its 3-dimensional spatial site make up a reference point. We may refer to this as reference frame (S). In Einstein’s theory of relativity, we often need to determine the coordinates of an event from different reference frames. The equations that link measurements taken in various frames are referred to as transformation equations. Standard Configuration To understand how spacetime coordinates are perceived by observers in different reference frames, it is beneficial to employ a simplified setting with frames in a standard configuration. This makes it possible to simplify the mathematics involved while still reaching the same conclusions. The figure shows two Galilean frames of reference (i.e. classical 3-space frames) in relative motion. The one labeled S is owned by the first observer O, while S′ belongs to the second observer O′. The x, y, and z axes of frame S are parallel to the appropriate primed axes of frame S’. Frame S’ moves in a single direction, namely the x-direction of frame S, with a steady velocity (v) as measured in frame S. The origins of frames S and S’ coincide when the time t = 0 in frame S and t’ = 0 in frame S’. In Einstein’s theory of relativity, there is no absolute reference frame, making the concept of ‘moving’ relative as everything could be moving with respect to some other frame. Consequently, two frames that move together at the same speed in the same direction are known as co-moving. In this context, S and S′ are not co-moving. Deficiency of Finding an Absolute Time Frame Galileo was the first to propose the idea of the principle of relativity, which claims that physical principles are the same in all inertial frames of reference, and this concept was embraced by Newtonian physics. During the late 19th century, the detection of electromagnetic waves prompted some physicists to propose that the universe was filled with a material they termed “aether”, which supposedly served as the medium transmitting these vibrations (similar to the way sound is passed through the air). This aether was assumed to be an absolute frame of reference for measuring velocities, and it was thought to be still and stationary relative to the Earth or any other fixed point of reference. It was thought that the aether was sufficiently flexible to carry electromagnetic waves, and could interact with matter, but would not obstruct any objects passing through it (the sole quality of the aether was that it permitted electromagnetic waves to travel). The findings of various experiments, such as the Michelson–Morley experiment in 1887 (which have since been confirmed with more precise and modern experiments), caused the theory of special relativity to be developed, since it indicated that the aether did not exist. Einstein then eliminated the concept of an aether and the absolute state of rest. According to relativity, any reference frame that is in constant motion will identify the same physical laws. Notably, the speed of light in a vacuum will always be measured as c, regardless of the speed of the system that is measuring it. If We Excluded Relativity’s Second Postulate Starting from the “Principle of Relativity”, without bringing in the second postulate, one can demonstrate that the space-time transformations between inertial frames are either Euclidean, Galilean, or Lorentzian. Furthermore, the Lorentzian case brings forth the conservation of relativistic intervals as well as a definite upper limit for speed (i.e. a certain limited speed). Observations seem to indicate that this speed is the speed of light in a vacuum. Exploring the Special Theory of Relativity In 1905, Albert Einstein published an article known as “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies” which unveiled his theory of special relativity. This followed after experiments such as the Michelson-Morley null result indicated that the luminiferous aether, a hypothesis of the time, was not present. (Source: ) This eventually led Einstein to develop special relativity to handle all movement, especially those at velocities near the speed of light (relativistic velocities). Currently, it is substantially accurate when gravitational and quantum effects are insignificant. Nonetheless, the Newtonian model is still applicable for everyday motions at low velocities compared to the speed of light. The special Einstein’s theory of relativity is based on the idea that the speed of light is always the same regardless of the motion of its source. One of the postulates states that: “The speed of light is the same for all observers regardless of their motion.” The theory explains how the laws of physics are affected by motion. This is stated clearly in its second postulate: “Time passes differently for two observers depending on their motion relative to one another.” For example, if two observers were moving at different speeds relative to one another, the observer who is moving faster would experience time as passing more slowly than the observer who is moving slower. The phenomenon is known as time dilation. The Special Theory of Relativity also explains the phenomenon of length contraction. This is the idea that the length of an object appears shorter to an observer who is moving relative to it. This is due to the fact that the speed of light is always the same regardless of the motion of its source. Numerous experiments have supported the varied implications of special relativity, such as the relativity of simultaneity, length contraction, time dilation, the relativistic velocity addition formula, the relativistic Doppler effect, relativistic mass, a universal speed limit, mass–energy equivalence, the speed of causality, and the Thomas precession. It has replaced the traditional idea of a universal time with one dependent on the reference frame and spatial location. Instead of a constant time interval between two occurrences, there is an invariant spacetime interval. In conjunction with other physical laws, the two postulates of special relativity predict the equivalence of mass and energy as expressed in the equation E = mc2, where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. This theory also clarifies the relationship between electricity and magnetism. This theory has been foundational for many of the most important scientific discoveries of the past century. Among these discoveries is the realization that time is not absolute, as previously thought, but instead is relative to the observer’s velocity. By which we were led to a better understanding of the structure of the universe, and has helped us better understand the behavior of particles at the subatomic level. Additionally, the special theory of relativity has helped to explain phenomena like gravitational waves, and the expansion of the universe. It has also been used to develop technologies such as GPS and particle accelerators. This theory continues to be an invaluable tool for scientists, and its discoveries have helped us to unlock the mysteries of the universe. Understanding the General Theory of Relativity The general theory of relativity, or the general theory of gravity, is a theory developed by Albert Einstein between 1907-1915. It explains the behavior of gravity and how it affects the motion of objects in the universe. This theory states that: “matter and energy can distort space and time, and this distortion affects the motion of objects.” The general Einstein’s theory of relativity is based on the idea of curved spacetime. This is the idea that space and time can be bent by the presence of matter and energy. Which means that the path of an object in space can be curved by the presence of other objects with mass. The general theory of relativity also introduced the concept of black holes, which are regions of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them. Analyzing the Equation of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Einstein’s theory of relativity is expressed in a mathematical equation known as Einstein’s Field Equation. This equation relates the curvature of spacetime to the energy and momentum of matter and energy. It states that: “The curvature of spacetime is directly proportional to the energy and momentum of matter and energy.” (Source: ) The equation is written as follows: Where Rμν: the Ricci curvature tensor, gμν: the metric tensor, R: the Ricci scalar, G: the gravitational constant, c: the speed of light, and Tμν: the stress-energy tensor. The equation was derived by Einstein in 1915 and is considered to be one of the most important equations in physics. It is used to explain the behavior of gravity and is the basis for general Einstein’s theory of relativity. Exploring the Concept of Time Dilation The concept of time dilation is a key part of the special theory of relativity. It states that: ”The passage of time can vary depending on the motion of the observer.” This means that if two observers are moving relative to one another, the observer who is moving faster will experience time as passing more slowly than the observer who is moving slower. This phenomenon can be demonstrated using the famous “Twin Paradox”. In this thought experiment, two twins are separated and one of them travels at a speed close to the speed of light for a significant amount of time. When the twin returns, it is found that the twin who stayed still has aged more than the one who traveled. This is because the twin who traveled experienced time as passing more slowly due to his motion relative to the one who stayed still. Time dilation has been confirmed in experiments and is an important part of the special theory of relativity. Examining the Impact of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Einstein’s theory of relativity has had a remarkable influence on our comprehension of the cosmos. It has completely reshaped our perspectives on space and time and has had a noteworthy consequence on various disciplines such as astrophysics, cosmology, and quantum mechanics. For example, the general theory of relativity explains the behavior of gravity, which has allowed us to better understand the structure of the universe. It has also been used to explain the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, which is the bending of light due to the presence of matter and energy. The special theory of relativity has also been used to explain the phenomenon of time dilation and has had a major impact on our understanding of the nature of time. It has also been used to explain the behavior of matter and energy at the quantum level, which has led to the development of quantum mechanics. Exploring the Applications of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Einstein’s theory of relativity has many practical applications. For example, it is used to explain the behavior of GPS systems, which rely on the accurate measurement of time in order to calculate the user’s position. GPS systems use the effects of time dilation to correct for the effects of the user’s motion relative to the satellite. The theory is also used in the study of black holes. Black holes are regions of space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape from them. This phenomenon is explained by the general theory"

0,wondriumdaily,General Relativity explained like you've never seen before,https://www.wondriumdaily.com/how-einstein-solved-the-general-theory-of-relativity/,"Theory PubliclyIn 1914, Einstein had already spent three years searching for the correct field equations that would complete his theory of gravity, geometry, and acceleration, known as general relativity. This theory explains how the force of gravity and acceleration are the same.He was getting closer to reaching a solution; however, the current version of his field equations had problems: They were still noncovariant.But despite this, Einstein gradually became more—instead of less—confident in the validity of his incorrect result.This is a transcript from the video series What Einstein Got Wrong. A full decade had passed since he first published his special theory of relativity. It was around this time that Einstein began to present publicly the incorrect version of his theory. In a week-long series of lectures in June of 1915, Einstein presented the incorrect version of his theory to a group of physicists and mathematicians at a university in Germany, going into considerable detail.Using Einstein’s incorrect version of the theory, David Hilbert began to work toward producing a correct and complete form of general relativity. (Image: Von Unbekannt – Possibly Reid, Constance (1970) Hilbert, Berlin, Heidelberg/Public domain)Among those in attendance were David Hilbert—one of the world’s most brilliant mathematicians and perhaps, one of the greatest and most influential mathematicians of all time. Hilbert immediately took a great interest in Einstein’s new theory.In hindsight, we can see that Einstein already had all of the most important physical pieces of his theory correctly in place—elements like the equivalence principle, among others. But Einstein’s math was inconsistent and at times incorrect.Hilbert seems to have recognized this, and he began to work toward producing a correct and complete form of general relativity, perhaps before Einstein would be able to do so. With Einstein and Hilbert both working toward this same goal, the remaining months of 1915 became a race to see who would be the first to complete the greatest and most celebrated theory in the history of physics.Learn more about Starting Fresh on the Theory of RelativityBut before Einstein would be able to make further progress toward this goal, he would first have to recognize the fumbles and missteps he had already made. This happened gradually, and by October he had finally realized how serious the problems were with the current version of this theory.Einstein abandoned it completely. In its place, he returned to his earlier work, focusing on the results that he had produced years earlier while pursuing the more mathematical version of his strategy.After spending weeks studying his old notes carefully, Einstein began to notice some of the mistakes he had made at the time. (Image: Ernestoectorado/Public domain)After spending weeks looking over the notebooks that he had produced in those earlier years, Einstein began to recognize some of the conceptual mistakes he had made at the time.Looking at it with fresh eyes, Einstein gradually became convinced that using this approach, it was possible to construct an entirely covariant form of the field equations—exactly the thing his theory was missing.Furthermore, he could see both how those equations would incorporate the equivalence principle and how they would match the predictions of Newtonian gravity for things like planetary orbits. There was still an excruciating math problem ahead of him, but for the first time, Einstein saw the way forward to the final version of his theory.Learn more about The Race to Find a SolutionOver the entire month of November 1915, Einstein worked feverishly toward the goal of producing the final, correct, and completely covariant form of his field equations. By the middle of the month, he had gotten close but was not yet to the final answer.However, he saw how it would be possible to correctly predict the details of Mercury’s orbit—something he had failed to do before. Einstein also recognized by this time that his former prediction for the deflection of light had been incorrect.He now knew it was a lucky break that the eclipse of 1914, which would have allowed him to publicly test his theory, had never been measured.During this time, however, Einstein was extremely anxious that Hilbert was going to beat him to the final answer. After spending an entire decade on this problem, the thought of Hilbert getting the credit must have been consuming for Einstein.But in mid-November, Einstein received a copy of Hilbert’s paper, presenting his version of the field equations.In many ways, Hilbert’s results were similar to Einstein’s work. He had made many of the same realizations Einstein had recently made.Learn more about But neither Hilbert nor Einstein had the correct version of the equations that they were both looking for, at least not yet.Einstein’s Final EquationsFinally, on November 25, 1915, Einstein presented the equations that are today found in every textbook on relativity. By only the thinnest of margins, Einstein had beaten Hilbert to the correct answer.This final version of the gravitation field equations is entirely covariant and completely mathematically self-consistent. They predict the orbit of Mercury and the deflection of light correctly.They suffer from no physical or mathematical problems, and they describe how our universe truly is and how it truly behaves.Einstein’s Field EquationEinstein’s final equations are also mathematically elegant. Despite being unusually hard to put to use in practice, they are quite simple from a conceptual point of view.These equations relate a set of mathematical quantities known as tensors. Some of these tensors describe the geometry of space, while another describes how matter and other forms of energy are distributed throughout space.Technically speaking, Einstein’s field equations are a set of 10 different equations. Each of these equations is related and interconnected to the others, and to find a useful solution, generally, all 10 of these equations have to be solved at the same time.These equations are particularly difficult to solve because they are what mathematicians call non-linear. This means that when one input is changed, it invariably ends up changing several other things at the same time.Einstein himself had to use various simplifying approximations to make the initial predictions of his theory. These days, relativists often use supercomputers to find approximate—but potentially very accurate—solutions to these equations.Learn more about In 1915, Einstein completed and published his general theory of relativity. This theory is widely considered Einstein’s greatest contribution to science, if not perhaps the greatest scientific accomplishment of the twentieth century, of all time.Overturning Conventional Views on GravityBefore Einstein, physicists thought of gravity simply as a force that attracts massive objects toward one another. In a sense, this is correct.Gravity pulls us downward and toward the Earth, and it keeps the Earth in its orbit by pulling it toward the Sun. But this view of gravity—the Newtonian view—fails to recognize the greater significance of the phenomena called gravity.What Einstein had discovered is that gravity is not merely a force but is instead the very manifestation of the shape or geometry of space and time.The presence of mass changes the geometry of the surrounding space & tie by curving or warping it.(Image: Lucas Vieira Barbosa authored the original OGV. Selected frames (10 percent of the original) extracted and re-timed by Stigmatella aurantiaca/Public domain)According to Einstein, the presence of mass and other energy changes the geometry of the surrounding space and time, curving or warping it. This curving or warping causes objects to move through space differently than they would have otherwise.When an object moves through space far from any massive bodies, without being pulled or pushed by any forces, it simply moves forward in a straight line. According to Einstein, when the Earth moves in its orbit around the Sun, it too is moving in a straight line.The presence of the Sun has reshaped the geometry of the Solar System, bending space and transforming the Earth’s trajectory. Gravity isn’t a force at all, according to Einstein, but geometry, which is a consequence of mass and energy.By explaining gravity in terms of geometry, Einstein overturned hundreds of years of established physics. Furthermore, his theory is not only profoundly creative and mathematically elegant, but it is also right. The predictions of this theory agree extremely well with many observations that have been made.Learn more about How Einstein’s Theory Holds Up TodayTo date, no experiment or other test has been found to conflict with the predictions of general relativity. Maybe one day there will be some circumstances under which Einstein’s theory"

0,researchgate,General Relativity explained like you've never seen before,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360928344_Brief_Introduction_to_the_Theory_of_Relativity,"theory of relativity contains Einstein’s two inter-related theories: i)Special Relativity, and ii)General Relativity. SPECIAL RELATIVITY Newton’s classical mechanics and Maxwell’s electromagnetism theory are in compatible but with change in coordinates ,their law transform differently. Einstein found a uniﬁcation of mechanics and electromagnetism, now known under the term “special relativity theory”. CLASICAL KINEMATICS Absolute Space In Sir Isaac Newton’s world space exists independently of all the objects contained in it. In his own words: “Absolute space, in its own nature, without regard to anything external, remains always similar and immovable”. The geometry of space is assumed to be Euclidean . Absolute Time Newton’s ideas about time are similar to those about space: “Absolute, true and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature ﬂows equably without regard to anything external”. ELECTRODYNAMICS In ancient physics, aether is a theoretical medium which is considered to be a medium in which light and electromagnetic waves travels. According to Maxwell, Maxwell's equations only hold in the frame in which the aether is at rest which means light should be constant while light should travel at speed c relative to the aether. RELATIVISTIC KINEMATICS Special relativity explains the relationship between space and time depending upon two postulates:A)The laws of physics are invariant in all non-accelerating frames of reference. B)The speed light in vacuum is constant and same for all observers. It will not change with respect to motion of source or observer. Aether theory abolishes. Space-TimeEinstein merges space and time to the 4- dimensional spacetime. The elements of spacetime are called events. spacetime is any mathematical model which fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional manifold. Spacetime diagrams can be used to visualise relativistic effects, such as why different observers perceive where and when events occur differently. LIMITATION OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY Special relativity only applies to inertial reference frames when motion is in a straight line at constant speed. Therefore it could not be applied to situations involving forces such as electromagnetic forces involving charges and currents or the force of Gravity. GENERAL RELATIVITY Einstein introduced gravity into theory of relativity which is now known as General Relativity. It generalises Special Relativity and reﬁnes Newton’s Universal law of Gravitation. CLASSICAL THEORY OF GRAVITATION Newton states that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centres. F=Gm1m2/r2 Here G = 6. 673 ╳ 10⌃−11 m⌃3 kg⌃−1 s⌃−2 is the gravitational constant. m1 and m2 are masses of two objects separated by distance r. MODERN THEORY OF GRAVITATION General Relativity provides a uniﬁed description of gravity as a property of Space-Time. General Relativity is structured with the help of differential geometry especially Riemannian Geometry . Einstein’s Field Equation In the general relativity the Einstein ﬁeld equations relate the geometry of spacetime to the distribution of matter within it. The Einstein ﬁeld equations (EFE) may be written in the form:where, Gµν is the Einstein Tensor, gµν is the metric tensor, Tµν is the stress energy tensor, Λ is the cosmological constant, and κ is the Einstein gravitational constant.The Einstein Tensor is deﬁned as,where, Rµν is the Ricci curvature tensor, and R is the scalar curvature. NOTE: Scalar Curvature is a symmetric second-degree tensor that depends on only the metric tensor and its ﬁrst and second derivatives.The Einstein gravitational constant is deﬁned as,where G is the Newtonian constant of gravitation, and c is the speed of light in vacuum.The EFE can thus also be written as, LIMITATIONS OF GENERAL RELATIVITY A)General Relativity Does Not Respect Local Energy-Momentum. B)General Relativity Predicts Space-Time Singularities. C)General Relativity Failed to Be Quantised. PHENOMENONS SUPPORTING THEORY OF RELATIVITY TIME DILATION Time dilation is a phenomenon described by the theory of relativity which causes observers moving with different velocities to experience different time. Imagine a man in a train, which is travelling at the speed of light. When he turn around and look towards the back of the train. Unfortunately, he can’t see it. One can only see an object when light reﬂected from the object enters one’s eyes but the man is travelling at the speed of light. Therefore, the light rays from the back of the train can never reach him.This appears to be a foolproof test which contradicts the Principle of Relativity, which is a very basic law. If principle is right then the carriage’s back must look normal to the man.This further implies that the light from the back of the carriage still reaches man’s eyes as it normally would. This can only happen if light ignores the motion of the train entirely and travels at an apparent absolute speed. i.e. The speed of light is same for everyone, if they are not accelerating. Light Clock Experiment Imagine two horizontal mirrors facing each other such that one mirror is spaced above the other by the distance d. Also imagine that there is a pulse of light that bounces vertically between the two mirrors as shown in the left part of the drawing below. Suppose our ""light clock"" was traveling sideways at a very high (constant)speed. Now the pulse would follow the path shown on the right side of the drawing. The light must travel a greater distance now to make a round trip . Since its speed is the same as before, it will take longer to make a round trip. So our ""light clock"" takes longer to count out its intervals. Another way of saying this is that the clock ""ticks"" more slowly. In other words, time itself slows down in a moving object. But time will appear to be normal to a person who’s travelling with the light clock. Albert Einstein derived an equation for the result, which is t = amount of time that passes for you, according to a clock you carryT= amount of time that passes on the moving objectv = velocity of moving objectc = speed of light LENGTH CONTRACTION Length contraction is the physical phenomenon of a decrease in length detected by an observer in objects that travel at any non-zero velocity relative to that observer. Let’s say that four friends A, B, C and D decide to measure the length of a train. We’ll assume that they’re armed with little ray-guns which emit beams of light. A)When train is at rest,A ﬁres the gun which hits B after 40 nanoseconds. So according to them, the length of the train isl = (3*108) * (4*10-8) = 12m.B)When train is moving, Suppose the readings are taken by C and D who are standing outside the train. C notes the time at which A ﬁres the gun while D notes the time when B gets hit. According to D, by the time the ray hits B, the train has moved forward and therefore he notes the time to be lesser than 40 nanoseconds. Let’s say 30 nanoseconds. So, l = (3*108) * (3*10-8) = 9mThis implies that moving objects shrink relative to the reference frame. Hendrik Lorentz derived an equation for calculating length contraction, which is L’ = proper length L = length observed by an observer in relative motion with respect to the object v = velocity of moving object c = speed of light MASS-ENERGY EQUIVALENCE Relativity explains that the energy provided to the body increases its momentum but not its velocity, i.e. the mass of the body appears to increase and is known as relativistic mass. Albert Einstein derived an equation for calculating relativistic mass, which is m’ = relativistic mass m = mass when object is at rest with respect to the observer v = velocity of moving object c = speed of light The relativistic mass arrises in the mass of the body is due to the energy supplied to that body which is given by a world famous equation, This implies that even miniature objects actually have a lot of locked-up energy. CONCLUSION Albert Einstein’s Theory of relativity has wide varying applications. It helps to accurately determine the position of moving aircrafts which is vital to the safety associated with air travel. E=mc2 also helps to determine the amount of energy stored in a substance which pave way to invention of new source of electricity known as “nuclear energy”. It gives insight into some marvellous phenomenons which are unknown to the world such as mercury’s movement around sun and blackholes. It also introduces new concepts like time travelling which will empowers modern era of speed. More certainly, it abolishes the classical physics which depends on euclidian world and opens door to modern physics. Relativity has changed our life; and the way we look at things; and has shown that sometimes common sense just doesn’t work.

The special theory of relativity was quickly accepted by the general scientific community, and its implications for general philosophical thought were profound.Despite this general acceptance, it is important to note that Einstein did not receive the for relativity. Ironically, Einstein's 1921 for Physics was awarded for his important contributions to (a theory ultimately irreconcilable with relativity theory) via his explanation of the .The special theory of relativity challenged and eventually overturned classical concepts such as French chemist 's (1743-1794) conservation of mass and Prussian physicist Hermann von Helmholtz's (1821-1894) conservation of energy. According to special relativity theory, mass itself was not conserved except as part of a fusion of mass and energy. Mass was nothing more than a manifestation of energy.Although Einstein's special theory was limited to special cases dealing with systems in uniform non-accelerated motion, it reverberated with philosophical consequence because it dispensed with absolutes (i.e., ""absolute"" rest or motion). Special relativity gave rise to a plethora of paradoxes dealing with the passage of time (e.g., the twin paradox) and with problems dependent upon assumptions of simultaneity. For example, under certain conditions, it was impossible to determine when one event happened in relation to another event. Classically separate concepts of three dimensions of geometrical space and a fourth dimension of time were fused into space-time.As a result, those unfamiliar with the mathematical underpinnings of relativity theory often classified it as bizarre and in opposition to common sense. Einstein patiently pointed out that our perceptions of ""common sense"" were derived only from experiences with objects of an intermediate size, between the atomic and cosmic scale, that moved at velocities far below the speed of light.It is not possible to understate the impact of Einstein's general theory upon the scientific community. Newtonian formulations of gravity were, prior to the publication of general relativity theory, considered proven. Only the mechanism, not the effects of gravity, were still a subject of inquiry (e.g., Poincaré's gravity waves). Although a quantum theory"

This theory was originally developed by Einstein, with help from David Hilbert in its final mathematical formulation, as a generalization of the postulates of Special Relativity to account for non-inertial, accelerating observers, particularly those in a gravitational field. A dramatic but later discredited claim by Sir Arthur Eddington of experimental proof of General Relativity in 1919 popularized the theory. These theories have augmented earlier approaches, such as . The theory of relativity is defended with religious-like zeal, such that no college faculty tenure, Ph.D degree, or is ever awarded to anyone who dares criticize the theory, as the example of denying a Nobel Prize to the most accomplished physicist of the 20th century, , illustrates. Other critics of the theory are , who called it a ""...magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates, dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors. The theory is like a beggar clothed in purple whom ignorant people take for a king ... its exponents are brilliant men but they are metaphysicists, not scientists..."" and Louis Essen [1908-1997], the man credited with determining the speed of light. He wrote fiery papers and many feature articles of the subject in science journals with popular audiences against it such as ""Relativity and Time Signals"" and ""Relativity - Joke or Swindle?"". Perhaps the most famous website opposing relativity is this one, with its page. The cornerstone item in that page involves the experimental measurements of the advance of the perihelion of Mercury that show a shift greater than predicted by Relativity, well beyond the margin of error. There are some issues of continuity and limits arising in the mathematical analysis of the theory of relativity. See for discussion of this point. The theory of relativity consist of complex mathematical equations relying on several hypotheses. For example, at Hofstra University general relativity is taught as part of an upperclass math course on differential geometry, based on three stated assumptions. Special relativity assumes that all observers in inertial frames of reference will measure the same value for the speed of light, c and that all inertial frames of reference are equivalent. These hypotheses that can never be fully tested. Relativity rejects Newton's action at a distance, which is basic to Newtonian gravity and also found to be a consequence of quantum mechanics. The mathematics of relativity assume no exceptions, yet in the time period immediately following the origin of the universe the relativity equations could not possibly have been valid, since quantum effects would not be negligible (in the same way non-relativistic quantum mechanics is not valid when dealing with particles traveling near the speed of light). The ""continuous"" nature of space and time postulated by relativity is in conflict with the ""discrete"" nature in , and although theories like and have attempted to unify relativity and quantum mechanics, neither has been entirely successful or proven. Unlike , in which space and time intervals are each invariant as seen by all observers, in SR the only invariant quantity is a quadratic combination of space and time intervals (x2 - c2 t2). The instantaneous transmission of Newtonian gravitational effects also contradicts relativity. In quantum mechanics, the suggests that virtual particles can sometimes travel faster than the speed of light which would violate causality, but ""[t]he only known way to resolve this tension involves introducing the idea of antiparticles."" Consequently, in 1928 derived the Dirac equation, one of the first quantum mechanical equations compatible with special relativity, by which Dirac predicted the existence of antimatter. Four years later, antimatter (the positron) was discovered by Carl Anderson, as successfully predicted by relativistic quantum mechanics. , a generalization of quantum mechanics, is fully compatible with special relativity but not with general relativity, and still lacks a vital piece: evidence of the . Special Relativity Lorentz and Poincaré developed Special Relativity as way of understanding how Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism could be valid in different frames of reference. Einstein famously published an explanation of Poincaré's theory in terms of two assumptions (postulates): The laws of physics are identical in all inertial reference frames. The is the same for all (inertial) observers, regardless of their velocities relative to each other. As an example of the first of these, if one performs an experiment—say, with a pendulum or some similar apparatus—in a railroad car traveling uniformly at 50 miles per hour, one would find the results of the experiment (positions, speeds, etc.) to be consistent with the laws of physics in the railroad car. An outside stationary observer, looking through the window, would also find the results consistent with the laws of physics in his stationary reference frame. He would simply have to subtract 50 miles per hour from the velocities of the objects in order to get values that agree with the values obtained by the observer on the train. But the two observations would each be consistent with the laws of physics. This is all straightforward and obvious to modern people, and has been since the time of Galileo. This principle is now called ""Galilean relativity"". Another way of stating this is: There is no ""preferred"" frame of reference. Neither observer can claim that his frame of reference is ""right"". Of course, the observer on the train would think that the Earth is moving at 50 miles per hour under the wheels. The second postulate is what makes relativity what it is. Using the above principle, if someone in the railroad car shines a beam of light forward, he would observe it moving at a speed of 670,000,000 miles per hour. One would expect, according to the first postulate, that an observer standing on the ground would measure its speed as 670,000,050 miles per hour. But the second postulate says that the stationary observer measures the same speed, 670,000,000 miles per hour. While this seems paradoxical, many experiments, such as the show that it is nevertheless true. Special Relativity explains the apparent inconsistency between these postulates. Why was this not observed until around 1900? Because the speed of light is so great that the discrepancy is very hard to measure. For example, in the railroad experiment described above, the discrepancy between the two speeds is 7.5 parts per million. There are many far-reaching consequences of this, and many experimental verifications, some of which are listed below. Two of the more interesting consequences are that: No material object of nonzero mass can travel at or greater than the speed of light. (Objects of zero mass, such as photons, travel at exactly the speed of light.) Information can not travel faster than the speed of light. This is sometimes stated as: There is no ""action at a distance,"" because that would make observations dependent on the frame of reference. See for a discussion of this point. When the assumptions are stated clearly as above, the weaknesses in the theory are more apparent. There “is” action at a distance in and apparently also in gravity, as no gravitons can be found. However, no information has yet been transmitted via quantum entanglement, so while non-locality violates the spirit of relativity it is consistent with it if relativity is limited to the transmission of information. , an attempt to partially reconcile with relativity, is incomplete at best. As to the second assumption, it is contrary to the , which illustrates the lack of symmetry in time. Logical defects include the incoherence of relativistic mass (see discussion below) and the lack of relativistic constraints near the beginning the universe (see above). Special Relativity (SR) was initially developed by and , working on problems in electrodynamics and the , which had not found any sign of Earth's orbital motion through the , which was believed to be the substance which carried electromagnetic waves. Special relativity alters 's laws of motion by assuming that the speed of light will be the same for all observers, despite their relative velocities and the source of the light. (Therefore, if A sends a beam of light to B, and both measure the speed, it will be the same for both, no matter what the relative velocity of A and B. In Newtonian/Galilean mechanics, If A sends a physical object at a particular velocity towards B, and nothing slows it, the velocity of the object relative to B depends on the velocities of the object and of B relative to A.) At low speeds (relative to light-speed), the Lorentz-Poincaré relativity equations are equivalent to Newton's equations. The media-promoted equation , implausibly suggests a relationship between typically unrelated concepts of energy, the rest mass of a body and the speed of light. Under relativity, particles at low mass and low speed can be accurately approximated by (such as 's laws of motion). At the two extremes, modeling the behavior of electrons requires that relativistic effects be taken into account (the chemically significant phenomenon of electron spin arises from relativity), and the course of light passing through a region containing many massive bodies such as galaxies will be distorted (, in which light travels in straight lines, does not predict this). These are both experimentally confirmed (electron spin was known before relativity arose, and telescopic observations confirm that galactic clusters distort the paths of the light passing through them). Many scientists have indicated problems with the postulates of special relativity. Paul Davies, formerly of Macquarie University and now at the University of Arizona believes that the speed of light has changed over time. Since the speed of light is a constant speed 'c' this indicates problems with the theory . Other engineers and scientists have written about problems in the basic set of special relativity equations. Based on the ideas of not Einstein but of the scientist Fitzgerald as well as others, a length contraction effect was predicted as an explanation of the failure of the Michelson-Morley experiment to detect Earth's orbital motion. This idea was taken up by Hendrik Lorentz and shown by others to be a useful mechanism by which theory could be derived from experimental results. In fact, the Michelson-Morley experiment is often cited in textbooks as the derivation of relativity, though there are many other experiments that do this; see below. In 2005, Michael Strauss, a computer engineer, claimed to have shown clear contradictions in Special Relativity, invalidating much of it. In 2004 he wrote the book Requiem for Relativity (The Collapse of Special Relativity), ASIN 0976312506. An archived ad for the book may be found at . The original web site for it is no longer active. General Relativity See the page for more in-depth coverage of this topic. General Relativity is a theory of gravity that is compatible with Special Relativity. Einstein explains a thought experiment involving two elevators. The first elevator is stationary on the Earth, while the other is being pulled through space at a constant acceleration of g. Einstein realized that any physical experiment carried out in the elevators would give the same result. This realization is known as the equivalence principle and it states that accelerating frames of reference and gravitational fields are indistinguishable. General Relativity is the theory of gravity that incorporates Special Relativity and the equivalence principle. General Relativity is a mathematical extension of Special Relativity. GR views space-time as a 4-dimensional , which looks locally like , and which acquires due to the presence of massive bodies. Thus, near massive bodies, the geometry of space-time differs to a large degree from that of other parts of the universe. Just as in classical physics, objects travel along in the absence of external forces. Importantly though, near a massive body, geodesics are no longer straight lines. It is this phenomenon of objects traveling along geodesics in a curved spacetime that accounts for gravity. The ""anomalous precession"" of Mercury's (slow shift of the orbit's major axis) is explained by the Theory of General Relativity, but not by Newtonian mechanics. Some precession (5600 arcseconds per century) is caused by purely classical phenomena, mostly the gravitational attraction of other planets. But a small amount (43 arcseconds per century) of the observed precession, goes beyond that which classical Newtonian mechanics can explain. General relativity explains it accurately. There was another explanation based on Newtonian gravity, involving a slight alteration to the precise inverse-square relation of Newtonian gravity to distance, but it was quickly discarded when it gave very bad results for the Moon's orbit. The relativistic explanation of the anomalous precession is disputed on the page of Conservapedia. British Historian Paul Johnson declared the turning point in 20th century to have been when fellow Briton Sir , an esteemed English astronomer, ventured out on a boat off Africa in 1919 with a local Army unit to observe the bending of starlight around the sun during a total eclipse. Upon his return to England declared that his observations proven the theory of relativity. In fact recent analysis of Eddington's work revealed that he was biased in selecting his data, and that overall his data were inconclusive about the theory of relativity. The prediction was later confirmed by more rigorous experiments, such as those performed by the . had this to say on the discrepancies between the empirical eclipse data and Einstein's predictions. It indeed seems that the discrepancies may be ascribed to faults in observations, which supposition is supported by the fact that the observations at Prince's Island, which, it is true, did not turn out quite as well as those mentioned above, gave the result, of 1.64, somewhat lower than Einstein's figure. The bending of light by gravity is predicted both by Newtonian physics and relativity. Experimental observation agrees with the latter amount (1.75 arcseconds for the Sun), rather approximately for Eddington's measurements, and very accurately for more modern measurements. Special relativity is the limiting case of general relativity where all gravitational fields are weak. Alternatively, special relativity is the limiting case of general relativity when all reference frames are inertial (non-accelerating and without gravity). Lack of evidence for Relativity The Theory of relativity assumes that time is symmetric just as space is, but the biggest early promoter of relativity, Arthur Eddington, coined the term """" admitting how time is not symmetric but is directional. The passage of time is tied to an increase in disorder, or . The Theory of relativity cannot explain this, and implicitly denies it, specifically allowing for theoretical time travel (e.g., ) and different rates of passage of time based on velocity and acceleration. The () requires exquisitely accurate timekeeping in the satellite clocks—down to the nanosecond. This precision is so great that the effects of both special relativity and general relativity play an important role. Without making corrections to the timing signals from the satellite clocks, the results of GPS measurements would be so far off that the system would be useless. The required amount of correction is well known, and the system makes those corrections. Those corrections are consistent with special relativity and general relativity, and it is generally accepted that this is no coincidence—relativistic effects are the reason why the corrections are necessary. But one doesn't need to believe that relativity is the reason the corrections are needed; one only needs to make the corrections in order to get the system to work. Tom Van Flandern, an astronomer hired to work on GPS in the late 1990s, concluded that ""[t]he GPS programmers don't need relativity."" He was quoted as saying that the GPS programmers ""have basically blown off Einstein."" Asynchronization can be easily addressed through communications between the satellites and ground stations, so it is unclear why any theory would be needed for GPS. While Van Flandern believed that relativity is unnecessary for GPS, he also asserted that observations of GPS satellites supported both general and special relativity, writing that ""we can assert with confidence that the predictions of relativity are confirmed to high accuracy over time periods of many days,"" with unrelated factors interfering with longer-term observations. Some internet articles claim that GPS timing differences confirm the Theory of Relativity or its Lorentzian counterpart (which uses a preferred frame of reference). GPS clocks run slower in the weaker gravitation field of the satellites than on ground stations on Earth, with the effects predicted by general relativity far outweighing the effects predicted by special relativity. However, the articles claiming that the slower GPS satellite clocks confirm relativity do not address the effect, if any, of the weaker gravitational force under Newton's theory on the GPS satellite clocks, likely because in Newtonian Mechanics every clock in the universe keeps time at the same rate regardless of velocity, acceleration, or the presence or absence of force. Currently, GPS satellites are synchronized to Coordinated Universal Time by radio signals from the ground; therefore, they cannot currently be used to test general relativity. The effects of relativity have been observed with the frequency shift of the signal being sent back to several times as various spacecraft have dipped into the gravity wells around massive objects such as the (see image at right) or Saturn. The Gravity Probe B satellite was put in orbit about the Earth to examine the effects of frame dragging and geodetic warping of space. One report was that it showed ""unprecedented precision"", and one showed a 95% confidence that the measured effect was consistent with General Relativity. Note, however, that one interpretation of Newtonian mechanics also predicts deflection of light by gravity. This is the ""light is particles"" interpretation, and gives a deflection of 0.875 arcseconds, whereas the ""light is waves"" interpretation predicts a deflection of zero. The experimentally measured deflection is 1.75 arcseconds, and is the value given by General Relativity (though Einstein's initial calculation was 0.875.). None of the NASA spacecraft incorporates predictions of relativity into their own timing mechanisms, as Newtonian mechanics is adequate even for probes sent deep into space so long as they do not undergo accelerations near the speed of light or enter any massive gravity wells. A decade of observation of the pair detected a decline in its orbital period, which was attributed to a loss in energy by the system. It is impossible to measure the masses of the pulsars, their accelerations relative to the observers, or other fundamental parameters. Professors Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse, who discovered the binary pulsar, found that physical values could be assigned to the pulsars to make the observed decline in orbital period consistent with the Theory of General Relativity, and for this they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physics, which is the only award ever given by the Nobel committee for the Theory of Relativity. In 2004, Professor Taylor utilized a correction to the derivative of the orbital period to fit subsequent data better to the theory. At most, assumptions can be made and altered to fit the data to the theory, rather than the data confirming the theory. The of Mercury's precesses at a measurable rate, but even after accounting for gravitational perturbations caused all other planets in the , Newton's theory (assuming a precise inverse-square relationship for distance) predicts a rate of precession that differs from the measured rate by approximately 43 per century. While general relativity was developed on purely theoretical grounds, it was soon discovered that it explained these precession observations. Newton's theory can also explain the Mercury precession by making tiny adjustments to parameters in the gravitational equation, but doing so would give the same precession for all orbiting bodies everywhere, a phenomenon which is not observed. General relativity predicts twice as much bending in light as it passes near massive objects than Newton's theory might predict. This phenomenon is known as . A large number of instances of gravitational lensing have been observed, and it is now a standard astronomical tool. Note, however, that the extent of bending of light predicted by Newton's theory is open to debate, and depends on assumptions about the nature of light for gravitational purposes. In 1972, scientists flew extremely accurate clocks (""atomic clocks"") around the world in both directions on commercial airlines, and claimed to observe relativistic time dilation; the eastbound clock gained 273 ns and the westbound clock lost 59 ns, matching the predictions of general relativity to within experimental accuracy. However, the inventor of the atomic clock, Louis Essen, declared that the experiment was inaccurate. Dr A. G. Kelly examined the raw data from the experiment and declared it inconclusive. The Nobel Committee chose not to honor this experiment for the significance that was claimed. Experimental and Observational Evidence Confirming Relativity The different effects predicted by special relativity, compared to classical formulations, are extremely tiny. Most relativistic effects are negligible at the speeds of ordinary phenomena observed by humans. The effects only become significant when the speeds involved are a significant fraction of the speed of light, which is meters per second—such speeds are called relativistic. (However, it's worth noting that ordinary magnetism can be considered an effect of relativity, dictated by the need for electrostatic theory to be correct under relativity. The speed of light in fact appears in the formulas () governing electricity and magnetism, though these equations were developed long before relativity was proposed.) Because the effects of relativity are so tiny, scientists have been devising sophisticated and sensitive tests ever since the theory was formulated in 1905. It is important to be aware that it is fairly rare for an experiment to prove a theory. In general, experiments can only refute a theory. They can also be consistent with a theory. When enough experiments, especially experiments that investigate a wide variety of phenomena, are shown to be consistent with a theory, it lends credence to that theory. When no other plausible theory can explain those observations, we can say that they validate the theory. The Mercury observations are just one phenomenon. By themselves they couldn't validate or prove GR. And there was at one time another competing theory—the Newcomb-Hall exponent-fudging theory. That one didn't hold up for things other than Mercury. No other theory"

0,vis.sciencemag,General Relativity explained like you've never seen before,https://vis.sciencemag.org/generalrelativity/,"General Relativity explained like you've never seen before A super-quick, super-painless guide to the theory that conquered the universe. scroll downto begin For 100 years, the general theory of relativity has been a pillar of modern physics. The basic idea is so elegant that you don’t need superpowers to understand it. Begin with Isaac Newton’s first law of motion: An object remains in uniform motion unless acted on by a force. That means if you feel no force you’ll either sit still or glide forever in a straight line at a constant speed. But Albert Einstein asked himself ... What happens if I step off a roof? While I’m freefalling I feel weightless. I don’t feel any force, even as I accelerate toward the ground! Einstein had landed inside a paradox. An object that feels no force should travel at a constant speed. But something accelerating because of gravity feels no force. Einstein realized that if he resolved the paradox, he might explain the origins of gravity. This is the happiest thought in my life! The solution: gravity is space & time! Einstein realized that Massive things like Earth warp spacetime. A freefalling object then follows the straightest possible path in spacetime. So—even though that path doesn’t look straight to us—the object experiences no force. “It works roughly like this. Follow me back to the roof. If we turn off gravity, I just float—tracing a straight line in this diagram.” “Now turn gravity back on. Earth’s mass warps spacetime so that time on the ground ticks slower than time on the roof.” We have to stretch out the time axis nearer to the ground, so the diagram curves. Now a straight line takes me from the roof to the ground! Of course, saying that gravity is the warping of spacetime is a whole lot easier than turning that insight into a quantitative theory. Einstein labored for years to explain mathematically exactly how the distribution of mass and energy warps spacetime. Today, Einstein’s general relativity remains scientists’ best understanding of gravity and a key to our understanding of the cosmos on the grandest scale. Learn more at"

The majority of these mutations will have no effect; but one might change the of one of the butterfly's offspring, making it harder (or easier) for predators to see. If this color change is advantageous, the chances of this butterfly's surviving and producing its own offspring are a little better, and over time the number of butterflies with this mutation may form a larger percentage of the population. are defined as mutations whose effects do not influence the of an individual. These can increase in frequency over time due to . It is believed that the overwhelming majority of mutations have no significant effect on an organism's fitness. Also, DNA repair mechanisms are able to mend most changes before they become permanent mutations, and many organisms have mechanisms for eliminating otherwise-permanently mutated . Beneficial mutations can improve reproductive success. Causes[] Main article: Four classes of mutations are (1) spontaneous mutations (molecular decay), (2) mutations due to error-prone replication bypass of (also called error-prone translesion synthesis), (3) errors introduced during DNA repair, and (4) induced mutations caused by . Scientists may also deliberately introduce sequences through DNA manipulation for the sake of scientific experimentation. One 2017 study claimed that 66% of cancer-causing mutations are random, 29% are due to the environment (the studied population spanned 69 countries), and 5% are inherited. Humans on average pass 60 new mutations to their children but fathers pass more mutations depending on their age with every year adding two new mutations to a child. Spontaneous mutation[] Spontaneous mutations occur with non-zero probability even given a healthy, uncontaminated cell. Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damage is estimated to occur 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 100,000 times per cell per day in . Spontaneous mutations can be characterized by the specific change: – A base is changed by the repositioning of a atom, altering the hydrogen bonding pattern of that base, resulting in incorrect during replication. Theoretical results suggest that is an important factor in the spontaneous creation of GC . – Loss of a base (A or G) to form an apurinic site (). – changes a normal base to an atypical base containing a group in place of the original group. Examples include C → U and A → HX (), which can be corrected by DNA repair mechanisms; and 5MeC () → T, which is less likely to be detected as a mutation because is a normal DNA base. – Denaturation of the new strand from the template during replication, followed by renaturation in a different spot (""slipping""). This can lead to insertions or deletions. Error-prone replication bypass[] There is increasing evidence that the majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error-prone replication () past DNA damage in the template strand. In , the majority of mutations are caused by translesion synthesis. Likewise, in , Kunz et al. found that more than 60% of the spontaneous single base pair substitutions and deletions were caused by translesion synthesis. Errors introduced during DNA repair[] See also: and Although naturally occurring double-strand breaks occur at a relatively low frequency in DNA, their repair often causes mutation. (NHEJ) is a major pathway for repairing double-strand breaks. NHEJ involves removal of a few to allow somewhat inaccurate alignment of the two ends for rejoining followed by addition of nucleotides to fill in gaps. As a consequence, NHEJ often introduces mutations. A between the of , the major in , and DNA Induced mutation[] Induced mutations are alterations in the gene after it has come in contact with mutagens and environmental causes. Induced mutations on the molecular level can be caused by: Chemicals (e.g., (BrdU)) (e.g., (ENU). These agents can mutate both replicating and non-replicating DNA. In contrast, a base analog can mutate the DNA only when the analog is incorporated in replicating the DNA. Each of these classes of chemical mutagens has certain effects that then lead to , , or deletions. Agents that form (e.g., ) DNA agents (e.g., ) converts amine groups on A and C to groups, altering their hydrogen bonding patterns, which leads to incorrect base pairing during replication. Radiation light (UV) (including ). Two nucleotide bases in DNA— and thymine—are most vulnerable to radiation that can change their properties. UV light can induce adjacent bases in a DNA strand to become covalently joined as a . UV radiation, in particular longer-wave UVA, can also cause . . Exposure to ionizing radiation, such as , can result in mutation, possibly resulting in cancer or death. Whereas in former times mutations were assumed to occur by chance, or induced by mutagens, molecular mechanisms of mutation have been discovered in bacteria and across the tree of life. As S. Rosenberg states, ""These mechanisms reveal a picture of highly regulated mutagenesis, up-regulated temporally by stress responses and activated when cells/organisms are maladapted to their environments—when stressed—potentially accelerating adaptation."" Since they are self-induced mutagenic mechanisms that increase the adaptation rate of organisms, they have some times been named as adaptive mutagenesis mechanisms, and include the SOS response in bacteria, ectopic intrachromosomal recombination and other chromosomal events such as duplications. Classification of types[] By effect on structure[] Five types of chromosomal mutations Types of small-scale mutations The sequence of a gene can be altered in a number of ways. Gene mutations have varying effects on health depending on where they occur and whether they alter the function of essential proteins. Mutations in the structure of genes can be classified into several types. Large-scale mutations[] See also: Large-scale mutations in structure include: Amplifications (or ) or repetition of a chromosomal segment or presence of extra piece of a chromosome broken piece of a chromosome may become attached to a homologous or non-homologous chromosome so that some of the genes are present in more than two doses leading to multiple copies of all chromosomal regions, increasing the dosage of the genes located within them. , duplication of entire sets of chromosomes, potentially resulting in a separate breeding population and . Deletions of large chromosomal regions, leading to loss of the genes within those regions. Mutations whose effect is to juxtapose previously separate pieces of DNA, potentially bringing together separate genes to form functionally distinct (e.g., ). Large scale changes to the structure of called that can lead to a decrease of fitness but also to speciation in isolated, inbred populations. These include: : interchange of genetic parts from nonhomologous chromosomes. : reversing the orientation of a chromosomal segment. Non-homologous . Interstitial deletions: an intra-chromosomal deletion that removes a segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human , a type of brain tumor, were found to have a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells). : loss of one , either by a deletion or a genetic recombination event, in an organism that previously had two different alleles. Small-scale mutations[] Small-scale mutations affect a gene in one or a few nucleotides. (If only a single nucleotide is affected, they are called .) Small-scale mutations include: add one or more extra nucleotides into the DNA. They are usually caused by , or errors during replication of repeating elements. Insertions in the coding region of a gene may alter of the (), or cause a shift in the (), both of which can significantly alter the . Insertions can be reversed by excision of the transposable element. remove one or more nucleotides from the DNA. Like insertions, these mutations can alter the reading frame of the gene. In general, they are irreversible: Though exactly the same sequence might, in theory, be restored by an insertion, transposable elements able to revert a very short deletion (say 1–2 bases) in any location either are highly unlikely to exist or do not exist at all. , often caused by chemicals or malfunction of DNA replication, exchange a single nucleotide for another. These changes are classified as transitions or transversions. Most common is the transition that exchanges a purine for a purine (A ↔ G) or a for a pyrimidine, (C ↔ T). A transition can be caused by nitrous acid, base mispairing, or mutagenic base analogs such as BrdU. Less common is a transversion, which exchanges a purine for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine for a purine (C/T ↔ A/G). An example of a transversion is the conversion of (A) into a cytosine (C). Point mutations are modifications of single base pairs of DNA or other small base pairs within a gene. A point mutation can be reversed by another point mutation, in which the nucleotide is changed back to its original state (true reversion) or by second-site reversion (a complementary mutation elsewhere that results in regained gene functionality). As discussed , point mutations that occur within the protein of a gene may be classified as or , the latter of which in turn can be divided into or . By impact on protein sequence[] The structure of a protein-coding gene. A mutation in the (red) can result in a change in the amino acid sequence. Mutations in other areas of the gene can have diverse effects. Changes within (yellow and blue) can effect and regulation of . Point mutations classified by impact on protein Selection of disease-causing mutations, in a standard table of the of The effect of a mutation on protein sequence depends in part on where in the genome it occurs, especially whether it is in a or . Mutations in the non-coding of a gene, such as promoters, enhancers, and silencers, can alter levels of gene expression, but are less likely to alter the protein sequence. Mutations within and in regions with no known biological function (e.g. , ) are generally , having no effect on phenotype – though intron mutations could alter the protein product if they affect mRNA splicing. Mutations that occur in coding regions of the genome are more likely to alter the protein product, and can be categorized by their effect on amino acid sequence: A is caused by insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not evenly divisible by three from a DNA sequence. Due to the triplet nature of gene expression by codons, the insertion or deletion can disrupt the reading frame, or the grouping of the codons, resulting in a completely different from the original. The earlier in the sequence the deletion or insertion occurs, the more altered the protein produced is. (For example, the code CCU GAC UAC CUA codes for the amino acids proline, aspartic acid, tyrosine, and leucine. If the U in CCU was deleted, the resulting sequence would be CCG ACU ACC UAx, which would instead code for proline, threonine, threonine, and part of another amino acid or perhaps a (where the x stands for the following nucleotide).) By contrast, any insertion or deletion that is evenly divisible by three is termed an in-frame mutation. A point substitution mutation results in a change in a single nucleotide and can be either synonymous or nonsynonymous. A replaces a codon with another codon that codes for the same amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is not modified. Synonymous mutations occur due to the nature of the . If this mutation does not result in any phenotypic effects, then it is called , but not all synonymous substitutions are silent. (There can also be silent mutations in nucleotides outside of the coding regions, such as the introns, because the exact nucleotide sequence is not as crucial as it is in the coding regions, but these are not considered synonymous substitutions.) A replaces a codon with another codon that codes for a different amino acid, so that the produced amino acid sequence is modified. Nonsynonymous substitutions can be classified as nonsense or missense mutations: A changes a nucleotide to cause substitution of a different amino acid. This in turn can render the resulting protein nonfunctional. Such mutations are responsible for diseases such as , , and -mediated . On the other hand, if a missense mutation occurs in an amino acid codon that results in the use of a different, but chemically similar, amino acid, then sometimes little or no change is rendered in the protein. For example, a change from AAA to AGA will encode , a chemically similar molecule to the intended . In this latter case the mutation will have little or no effect on phenotype and therefore be . A is a point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon, or a nonsense codon in the transcribed mRNA, and possibly a truncated, and often nonfunctional protein product. This sort of mutation has been linked to different diseases, such as . (See .) By effect on function[] A mutation becomes an effect on function mutation when the exactitude of functions between a mutated protein and its direct interactor undergoes change. The interactors can be other proteins, molecules, nucleic acids, etc. There are many mutations that fall under the category of by effect on function, but depending on the specificity of the change the mutations listed below will occur. Loss-of-function mutations, also called inactivating mutations, result in the gene product having less or no function (being partially or wholly inactivated). When the allele has a complete loss of function (), it is often called an or amorphic mutation in schema. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often . Exceptions are when the organism is , or when the reduced dosage of a normal gene product is not enough for a normal phenotype (this is called ). A disease that is caused by a loss-of-function mutation is Gitelman syndrome and cystic fibrosis. mutations also called activating mutations, change the gene product such that its effect gets stronger (enhanced activation) or even is superseded by a different and abnormal function. When the new allele is created, a containing the newly created allele as well as the original will express the new allele; genetically this defines the mutations as phenotypes. Several of Muller's morphs correspond to the gain of function, including hypermorph (increased gene expression) and neomorph (novel function). Dominant negative mutations (also called anti-morphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterized by a dominant or phenotype. In humans, dominant negative mutations have been implicated in cancer (e.g., mutations in genes , , , and ). is caused by mutations in the gene, located on , which encodes fibrillin-1, a component of the . Marfan syndrome is also an example of dominant negative mutation and haploinsufficiency. Lethal mutations result in the instant death of the developing organism. Lethal mutations can also lead to a substantial loss in the life expectancy of the organism. An example of a disease that is caused by a dominant lethal mutation is . Null mutations, also known as Amorphic mutations, are a form of loss-of-function mutations that completely prohibit the gene's function. The mutation leads to a complete loss of operation at the phenotypic level, also causing no gene product to be formed. and dermatitis syndrome are common diseases caused by a null mutation of the gene that activates filaggrin. Suppressor mutations are a type of mutation that causes the double mutation to appear normally. In suppressor mutations the phenotypic activity of a different mutation is completely suppressed, thus causing the double mutation to look normal. There are two types of suppressor mutations, there are and extragenic suppressor mutations. Intragenic mutations occur in the gene where the first mutation occurs, while extragenic mutations occur in the gene that interacts with the product of the first mutation. A common disease that results from this type of mutation is . Neomorphic mutations are a part of the gain-of-function mutations and are characterized by the control of new protein product synthesis. The newly synthesized gene normally contains a novel gene expression or molecular function. The result of the neomorphic mutation is the gene where the mutation occurs has a complete change in function. A back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype. By effect on fitness (harmful, beneficial, neutral mutations)[] See also: In genetics, it is sometimes useful to classify mutations as either harmful or beneficial (or neutral): A harmful, or deleterious, mutation decreases the fitness of the organism. Many, but not all mutations in are harmful (if a mutation does not change the amino acid sequence in an essential protein, it is harmless in most cases). A beneficial, or advantageous mutation increases the fitness of the organism. Examples are mutations that lead to in bacteria (which are beneficial for bacteria but usually not for humans). A neutral mutation has no harmful or beneficial effect on the organism. Such mutations occur at a steady rate, forming the basis for the . In the , neutral mutations provide genetic drift as the basis for most variation at the molecular level. In animals or plants, most mutations are neutral, given that the vast majority of their genomes is either non-coding or consists of repetitive sequences that have no obvious function (""""). Large-scale quantitative mutagenesis screens, in which thousands of millions of mutations are tested, invariably find that a larger fraction of mutations has harmful effects but always returns a number of beneficial mutations as well. For instance, in a screen of all gene deletions in , 80% of mutations were negative, but 20% were positive, even though many had a very small effect on growth (depending on condition). Gene deletions involve removal of whole genes, so that point mutations almost always have a much smaller effect. In a similar screen in , but this time with transposon insertions, 76% of insertion mutants were classified as neutral, 16% had a significantly reduced fitness, but 6% were advantageous. This classification is obviously relative and somewhat artificial: a harmful mutation can quickly turn into a beneficial mutations when conditions change. Also, there is a gradient from harmful/beneficial to neutral, as many mutations may have small and mostly neglectable effects but under certain conditions will become relevant. Also, many traits are determined by hundreds of genes (or loci), so that each locus has only a minor effect. For instance, human height is determined by hundreds of genetic variants (""mutations"") but each of them has a very minor effect on height, apart from the impact of . Height (or size) itself may be more or less beneficial as the huge range of sizes in animal or plant groups shows. Distribution of fitness effects (DFE)[] Attempts have been made to infer the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) using experiments and theoretical models applied to molecular sequence data. DFE, as used to determine the relative abundance of different types of mutations (i.e., strongly deleterious, nearly neutral or advantageous), is relevant to many evolutionary questions, such as the maintenance of , the rate of , the maintenance of as opposed to and the evolution of and . DFE can also be tracked by tracking the skewness of the distribution of mutations with putatively severe effects as compared to the distribution of mutations with putatively mild or absent effect. In summary, the DFE plays an important role in predicting . A variety of approaches have been used to study the DFE, including theoretical, experimental and analytical methods. Mutagenesis experiment: The direct method to investigate the DFE is to induce mutations and then measure the mutational fitness effects, which has already been done in viruses, , yeast, and Drosophila. For example, most studies of the DFE in viruses used to create point mutations and measure relative fitness of each mutant. In , one study used to directly measure the fitness of a random insertion of a derivative of . In yeast, a combined mutagenesis and approach has been developed to generate high-quality systematic mutant libraries and measure fitness in high throughput. However, given that many mutations have effects too small to be detected and that mutagenesis experiments can detect only mutations of moderately large effect; DNA can provide valuable information about these mutations. The distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of mutations in . In this experiment, random mutations were introduced into the virus by site-directed mutagenesis, and the of each mutant was compared with the ancestral type. A fitness of zero, less than one, one, more than one, respectively, indicates that mutations are lethal, deleterious, neutral, and advantageous. This figure shows a simplified version of loss-of-function, switch-of-function, gain-of-function, and conservation-of-function mutations.Molecular sequence analysis: With rapid development of technology, an enormous amount of DNA sequence data is available and even more is forthcoming in the future. Various methods have been developed to infer the DFE from DNA sequence data. By examining DNA sequence differences within and between species, we are able to infer various characteristics of the DFE for neutral, deleterious and advantageous mutations. To be specific, the DNA sequence analysis approach allows us to estimate the effects of mutations with very small effects, which are hardly detectable through mutagenesis experiments. One of the earliest theoretical studies of the distribution of fitness effects was done by , an influential theoretical population . His neutral theory of proposes that most novel mutations will be highly deleterious, with a small fraction being neutral. A later proposal by Hiroshi Akashi proposed a model for the DFE, with modes centered around highly deleterious and neutral mutations. Both theories agree that the vast majority of novel mutations are neutral or deleterious and that advantageous mutations are rare, which has been supported by experimental results. One example is a study done on the DFE of random mutations in . Out of all mutations, 39.6% were lethal, 31.2% were non-lethal deleterious, and 27.1% were neutral. Another example comes from a high throughput mutagenesis experiment with yeast. In this experiment it was shown that the overall DFE is bimodal, with a cluster of neutral mutations, and a broad distribution of deleterious mutations. Though relatively few mutations are advantageous, those that are play an important role in evolutionary changes. Like neutral mutations, weakly selected advantageous mutations can be lost due to random genetic drift, but strongly selected advantageous mutations are more likely to be fixed. Knowing the DFE of advantageous mutations may lead to increased ability to predict the evolutionary dynamics. Theoretical work on the DFE for advantageous mutations has been done by and . They proposed that the distribution for advantageous mutations should be under a wide range of conditions, which, in general, has been supported by experimental studies, at least for strongly selected advantageous mutations. In general, it is accepted that the majority of mutations are neutral or deleterious, with advantageous mutations being rare; however, the proportion of types of mutations varies between species. This indicates two important points: first, the proportion of effectively neutral mutations is likely to vary between species, resulting from dependence on ; second, the average effect of deleterious mutations varies dramatically between species. In addition, the DFE also differs between coding regions and , with the DFE of noncoding DNA containing more weakly selected mutations. By inheritance[] A mutation has caused this plant to produce flowers of different colors. This is a mutation that may also be passed on in the . In with dedicated , mutations can be subdivided into , which can be passed on to descendants through their reproductive cells, and mutations (also called acquired mutations), which involve cells outside the dedicated reproductive group and which are not usually transmitted to descendants. Diploid organisms (e.g., humans) contain two copies of each gene—a paternal and a maternal allele. Based on the occurrence of mutation on each chromosome, we may classify mutations into three types. A or homozygous non-mutated organism is one in which neither allele is mutated. A heterozygous mutation is a mutation of only one allele. A homozygous mutation is an identical mutation of both the paternal and maternal alleles. mutations or a genetic compound consists of two different mutations in the paternal and maternal alleles. Germline mutation[] Further information: A germline mutation in the reproductive cells of an individual gives rise to a constitutional mutation in the offspring, that is, a mutation that is present in every cell. A constitutional mutation can also occur very soon after , or continue from a previous constitutional mutation in a parent. A germline mutation can be passed down through subsequent generations of organisms. The distinction between germline and somatic mutations is important in animals that have a dedicated germline to produce reproductive cells. However, it is of little value in understanding the effects of mutations in plants, which lack a dedicated germline. The distinction is also blurred in those animals that through mechanisms such as , because the cells that give rise to the daughter organisms also give rise to that organism's germline. A new germline mutation not inherited from either parent is called a mutation. Somatic mutation[] Main article: A change in the genetic structure that is not inherited from a parent, and also not passed to offspring, is called a mutation. Somatic mutations are not inherited by an organism's offspring because they do not affect the . However, they are passed down to all the progeny of a mutated cell within the same organism during mitosis. A major section of an organism therefore might carry the same mutation. These types of mutations are usually prompted by environmental causes, such as ultraviolet radiation or any exposure to certain harmful chemicals, and can cause diseases including cancer. With plants, some somatic mutations can be propagated without the need for seed production, for example, by and stem cuttings. These type of mutation have led to new types of fruits, such as the ""Delicious"" and the ""Washington"" navel . Human and mouse have a mutation rate more than ten times higher than the mutation rate for both species; mice have a higher rate of both somatic and germline mutations per than humans. The disparity in mutation rate between the germline and somatic tissues likely reflects the greater importance of maintenance in the germline than in the soma. Special classes[] Conditional mutation is a mutation that has wild-type (or less severe) phenotype under certain ""permissive"" environmental conditions and a mutant phenotype under certain ""restrictive"" conditions. For example, a temperature-sensitive mutation can cause cell death at high temperature (restrictive condition), but might have no deleterious consequences at a lower temperature (permissive condition). These mutations are non-autonomous, as their manifestation depends upon presence of certain conditions, as opposed to other mutations which appear autonomously. The permissive conditions may be temperature, certain chemicals, light or mutations in other parts of the genome. mechanisms like transcriptional switches can create conditional mutations. For instance, association of Steroid Binding Domain can create a transcriptional switch that can change the expression of a gene based on the presence of a steroid ligand. Conditional mutations have applications in research as they allow control over gene expression. This is especially useful studying diseases in adults by allowing expression after a certain period of growth, thus eliminating the deleterious effect of gene expression seen during stages of development in model organisms. DNA Recombinase systems like Cre-Lox recombination used in association with promoters that are activated under certain conditions can generate conditional mutations. Dual Recombinase technology can be used to induce multiple conditional mutations to study the diseases which manifest as a result of simultaneous mutations in multiple genes. Certain inteins have been identified which splice only at certain permissive temperatures, leading to improper protein synthesis and thus, loss-of-function mutations at other temperatures. Conditional mutations may also be used in genetic studies associated with ageing, as the expression can be changed after a certain time period in the organism's lifespan. affects DNA replication. Nomenclature[] In order to categorize a mutation as such, the ""normal"" sequence must be obtained from the DNA of a ""normal"" or ""healthy"" organism (as opposed to a ""mutant"" or ""sick"" one), it should be identified and reported; ideally, it should be made publicly available for a straightforward nucleotide-by-nucleotide comparison, and agreed upon by the scientific community or by a group of expert geneticists and , who have the responsibility of establishing the standard or so-called ""consensus"" sequence. This step requires a tremendous scientific effort. Once the consensus sequence is known, the mutations in a genome can be pinpointed, described, and classified. The committee of the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) has developed the standard human sequence variant nomenclature, which should be used by researchers and centers to generate unambiguous mutation descriptions. In principle, this nomenclature can also be used to describe mutations in other organisms. The nomenclature specifies the type of mutation and base or amino acid changes. Nucleotide substitution (e.g., 76A>T) – The number is the position of the nucleotide from the 5' end; the first letter represents the wild-type nucleotide, and the second letter represents the nucleotide that replaced the wild type. In the given example, the adenine at the 76th position was replaced by a thymine. If it becomes necessary to differentiate between mutations in , , and , a simple convention is used. For example, if the 100th base of a nucleotide sequence mutated from G to C, then it would be written as g.100G>C if the mutation occurred in genomic DNA, m.100G>C if the mutation occurred in mitochondrial DNA, or r.100g>c if the mutation occurred in RNA. Note that, for mutations in RNA, the nucleotide code is written in lower case. Amino acid substitution (e.g., D111E) – The first letter is the one letter of the wild-type amino acid, the number is the position of the amino acid from the , and the second letter is the one letter code of the amino acid present in the mutation. Nonsense mutations are represented with an X for the second amino acid (e.g. D111X). Amino acid deletion (e.g., ΔF508) – The Greek letter Δ () indicates a deletion. The letter refers to the amino acid present in the wild type and the number is the position from the N terminus of the amino acid were it to be present as in the wild type. Mutation rates[] Further information: and vary substantially across species, and the evolutionary forces that generally determine mutation are the subject of ongoing investigation. In humans, the mutation rate is about 50–90 de novo mutations per genome per generation, that is, each human accumulates about 50–90 novel mutations that were not present in his or her parents. This number has been established by sequencing thousands of human trios, that is, two parents and at least one child. The genomes of are based on rather than DNA. The RNA viral genome can be double-stranded (as in DNA) or single-stranded. In some of these viruses (such as the single-stranded ), replication occurs quickly, and there are no mechanisms to check the genome for accuracy. This error-prone process often results in mutations. Randomness of mutations[] There is a widespread assumption that mutations are (entirely) ""random"" with respect to their consequences (in terms of probability). This was shown to be wrong as mutation frequency can vary across regions of the genome, with such - and mutation-biases being associated with various factors. For instance, biologically important regions were found to be protected from mutations and mutations beneficial to the studied plant were found to be more likely – i.e. mutation is ""non-random in a way that benefits the plant"". Additionally, previous experiments typically used to demonstrate mutations being random with respect to fitness (such as the and ) have been shown to only support the weaker claim that those mutations are random with respect to external selective constraints, not fitness as a whole. Disease causation[] Changes in DNA caused by mutation in a coding region of DNA can cause errors in protein sequence that may result in partially or completely non-functional proteins. Each cell, in order to function correctly, depends on thousands of proteins to function in the right places at the right times. When a mutation alters a protein that plays a critical role in the body, a medical condition can result. One study on the comparison of genes between different species of Drosophila suggests that if a mutation does change a protein, the mutation will most likely be harmful, with an estimated 70 percent of amino acid polymorphisms having damaging effects, and the remainder being either neutral or weakly beneficial. Some mutations alter a gene's DNA base sequence but do not change the protein made by the gene. Studies have shown that only 7% of point mutations in noncoding DNA of yeast are deleterious and 12% in coding DNA are deleterious. The rest of the mutations are either neutral or slightly beneficial. Inherited disorders[] See also: If a mutation is present in a , it can give rise to offspring that carries the mutation in all of its cells. This is the case in hereditary diseases. In particular, if there is a mutation in a DNA repair gene within a germ cell, humans carrying such germline mutations may have an increased risk of cancer. A list of 34 such germline mutations is given in the article . An example of one is , a mutation that occurs in the or gene. Individuals with this disorder are more prone to many types of cancers, other disorders and have impaired vision. DNA damage can cause an error when the DNA is replicated, and this error of replication can cause a gene mutation that, in turn, could cause a genetic disorder. DNA damages are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. Each cell has a number of pathways through which enzymes recognize and repair damages in DNA. Because DNA can be damaged in many ways, the process of DNA repair is an important way in which the body protects itself from disease. Once DNA damage has given rise to a mutation, the mutation cannot be repaired. Role in carcinogenesis[] See also: On the other hand, a mutation may occur in a somatic cell of an organism. Such mutations will be present in all descendants of this cell within the same organism. The accumulation of certain mutations over generations of somatic cells is part of cause of , from normal cell to cancer cell. Cells with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations (one good copy of gene and one mutated copy) may function normally with the unmutated copy until the good copy has been spontaneously somatically mutated. This kind of mutation happens often in living organisms, but it is difficult to measure the rate. Measuring this rate is important in predicting the rate at which people may develop cancer. Point mutations may arise from spontaneous mutations that occur during DNA replication. The rate of mutation may be increased by mutagens. Mutagens can be physical, such as radiation from , or extreme heat, or chemical (molecules that misplace base pairs or disrupt the helical shape of DNA). Mutagens associated with cancers are often studied to learn about cancer and its prevention. Prion mutations[] are proteins and do not contain genetic material. However, prion replication has been shown to be subject to mutation and natural selection just like other forms of replication. The human gene codes for the major prion protein, PrP, and is subject to mutations that can give rise to disease-causing prions. Beneficial mutations[] Although mutations that cause changes in protein sequences can be harmful to an organism, on occasions the effect may be positive in a given environment. In this case, the mutation may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild-type organisms, or reproduce more quickly. In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection. Examples include the following: HIV resistance: a specific 32 base pair deletion in human CCR5 (CCR5-Δ32) confers HIV resistance to homozygotes and delays AIDS onset in heterozygotes. One possible explanation of the etiology of the relatively high frequency of CCR5-Δ32 in the European population is that it conferred resistance to the bubonic plague in mid-14th century Europe. People with this mutation were more likely to survive infection; thus its frequency in the population increased. This theory could explain why this mutation is not found in Southern Africa, which remained untouched by bubonic plague. A newer theory suggests that the selective pressure on the CCR5 Delta 32 mutation was caused by smallpox instead of the bubonic plague. Malaria resistance: An example of a harmful mutation is sickle-cell disease, a blood disorder in which the body produces an abnormal type of the oxygen-carrying substance hemoglobin in the red blood cells. One-third of all indigenous inhabitants of Sub-Saharan Africa carry the allele, because, in areas where malaria is common, there is a survival value in carrying only a single sickle-cell allele (sickle cell trait). Those with only one of the two alleles of the sickle-cell disease are more resistant to malaria, since the infestation of the malaria is halted by the sickling of the cells that it infests. Antibiotic resistance: Practically all bacteria develop antibiotic resistance when exposed to antibiotics. In fact, bacterial populations already have such mutations that get selected under antibiotic selection. Obviously, such mutations are only beneficial for the bacteria but not for those infected. . A mutation allowed humans to express the enzyme lactase after they are naturally weaned from breast milk, allowing adults to digest lactose, which is likely one of the most beneficial mutations in recent human evolution. Compensated pathogenic deviations[] Compensated pathogenic deviations refer to amino acid residues in a protein sequence that are pathogenic in one species but are wild type residues in the functionally equivalent protein in another species. Although the amino acid residue is pathogenic in the first species, it is not so in the second species because its pathogenicity is compensated by one or more amino acid substitutions in the second species. The compensatory mutation can occur in the same protein or in another protein with which it interacts. It is critical to understand the effects of compensatory mutations in the context of fixed deleterious mutations due to the population fitness decreasing because of fixation. Effective population size refers to a population that is reproducing. An increase in this population size has been correlated with a decreased rate of genetic"

Overview A genetic mutation is a change to your DNA sequence by removing, adding or replacing pieces of your DNA. What are genetic mutations? A genetic mutation is a change in a sequence of your DNA. Your DNA sequence gives your cells the information they need to perform their functions. If part of your DNA sequence is in the wrong place, isn’t complete or is damaged, you might experience symptoms of a genetic condition. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. When do genetic mutations happen? Genetic mutations occur during cell division when your cells divide and replicate. There are two types of cell division: Mitosis: The process of making new cells for your body. During mitosis, your genes instruct your cells to split into two by making a copy of your chromosomes. Meiosis: The process of making egg and sperm cells for the next generation. During meiosis, chromosomes copy themselves with half the amount of chromosomes as the original (from 46 to 23). That’s how you’re able to get your genetic material equally from each parent. How do genetic mutations happen? Genetic mutations occur during cell division. When your cells divide, they hand-write your body’s instruction manual by copying the original document word for word. There’s a lot of room for error during cell division because your cells might substitute (replace), delete (remove) or insert (add) letters while they’re copying. If you have an error (genetic mutation), your genetic instruction manual for your cells may not be readable by the cells, or may have missing parts or unnecessary parts added. All of this can mean that your cells can’t function as they normally should. Function How do genetic mutations affect other organs? A genetic mutation changes the information your cells need to form and function. Your genes are responsible for making proteins that tell your body what physical characteristics you should have. If you have a genetic mutation, you could experience symptoms of a genetic condition because your cells are doing a different job than they should be. Symptoms of genetic conditions depend on which gene has a mutation. There are many different diseases and conditions caused by mutations. The signs and symptoms you experience could include: Physical characteristics like facial abnormalities, a cleft palate, webbed fingers and toes, or short stature. Problems with cognitive (intellectual) function and developmental delays. Vision or hearing loss. Breathing problems. Increased risk of developing cancer. Are genetic mutations bad? Not all genetic mutations lead to genetic disorders. Some genetic mutations don’t have any effect on your health and well-being. This is because the change in the DNA sequence doesn’t change how your cell functions. Your body also has enzymes, which are a substance that creates chemical reactions in our body. These enzymes help your body protect itself from disease. Enzymes can repair a variety of genetic mutations before they affect how a cell functions. Some genetic mutations even have a positive effect on humans. Changes in how cells work can sometimes improve the proteins that your cells produce and allow them to adapt to changes in your environment. An example of a positive genetic mutation is one that can protect a person from acquiring heart disease or diabetes, even with a history of smoking or being overweight. How do genetic mutations lead to genetic variations? A genetic mutation is a change to a gene’s DNA sequence to produce something different. It creates a permanent change to that gene’s DNA sequence. Genetic variations are important for humans to evolve, which is the process of change over generations. A sporadic genetic mutation occurs in one person. That person passes their genetic mutation onto their children (hereditary), and it continues for generations. If the mutation improves that person’s chance of survival, or freedom from disease, then it begins being passed through generations and spread through the population. As the mutation passes from generation to generation, it becomes a normal part of the human genome and evolves from a gene variant into a normal gene. Anatomy Where are genes in my body? Genes reside on thread-like structures in your body called chromosomes. Chromosomes are in each cell in your body. There are trillions of cells in your body that make you who you are. What are the different types of genetic mutations? There are different types of genetic mutations based on where they form. Types of genetic mutations include: Germline mutation: A change in a gene that occurs in a parent’s reproductive cells (egg or sperm) that affects the genetic makeup of their child (hereditary). Somatic mutation: A change in a gene that occurs after conception in the developing embryo that may become a baby. These occur in all cells in the developing body — except the sperm and egg. Somatic mutations can’t pass from parents to their children (hereditary) because traits are passed only from the sperm and egg. Can I inherit genetic mutations? Yes, you can inherit germline genetic mutations, while somatic mutations occur with no previous history of the mutation in your family. There are several patterns that genetic mutations can pass from the parent to a child (hereditary). Pattern of inheritanceSummaryExample of genetic conditionsPattern of inheritanceSummaryExample of genetic conditionsAutosomal dominantSummaryOnly one parent needs to pass the genetic mutation onto their child for their child to inherit the mutation.Example of genetic conditionsAutosomal recessiveSummaryBoth parents need to pass the same genetic mutation onto their child for their child to inherit the mutation.Example of genetic conditionsX-linked dominantSummaryBabies assigned male or female have an X chromosome. Only one mutation on the X chromosome needs to pass from one parent to the child for the child to inherit the mutation.Example of genetic conditionsX-linked recessiveSummaryIf only dad has the mutation, there’s 100% that female offspring will be carriers and no male offspring will be affected. If only mom the mutation, there’s a 50% chance that female offspring will be carriers and a 50% chance male offspring will have the condition. If both parents have the mutation, 50% of male offspring will have the condition and 100% of female offspring will have the mutation.Example of genetic conditionsX-linkedSummaryBabies assigned male or female have an X chromosome. Mutations on the X chromosome can pass in a dominant or recessive pattern, but not every pattern is clear on how the child acquired the mutation from their parents.Example of genetic conditionsY-linkedSummaryOnly babies assigned male at birth have a Y chromosome and can inherit this type. Only one mutation on the Y chromosome needs to pass to the child to inherit the mutation.Example of genetic conditionsWebbed toesCodominantSummaryEach gene has two parts (one from the egg and one from the sperm). They usually work together to create a single trait. But sometimes, they each work separately to produce variations of the trait.Example of genetic conditionsMitochondrialSummaryThe mitochondria are the part of a cell that creates energy. Only mitochondria from the egg survive fertilization, when the two cells come together. So, all maternal DNA in the embryo come from the egg. This is why mitochondrial inheritance is also known as maternal inheritance.Example of genetic conditions Conditions and Disorders What are genetic disorders? A genetic disorder is a condition caused by changes in your genome, or the genetic material present in a human. It includes your DNA, genes and chromosomes. Several factors cause genetic conditions, including: Mutation of one gene (monogenic). Mutation of multiple genes (multifactorial inheritance). Mutation of one or more chromosomes. Environmental factors (chemical exposure, UV rays) that change your genetic makeup. You can inherit the genetic condition from your parents (if it’s germ cell DNA in the sperm or egg) or the genetic condition can happen randomly, without having a history of the genetic condition in your family. What are common genetic disorders? There are thousands of genetic conditions that exist. Some of the most common genetic conditions are: Alzheimer’s disease. Some cancers. Cystic fibrosis. Down syndrome. Sickle cell disease. Is there a test that checks for genetic mutations? If your healthcare provider suspects that you have a genetic condition or you’re at risk of having a child with a genetic condition, they may offer a genetic test. There are many genetic tests that require a sample of your blood, skin, hair, amniotic fluid or tissues to identify changes to your genes, chromosomes or proteins. Genetic testing can locate mutated genes or chromosomes that cause genetic conditions. These tests can also let you know if you’re at risk of having a child with a genetic"

All of the offspring’s cells will carry the mutated , which often confers some serious malfunction, as in the case of a human genetic disease such as .Why does mutation occur?Mutations in occur for different reasons. For example, environmental factors, such as exposure to ultraviolet radiation or certain chemicals, can induce changes in the DNA sequence. Mutations can also occur because of hereditary factors.What are mutation hotspots?Mutation hotspots (or mutational hotspots) are segments of that are especially prone to genetic alteration. The increased susceptibility of these areas of DNA to mutation is attributed to interactions between mutation-inducing factors, the structure and function of the DNA sequence, and enzymes involved in DNA repair, replication, and modification.mutation, an in the genetic material (the ) of a of a living organism or of a that is more or less permanent and that can be transmitted to the cell’s or the virus’s descendants. (The genomes of organisms are all composed of , whereas viral genomes can be of DNA or ; see .) Mutation in the DNA of a body cell of a () may be transmitted to descendant cells by DNA replication and hence result in a sector or patch of cells having abnormal function, an example being . Mutations in egg or sperm cells () may result in an individual offspring all of whose cells carry the mutation, which often confers some serious malfunction, as in the case of a such as . Mutations result either from accidents during the normal chemical transactions of DNA, often during replication, or from exposure to high-energy electromagnetic (e.g., or X-rays) or particle radiation or to highly reactive chemicals in the . Because mutations are random changes, they are expected to be mostly , but some may be in certain . In general, mutation is the main source of genetic variation, which is the raw material for by .Know how a single change in the DNA nucleotide results in mutation and why some mutations are harmfulThe genome is composed of one to several long molecules of DNA, and mutation can occur potentially anywhere on these molecules at any time. The most serious changes take place in the functional units of DNA, the . A mutated form of a is called a . A gene is typically composed of a regulatory region, which is responsible for turning the gene’s transcription on and off at the appropriate times during development, and a coding region, which carries the for the structure of a functional molecule, generally a . A protein is a chain of usually several hundred . Cells make 20 common amino acids, and it is the number and sequence of these that give a protein its specific function. Each amino acid is encoded by a unique sequence, or , of three of the four possible base pairs in the DNA (A–T, T–A, G–C, and C–G, the individual letters referring to the four nitrogenous bases , , , and ). Hence, a mutation that changes DNA sequence can change amino acid sequence and in this way potentially reduce or inactivate a protein’s function. A change in the DNA sequence of a gene’s regulatory region can adversely affect the timing and availability of the gene’s protein and also lead to serious cellular malfunction. On the other hand, many mutations are silent, showing no obvious effect at the functional level. Some are in the DNA between genes, or they are of a type that results in no significant amino acid changes.Mutations are of several types. Changes within genes are called . The simplest kinds are changes to single base pairs, called base-pair substitutions. Many of these substitute an incorrect amino acid in the corresponding position in the protein, and of these a large proportion result in altered protein function. Some base-pair substitutions produce a stop codon. Normally, when a stop codon occurs at the end of a gene, it stops , but, when it occurs in an abnormal position, it can result in a truncated and nonfunctional protein. Another type of simple change, the deletion or insertion of single base pairs, generally has a profound effect on the protein because the protein’s synthesis, which is carried out by the reading of triplet codons in a linear fashion from one end of the gene to the other, is thrown off. This change leads to a frameshift in reading the gene such that all amino acids are incorrect from the mutation onward. More-complex combinations of base , insertions, and deletions can also be observed in some mutant genes.Mutations that span more than one gene are called because they affect the structure, function, and inheritance of whole DNA molecules (microscopically visible in a coiled state as ). Often these mutations result from one or more coincident breaks in the DNA molecules of the genome (possibly from exposure to energetic radiation), followed in some cases by faulty rejoining. Some outcomes are large-scale deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. In a diploid (a species, such as beings, that has a double set of chromosomes in the nucleus of each cell), deletions and duplications alter gene balance and often result in abnormality. and translocations involve no loss or gain and are functionally normal unless a break occurs within a gene. However, at (the specialized nuclear divisions that take place during the production of —i.e., eggs and sperm), faulty pairing of an inverted or translocated chromosome set with a normal set can result in gametes and hence progeny with duplications and deletions.Loss or gain of whole chromosomes results in a condition called . One familiar result of aneuploidy is , a in which humans are born with an extra chromosome 21 (and hence bear three copies of that chromosome instead of the usual two). Another type of chromosome mutation is the gain or loss of whole chromosome sets. Gain of sets results in —that is, the presence of three, four, or more chromosome sets instead of the usual two. Polyploidy has been a significant force in the evolution of new species of plants and animals. (See also .)Most genomes contain mobile DNA elements that move from one location to another. The movement of these elements can cause mutation, either because the element arrives in some crucial location, such as within a gene, or because it promotes large-scale chromosome mutations via recombination between pairs of mobile elements in different locations.

At the level of whole populations of organisms, mutation can be viewed as a constantly dripping faucet introducing mutant alleles into the population, a described as mutational pressure. The rate of mutation differs for different genes and organisms. In RNA viruses, such as the (HIV; see ), replication of the genome takes place within the host cell using a mechanism that is prone to error. Hence, mutation rates in such viruses are high. In general, however, the fate of individual is never certain. Most are eliminated by chance. In some cases a mutant allele can increase in frequency by chance, and then individuals expressing the allele can be subject to selection, either positive or negative. Hence, for any one gene the frequency of a mutant allele in a population is determined by a combination of mutational pressure, selection, and chance. Load Next Page Feedback Corrections? Updates?

Gene Changes and Cancer On this page The human body is made up of trillions of cells - the basic building blocks of any complex animal. These cells normally work together to form organs, such as the heart, liver, and skin. In order for cells to work together, they have to have certain traits or characteristics. For example, they need to be able to divide to make new cells at the right time, stay where they’re needed, and not crowd out nearby cells. Cancer begins when cells in the body become abnormal and start to grow out of control. This is caused by certain changes in a cell’s genes. What are genes? Genes are pieces of DNA inside each cell. They tell the cell how to make the proteins it needs to function. Each gene contains the code (instructions) to make a certain protein, and each protein has a specific job. For example, some genes code for proteins that help the cell grow and divide to make new cells. Other genes code for proteins that help keep cell growth under control. Genes are contained in chromosomes, which are long strands of DNA in each cell. Each chromosome has many different genes. Most human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome of each pair is inherited from a person’s mother, and the other comes from their father. This is why children tend to look like their parents, and why they may have a tendency to develop certain diseases that run in their families. All the cells in the body have the same genes, but each cell uses only the genes it needs. That is, it turns on (activates) the genes it needs at the right time and turns off other genes that it doesn't need. Turning on some genes and turning off others is how a cell becomes specialized, such as becoming a muscle cell or a bone cell, for example. Some genes stay active all the time to make proteins needed for basic cell functions. Other genes are shut down when their job is finished and can be turned on again later if needed. Changes in genes While we all have basically the same set of genes, we also have differences in our genes that make each of us unique. The ‘code’ or ‘blueprint’ for each gene is contained in chemicals called nucleotides. DNA is made up of 4 nucleotides (A, T, G, and C), which act like the letters of an alphabet. Each gene is made up of a long chain of nucleotides, the order of which tells the cell how to make a specific protein. Gene variants and mutations Some people have changes in the nucleotides of a gene, which are known as variants (or mutations). For example, one nucleotide ‘letter’ might be switched for another, or one or more letters might be missing, when compared to most other people’s genes. Gene variants can have different effects on the proteins they code for. For example: Some gene variants might not have any noticeable effect on the protein. Some variants might lead to very minor changes in the protein. For example, a variant might result in a protein that’s shaped a little differently and is therefore a bit less effective than the ‘normal’ version of the protein. Some variants might have larger effects. For example, a variant might result in a protein that doesn’t work at all. Gene variants that lead to changes in proteins can affect all of the cells with that variant, which might even affect the whole body. The overall effects of some﻿ gene variants might not necessarily be ‘good’ or ‘bad.’ For example, gene variants account for differences in people’s hair or eye color. On the other hand, some variants can lead to a disease (such as cancer) or increase the risk of a disease. These are referred to as pathogenic variants. (These are also what many people think of when they hear the term mutation.) Inherited versus acquired gene mutations Gene variants, including mutations, can be either inherited or acquired. An inherited gene mutation, as the name implies, is inherited from a parent, so it’s present in the very first cell (once the egg cell is fertilized by a sperm cell) that eventually becomes a person. Since all the cells in the body came from this first cell, this mutation is in every cell in the body, and can also be passed on to the next generation. This type of mutation is also called a germline mutation (because the cells that develop into eggs and sperm are called germ cells) or a hereditary mutation. It typically takes more than one gene mutation for a cell to become a cancer cell. But when someone inherits an abnormal copy of a gene, their cells already start out with one mutation. This makes it easier (and quicker) for other mutations to happen, which can lead to a cell becoming a cancer cell. This is why cancers related to inherited mutations tend to occur earlier in life than cancers of the same type that are not inherited. Inherited gene mutations are not the main cause of most cancers. To learn about some of the more common inherited gene mutations that can lead to cancer, see . An acquired gene mutation is not inherited from a parent. Instead, it develops at some point during a person's life. Acquired mutations occur in one cell, and then are passed on to any new cells that come from that cell. This mutation cannot be passed on to a person's children, because it doesn’t affect their sperm or egg cells. This type of mutation is also called a sporadic mutation or a somatic mutation. Acquired mutations can happen for different reasons. Sometimes they happen when a cell’s DNA is damaged, such as after being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals. But often these mutations occur randomly, without having an outside cause. For example, during the complex process when a cell divides to make 2 new cells, the cell must make another copy of all of its DNA, and sometimes mistakes (mutations) occur while this is happening. Every time a cell divides is another chance for gene mutations to occur. The number of mutations in our cells can build up over time, which is why we have a higher risk of cancer as we get older. Acquired gene mutations are a much more common cause of cancer than inherited mutations. Other ways gene activity can be changed Some of the changes inside cells that can lead to cancer don’t involve gene variants or mutations. Cells can turn some of their genes on and off in other ways, and some of these might also affect how a cell grows and divides. As mentioned earlier, different genes are more active in some cells than in others. Even within a certain cell, some genes are active at some times and inactive at others. Turning these genes on and off isn’t done by changing the DNA sequence (as is the case with variants and mutations). Instead, the changes in gene activity occur by other means known as epigenetic changes. There are several types of these changes: DNA methylation: In this type of change, a small chemical group called a methyl group is attached to the DNA so that the gene can’t start the process of making the protein it codes for. This basically turns off the gene. On the other hand, removing the methyl group (in a process called demethylation) can turn a gene on. Histone acetylation/histone modification: Chromosomes are made up of strands of DNA wrapped around proteins called histones. Histone proteins can be changed by adding (or subtracting) a small chemical group called an acetyl group. Adding acetyl groups (acetylation) can activate (turn on) that part of the chromosome, while taking them away (deacetylation) can deactivate it (turn it off). Drugs called histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can help in the treatment of some types of cancer by turning on genes that help control cell growth and division. RNA interference: Inside each cell, DNA acts as long-term storage for our genes. But DNA isn’t in the same part of the cell where proteins are made. For a protein to be made, a copy of its genetic code (in the form of messenger RNA, or mRNA), needs to be made from the DNA first. This piece of mRNA can then bring the instructions to the part of the cell where proteins are made. mRNA is only used for a short time to make the protein, and then it’s broken down. If the cell needs more of that protein, it makes more mRNA. RNA interference is another way cells can turn off genes. A cell can make other forms of RNA that stick to mRNA. This can cause the mRNA to break down or stop it from delivering its code. Drugs are being developed to target the forms of RNA involved in RNA interference. This might help turn off specific genes that cause cancer. How changes in genes can affect cancer risk Some genes normally help control when our cells grow, divide to make new cells, repair mistakes in DNA, or cause cells to die when they’re supposed to. If these genes aren’t working properly, it can affect cancer risk. For example: Changes in genes that normally help cells grow, divide, or stay alive can lead to these genes being more active than they should be, causing them to become oncogenes. These genes can result in cells growing out of control. Genes that normally help keep cell division under control or cause cells to die at the right time are known as tumor suppressor genes. Changes that turn off these genes can result in cells growing out of control. Some genes normally help repair mistakes in a cell’s DNA. Changes that turn off these DNA repair genes can result in the buildup of DNA changes within a cell, which might lead to them growing out of control. DNA changes that create oncogenes or that turn off tumor suppressor genes or DNA repair genes might lead to cancer, although typically it takes several gene changes before a cell becomes a cancer cell. To learn more, see . Changes in some other genes don’t lead to cancer directly, but they might still make someone more likely to get cancer. For example, some gene changes can limit how well the body breaks down some of the toxins in tobacco smoke. Among people who smoke, people with these kinds of gene changes might be more likely to get lung and other smoking-related cancers. Gene changes can also play a role in other conditions that might impact cancer risk. For example, some gene variants can affect body weight. People with extra body weight are more likely to get some types of cancer, so these variants might also indirectly affect cancer risk. Gene variants and other changes are common. We all have them, and their effects can add up to influence our cancer risk.

0,biologyonline,DNA Mutation and Repair,https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/mutation,"Mutation - Definition and Examples - Biology Online Dictionary Main Navigation Search > Mutation Mutation Mutation n., plural: mutations [mjuˈteɪʃən] Definition: change in the nucleotide sequence, which the system is not able to repair and revert Table of Contents A mutation is a permanent, heritable change in the nucleotide sequence or the process by which such a change occurs in a gene or in a chromosome. There are two major types of mutations: small-scale and large-scale. Small-scale mutations are genetic mutations, often in the form of substitutions, deletions, and insertions of one or more nucleotides. Mutations occurring in certain areas of chromosomes are large-scale mutations. This form of mutation can be lethal or result in serious conditions or . Mutation Definition Mutation in general means a change or the process of changing, such as in nature, form, or quality. In biology, mutation refers to any change in the nucleotide sequence as a result of a failure of the system to revert the change. Thus, the altered sequence is permanent and heritable. Etymology: The term mutation came from Latin mutationem, mūtō, meaning “I move” or “I change”. Watch this vid about mutations: Types of Mutations are those involving one or a few nucleotides. In this chart, point mutation is a type of mutation involving a single nucleotide. It may be silent, nonsense, or missense type, depending on the resulting after . A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a gene or a chromosome. Based on the effect of mutation on the gene structure, mutations are (1) small-scale or (2) large-scale. are a type of mutation where one or a few nucleotides of a are affected. A large-scale mutation is a chromosomal mutation, e.g. deletion, inversion, or amplification of a region of a chromosome. A. Small-scale affect one or a few nucleotides of a . These are further classified into substitution mutation, insertion mutation, and deletion mutation. Substitution mutation is when a nucleotide is substituted with a different nucleotide. Examples of (base-pair) substitutions are as follows: A is substituted with a different purine (A → G) A replaced by a different pyrimidine (C → T) A purine is substituted with a pyrimidine A pyrimidine is replaced by a purine The first two examples are the types of (mutation). The last two are examples of . Substitution mutation is sometimes referred to as point mutation, i.e. when the gene mutation involves only one nucleotide. Point mutations may further be classified based on the impact on the resulting protein: Frameshift mutation Nonsense mutation Missense mutation Neutral mutations Silent mutation A frameshift is a type of gene mutation wherein the addition or deletion of (a number of) nucleotide(s) causes a shift in the reading frame of the in the . This leads to the alteration in the sequence of amino acids during protein translation. A nonsense mutation is a form of mutation producing a nonsense codon. A nonsense codon, as the name implies, does not code for amino acid and it leads to a protein product that is early truncated. A missense mutation results in a codon that specifies a different amino acid, and thus, causes the synthesis of a protein with an altered amino acid sequence during translation. A neutral mutation has no selective advantage or disadvantage. A silent mutation is when the codon codes for the same amino acid and therefore produces neither structural nor physiological change in the protein product. B. Large-scale are those involving region(s) of , e.g. chromosomal deletions, insertions, and inversions. Large-scale mutations involve a change in the chromosome. They are classified further into amplifications (also referred to as gene duplications), deletions of large chromosomal regions, and chromosomal inversions. Causes of Mutations Mutations may arise from faulty , insertions, or exchanges of in the . These, in turn, may be caused by exposure to , such as ultraviolet or ionizing radiation, certain chemicals, and . When a point mutation occurs in the DNA sequence, for instance, the error is corrected or repaired by direct reversal or by the replacement of damaged nitrogenous bases. When these mechanisms fail to restore the integrity of the sequence, the result is a mutation that is permanent and heritable. The error is propagated by DNA replication, i.e. a biological process of copying a strand of DNA. “Emergency! DNA Damage!“ A recent study on the DNA repair mechanism of the cell suggests likened the process to a team of paramedics — myosins — that bring the damaged DNA to an emergency room –the nuclear pore. (Recall that the nucleus has a nuclear membrane that has pores) Accordingly, broken DNA strands initiate a series of threads — nuclear actin filaments — to assemble and form a “road” that links to the edge of the nucleus. The myosin (i.e. a protein conveyed to be “walking” because of the presence of “two legs”) takes this path as it carries the injured DNA strand towards the nuclear pore for DNA repair. Read more here: An illustration depicting myosins as paramedics that carry damaged DNA along nuclear actin filaments that serve as a transient road towards the nuclear pore. (Illustrator: ©biologyonline.com) Effects of Mutations Mutation results in the formation or creation of a new character or . This new trait may be advantageous or deleterious. Evolutionary speaking, mutations are vital as they introduce new traits in a population, change allele frequencies, and include changes in the DNA sequences. The DNA in the carries the genetic code that specifies base pairs. This, in turn, specifies the sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide or protein during the translation of the mRNA transcript. are one of the major biomolecules that have multifarious functions. Some of them serve as structural components, others act as . When their structure is altered they may not be able to function as they should and this could lead to serious effects, like genetic disorders and syndromes. An organism, gene, or chromosome that is different from the wild type due to mutation(s) is referred to as a . Carrying the mutation, the organism could transmit the new trait across generations. Examples Examples of mutations in animals are those born with extra body parts, e.g. two-headed snakes, four-legged ducks, and a cyclops kitten. Often, these kinds of mutations lead to the death of the animal soon or a few days after its birth. In humans, genetic disorders are often due to a mutation involving an altered gene or chromosomal aberration. Sickle-cell disease, for instance, occurs when the 20th nucleotide of the gene for the beta chain of hemoglobin on chromosome 11 is changed from the codon GAG to GTG so that when translated the 6th amino acid is now a valine instead of glutamic acid. Other common mutation examples in humans are Angelman syndrome, Canavan disease, color blindness, cri-du-chat syndrome, cystic fibrosis, Down syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, haemochromatosis, haemophilia, Klinefelter syndrome, phenylketonuria, Prader–Willi syndrome, Tay–Sachs disease, and Turner syndrome. In plants, mutations are exemplified by those bearing chimera, sports, or breaks. They are naturally occurring and can cause changes in the appearance of the foliage, flowers, fruit, or stems of any plant. Take the Mutation Biology Quiz! Quiz Choose the best answer. 1.

A gene mutation (myoo-TAY-shun) is a change in one or more genes. Some mutations can lead to genetic disorders or illnesses. What Are Genes? Genes are short sections of DNA. They determine our traits, which are things like hair color, height, body type, and other things that make a person unique. Genes also play a role in a person's risk for some diseases and health conditions. Each of us has about 24,000 different types of genes. What Is DNA? DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid is the carrier of all our genes. Each person gets one copy of DNA from their mother and one copy from their father. DNA creates a code using four chemicals called nucleotides (NEW-klee-uh-tydes). This code determines which genes a person has. DNA is located inside the chromosomes. What Is a Chromosome? A chromosome (KRO-muh-sohm) is an X-shaped thread-like structure in the body's cells. It contains DNA. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes. What Causes a Gene Mutation? A gene can mutate because of: a change in one or more nucleotides of DNA a change in many genes loss of one or more genes rearrangement of genes or whole chromosomes Do Parents Pass Gene Mutations to Children? If a parent carries a gene mutation in their egg or sperm, it can pass to their child. These hereditary (or inherited) mutations are in almost every cell of the person's body throughout their life. Hereditary mutations include , , and . Other mutations can happen on their own during a person's life. These are called sporadic, spontaneous, or new mutations. They affect only some cells. Damage from the or exposure to some types of chemicals can lead to new mutations. These mutations are not passed from parents to their children. Do All Gene Mutations Cause Health Problems? Most gene mutations have no effect on health. And the body can repair many mutations. Some mutations are even helpful. For example, people can have a mutation that protects them from heart disease or gives them harder bones.

In cultivated crops like strawberries, farmers may help this process along by selectively growing plants with mutations that make the fruits more resilient against diPhotograph by Jim RichardsonArticleVocabularyA mutation is a change in the structure of a gene, the unit of heredity. Genes are made of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), a long molecule composed of building blocks called nucleotides. Each nucleotide is built around one of four different subunits called bases. These bases are known as guanine, cytosine, adenine, and thymine. A gene carries information in the sequence of its nucleotides, just as a sentence carries information in the sequence of its letters.One type of mutation is a change in a base. This is called a point mutation and it is like changing one letter in a word. Most genes carry instructions for making proteins. When a base is changed in a gene, different results are possible, depending on which base is changed and what it is changed into. The gene may produce an altered protein, it may produce no protein, or it may produce the usual protein. Most mutations are not harmful, but some can be. A harmful mutation can result in a genetic disorder or even cancer.Another kind of mutation is a chromosomal mutation. Chromosomes, located in the cell nucleus, are tiny threadlike structures that carry genes. A chromosome consists of a molecule of DNA together with proteins. Sometimes, a long segment of DNA is inserted into a chromosome, deleted from a chromosome, flipped around within a chromosome, duplicated, or moved from one chromosome to another. Such changes are usually very harmful.One example of a chromosomal mutation is a condition called Down syndrome. In each cell, humans normally have forty-six chromosomes, consisting of two copies of the twenty-three kinds of chromosomes. Down syndrome usually results from the presence of one extra copy of a particular chromosome, or an extra portion of that chromosome. The presence of that extra chromosome leads to problems with certain organs of the body, such as the heart. It can also lead to leukemia—a cancer of the blood-forming cells—and produce mental disabilities. Many people with Down syndrome also have distinct facial features.Mutations can be inherited or acquired during a person's lifetime. Mutations that an individual inherits from their parents are called hereditary mutations. They are present in all body cells and can be passed down to new generations. Acquired mutations occur during an individual’s life. If an acquired mutation occurs in an egg or sperm cell, it can be passed down to the individual’s offspring. Once an acquired mutation is passed down, it is a hereditary mutation. Acquired mutations are not passed down if they occur in the somatic cells, meaning body cells other than sperm cells and egg cells. Some acquired mutations occur spontaneously and randomly in genes. Other mutations are caused by environmental factors, such as exposure to certain chemicals or radiation.Mutations occur throughout the natural world. Some mutations are beneficial and increase the possibility that an organism will thrive and pass on its genes to the next generation. When mutations improve survival or reproduction, the process of natural selection will cause the mutation to become more common over time. When mutations are harmful, they become less common over time.

The DNA sequence codes for proteins, the building blocks of life, detirmining everything from your eye colour and height to your risk of certain diseases. A DNA molecule looks like a twisted ladder and is known as the '. It consists of two double-sided strands of alternating sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups wrapped around each other. Collectively, this is known as a nucleotide. These two strands are connected by four chemical base pairs, including: adenine cytosine guanine thymine These bases always pair together in the same way: A with T, and C with G. What's more, the order of these letters influences the content of the instructions, similiarly to how the letters of the alphabet form different words. For example, ATCGTT might instruct for blue eyes, while ATCGCT might instruct for brown. In humans, most DNA is tightly encased in a nucleus cell, known as a chromosome. This is called nuclear DNA. As well as nuclear DNA, humans also have a small amount of mitochondrial DNA, which powers the cell. Mitochondrial DNA only comes from the maternal line. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, or 46 in total, with 2 of these being sex chromosomes. Some individuals have an extra chromosome , such as Down's syndrome. A 3D animation showing how DNA code becomes a functional protein A code that cannot be read is useless, so how does the information stored in DNA become a functional protein? Known as the ""central dogma"" of molecular biology, the process goes as follows: DNA molecules replicate themselves and produce new DNA. This DNA then makes , which in turn, create proteins (translation). The reality is a little more complicated, but broadly speaking, this explains the process accurately. Amazingly, humans share around 60% of their DNA with both bananas and fruit flies! In fact, fruit flies are one of the most studied insects because they share of the genes that cause diseases in humans. ☝Fun Fact?☝ Did you know: If all the DNA from a single human cell was stretched out end-to-end, it would make a six-foot-long strand! What is a gene? As we have touched upon, DNA sequences contain instructions on how to build proteins and other molecules. These sequences are known as genes. is actually made up of protein-encoding genes; the remaining DNA is known as non-coding DNA which regulates transciption and translation. Genes can range from a few hundred base pairs to as many as 1 million, all of which contain blueprints for unique traits. We receive 50% of our mother's genes and 50% of our father's genes, making us similar but not identical to both. Humans share many of the same genes with each other; in fact, we are over 99% similar! It might not sound like much, but this small difference accounts for the vast variations we witness in both health and appearance. Humans possess a pair of each chromosome, ranking 46 collectively, meaning they have two versions of each gene. These versions are called alleles and can be either dominant or recessive. Dominant alleles manifest themselves even if there is only one copy of them. For example, a dominant brown eye gene will result in brown eyes, even if you have a recessive blue eye gene as well. On the contrary, recessive genes require both alleles to be the same for the characteristic to be expressed; you would need two recessive blue eye genes for this to influence your phentotype. Pheno what? In short, a phenotype is simply an individual's observable traits. ☝Fun Fact?☝ Humans have around 20,000 genes, whereas a humble grain of rice has around 40,000. Collectively, your gut microbiome has over 20 million genes! What are genetic mutations? Genetic mutations are random changes in the DNA sequence that can be caused by environmental factors or inherited at birth. Those acquired during your life by factors such as UV light, X-rays, cigarette smoke and copying mistakes during cell division are called somatic mutations. These cannot be passed onto offspring as they occur after conception and in cells other than the sperm or egg. A short explanantion of what genetic mutations are The most common somatic mutations are single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP'S), meaning a single letter is changed in the DNA code. These occur around once in every 300 bases. When copying errors occur during cell division, our DNA repairs the majority of them before the gene is expressed. With that being said, sometimes mutations can go unnoticed, leading to permanent mutations. When letters in our DNA code are changed, it alters the instructions in that genetic code, for better or worse. Genetic mutations mostly have no effect at all; however, small changes can adversely impact health. For example, just one letter deleted or changed can result in a damaged protein, extra protein, or no protein at all, all of which have serious consequences. Genetic mutations which are inherited at birth are known as germline mutations; an example is sickle cell anaemia. Germline refers to mutations that occur in the sperm and egg. This genetic information is the source of all DNA for every cell in the body. Type of mutation Effect on DNA sequence Deletion A letter is deleted from the DNA sequence. Inversion A sequence of a chromosome is reversed end-to-end, for example, T, G, C become C,G,T. Substitution A sequence of letters are replaced by the same amount of letters. Duplication When letters are duplicated in the sequence, for example, T,G,C becomes T,T,G,C. The good, the bad and the benign The DNA Double Helix Genetic mutations can be beneficial, harmful or neutral; for example, some mutations can predispose an individual to cancer or Alzheimer's disease, whilst others confer lactose tolerance and HIV resistance. Some individuals even have a gene that , making them naturally strong runners. Mutations account for genetic variation among species. By extension, they enable evolution via natural selection, a process in which organisms that develop beneficial traits survive and prosper, whilst those with less helpful traits are selected against. For example, a frog might develop a mutation that gives them a green skin pigment, allowing them to camouflage from predators. This helpful adaptation, though entirely random, will allow more green frogs to survive and pass on their DNA to successive generations. The most famous emblem of this process is Charles Darwin's Galapagos finches. In short, Darwin observed that fruit-eating finches had parrot-like beaks whilst insect-eating one's had narrow, elongated beaks. These features perfectly suited their diet and habitats. As we now know, animals experience random mutations, some of which can aid survival. Over time, those who have beneficial mutations thrive and pass on these genetic variants. ☝Fun Fact?☝ The Finnish Skier, , was suspected of doping because his red blood cell count was so high. It turned out that this was a result of a mutated gene that ran in his family and was likely a factor behind his freakish endurance. He won seven Olympic medals in his lifetime. Genetic"

What is a mutation? Over a lifetime our can undergo changes or ‘’ in the sequence of , A, C, G and T. This results in changes in the that are made. This can be a bad or a good thing. Mutations can occur during if errors are made and not corrected in time. Mutations can also occur as the result of exposure to environmental factors such as smoking, sunlight and radiation. Often cells can recognise any potentially mutation-causing damage and repair it before it becomes a fixed mutation. Mutations contribute to within . Mutations can also be inherited, particularly if they have a positive effect. For example, the disorder is caused by a mutation in the that instructs the building of a protein called . This causes the to become an abnormal, rigid, sickle shape. However, in African populations, having this mutation also protects against . However, mutation can also disrupt normal gene activity and cause diseases, like is the most common human genetic disease; it is caused by mutations occurring in a number of growth-controlling genes. Sometimes faulty, cancer-causing genes can exist from birth, increasing a person’s chance of getting cancer. An illustration to show an example of a DNA mutation.

Berbagai arti dari mutasi dapat diperiksa pada . Bagian dari Komponen penting Sejarah dan topik () Penelitan ( ) Pengobatan personal Mutasi adalah perubahan yang terjadi pada bahan genetik baik pada taraf tingkatan gen maupun pada tingkat kromosom. Mutasi pada tingkat gen disebut mutasi titik, sedangkan mutasi pada kromosomal biasanya disebut aberasi. Mutasi pada gen dapat mengarah pada munculnya alel baru dan menjadi dasar munculnya variasi-variasi baru pada spesies. Mutasi terjadi pada frekuensi rendah di alam, biasanya lebih rendah daripada 1:10.000 individu. Mutasi di alam dapat terjadi akibat zat pembangkit mutasi (mutagen, termasuk karsinogen), radiasi surya, radioaktif, sinar ultraviolet, sinar X, serta loncatan energi listrik seperti petir. Individu yang memperlihatkan perubahan sifat (fenotipe) akibat mutasi disebut mutan. Dalam kajian genetik, mutan biasa dibandingkan dengan individu yang tidak mengalami perubahan sifat (individu tipe liar atau ""wild type""). Jenis mutasi[ | ] Mutasi titik[ | ] Mutasi titik merupakan perubahan pada dari atau . Mutasi titik relatif sering terjadi namun efeknya dapat dikurangi oleh . Mutasi titik dapat berakibat berubahnya urutan asam amino pada protein, dan dapat mengakibatkan berkurangnya, berubahnya atau hilangnya fungsi . Teknologi saat ini menggunakan mutasi titik sebagai (disebut ) untuk mengkaji perubahan yang terjadi pada gen dan dikaitkan dengan perubahan yang terjadi. Contoh mutasi gen adalah reaksi asam nitrit dengan adenin menjadi zat hipoxanthine. Zat ini akan menempati tempat adenin asli dan berpasangan dengan sitosin, bukan lagi dengan timin. Aberasi[ | ] Mutasi kromosom, sering juga disebut dengan mutasi besar atau kromosom adalah perubahan jumlah kromosom dan susunan atau urutan gen dalam kromosom. Mutasi kromosom sering terjadi karena kesalahan dan sedikit dalam . Euploidi[ | ] Euploidi adalah perubahan jumlah n. Dalam hal ini, ""n"" menandakan jumlah set kromosom. Sebagai contoh, sel tubuh manusia memiliki 2 paket kromosom sehingga disebut 2n, dimana satu paket n manusia berjumlah 23 kromosom. Euploidi dibagi menjadi dua yaitu autopoliploidi dan allopoliploidi. Pada autopoliploidi, n-nya mengganda sendiri karena kesalahan meiosis, sedangkan allopoliploidi, yaitu perkawinan atau hibrid antara spesies yang berbeda jumlah set kromosomnya. Aneusomi[ | ] Aneusomi adalah perubahan jumlah kromosom. Penyebabnya adalah anafase lag (peristiwa tidak melekatnya benang-benang spindel ke sentromer) dan non disjunction (gagal berpisah). Aneusomi pada manusia dapat menyebabkan: Sindrom Turner, dengan kariotipe (22AA+X0). Jumlah kromosomnya 45 dan kehilangan 1 kromosom kelamin. Penderita Sindrom Turner berjenis kelamin wanita, tetapi ovumnya tidak berkembang (ovaricular disgenesis). Sindrom Klinefelter, kariotipe (22 AA+XXY), mengalami trisomik pada kromosom gonosom. Penderita Sindrom Klinefelter berjenis kelamin laki-laki, tetapi testisnya tidak berkembang (testicular disgenesis) sehingga tidak bisa menghasilkan sperma (aspermia) dan mandul (gynaecomastis) serta payudaranya tumbuh. Sindrom Jacobs, kariotipe (22AA+XYY), trisomik pada kromosom gonosom. Penderita sindrom ini umumnya berwajah kriminal, suka menusuk-nusuk mata dengan benda tajam, seperti pensil,dll dan juga sering berbuat kriminal. Penelitian di luar negeri mengatakan bahwa sebagian besar orang-orang yang masuk penjara adalah orang-orang yang menderita Sindrom Jacobs. Sindrom Patau, kariotipe (45A+XX/XY), trisomik pada kromosom autosom. kromosom autosomnya mengalami kelainan pada kromosom nomor 13, 14, atau 15. Sindrom Edward, kariotipe (45A+XX/XY), trisomik pada autosom. Autosom mengalami kelainan pada kromosom nomor 16,17, atau 18. Penderita sindrom ini mempunyai tengkorak lonjong, bahu lebar pendek, telinga agak ke bawah dan tidak wajar. Delesi, duplikasi, inversi[ | ] Terjadi ketika sebuah fragmen kromosom patah dan hilang pada saat Kromosom tempat fragmen tersebut berasal kemudian akan kehilangan -gen tertentu. Namun dalam beberapa kasus, fragmen patahan tersebut dapat berikatan dengan kromosom menghasilkan . Fragmen tersebut juga dapat melekat kembali pada kromosom asalnya dengan arah terbalik dan menghasilkan inversi. Mutagen[ | ] Bahan-bahan yang menyebabkan terjadinya mutasi disebut mutagen. Mutagen dibagi menjadi tiga yaitu: Mutagen bahan kimia, contohnya adalah kolkisin dan zat digitonin. adalah zat yang dapat menghalangi terbentuknya benang-benang spindel pada proses anafase dan dapat menghambat pembelahan sel pada anafase. Mutagen bahan fisika, contohnya sinar , sinar radioaktif, dan sinar gamma. Sinar ultraviolet dapat menyebabkan kanker kulit. Mutagen bahan biologi, diduga virus dan bakteri dapat menyebabkan terjadinya mutasi. Bagian virus yang dapat menyebabkan terjadinya mutasi adalah DNA-nya. Pemanfaatan mutasi[ | ] Pada umumnya, mutasi itu merugikan, mutannya bersifat letal dan resesif. Namun mutasi juga menguntungkan, diantaranya, melalui mutasi, dapat dibuat tumbuhan yang sifatnya unggul. Contohnya, semangka tanpa biji, jeruk tanpa biji, buah stroberi yang besar, dan lain-lain. Mutasi ini juga menjadi salah satu kunci terjadinya evolusi di dunia ini. Terbentuknya tumbuhan poliploid ini menguntungkan bagi manusia, tetapi merugikan bagi tumbuhan yang mengalami mutasi, karena tumbuhan tersebut menjadi tidak bisa berkembang biak secara generatif. Meskipun secara biologi sebagian terbesar mutasi menyebabkan gangguan pada (fitness) individu, bahkan kematian, mutasi sebenarnya adalah salah satu kunci bagi kemampuan beradaptasi suatu jenis (spesies) terhadap lingkungan baru atau yang berubah. Sisi positif ini dimanfaatkan oleh sejumlah bidang biologi terapan. Terapi sel-sel tumor[ | ] Aplikasi radiasi (seperti penyinaran dengan ) dan untuk menghambat perkembangan sel-sel dan pada dasarnya adalah menginduksi mutasi pada sel-sel kanker sebagai targetnya. Agen mutasi tersebut akan menyebabkan sel-sel target berhenti tumbuh karena tidak mampu lagi memperbanyak diri. Pemuliaan[ | ] Pemaparan terhadap radiasi sinar mengion, seperti dari -60, atau terhadap beberapa , seperti dan , dalam waktu dan kadar tertentu juga digunakan untuk menginduksi mutasi. Dalam penerapan ini, mutasi tidak ditujukan untuk mematikan sel, tetapi untuk mengubah susunan pada atau untuk menyebabkan mutasi segmental. Harapannya adalah ada beberapa sel yang akan mengalami mutasi yang menguntungkan. Dengan demikian, tidak hanya sedikit yang dipaparkan, tetapi ribuan sampai ratusan ribu individu. Cara pemuliaan dengan bantuan mutasi ini kebanyakan dilakukan terhadap tanaman , seperti tanaman dan (ornamental). telah menghasilkan beberapa unggul yang dirakit melalui mutasi.

0,cancer,DNA Mutation and Repair,https://www.cancer.net/navigating-cancer-care/cancer-basics/genetics/genes-and-cancer,"Genes and Cancer | Cancer.Net You are here > > > > Genes and Cancer Genes and Cancer Approved by the , 11/2022 Your DNA is the material in your cells that is the building blocks for your genes. Genes are the instructions that tell each cell how to grow, develop, and work. Some things your genes control are: How fast each cell grows How often it divides to make new cells How long it lives The genes in each cell are arranged in structures called chromosomes. What are chromosomes? Your chromosomes are the structures your genes are organized on. You can think of genes like pages in a book. The chromosome is the book the pages are in. Each person typically has 46 chromosomes total. They are in groups of 2, so you have 23 pairs of chromosomes. One chromosome in each pair comes from your mother, and the other comes from your father. One pair of the body's chromosomes are the sex chromosomes. The male pair has an X and a Y chromosome. In the female pair, the 2 chromosomes are both typically X. The other 22 pairs of chromosomes are called autosomes. They determine other characteristics, such as hair color, height, and more. How do our genes work? Genes tell your cells what to do. They do this by making substances called proteins. Each protein has a specific job to do in your body. To make its protein correctly, each gene needs the right information. If it has this, it can make proteins that work the way they are supposed to. Cancer starts when one or more genes in a cell change, or mutate. Different names for this include gene mutations or pathogenic variants. When this happens, the protein it makes is abnormal. Or it may not be made at all. Your body receives either no information or abnormal information. This can make cells multiply out of control and cause cancer. Types of gene mutations or pathogenic variants There are 2 basic types of gene mutations or pathogenic variants. Acquired mutations. These variants, or mutations, happen on their own. ""Acquired"" means you get them during your lifetime. You are not born with them or inherit them. These mutations are the most common cause of cancer. They happen when the genes in a specific cell are damaged. For example, breast cancer or colon cancer may develop if the genes in a breast or colon cell are damaged. The genes give cells the signal to divide many times without stopping as they normally would. This causes a tumor to start. Cancer from this type of mutation is called ""sporadic"" cancer. The mutation simply starts in one cell somewhere in your body. It is not found in every cell in the body, and it is not passed from parent to child. Common factors causing sporadic mutations include the following: Tobacco use Ultraviolet (UV) radiation Viruses Aging Germline mutations. These are pathogenic variants, or mutations, that come from your parents. The mutation is in one of your mother's egg cells and/or one of your father's sperm cells. When the egg and sperm meet and form an embryo, the embryo will have the mutation. As the embryo grows into a baby, the mutation from the original sperm or egg cell is copied into the new body's cells. This includes the sperm or egg cells. So the person can pass the mutation on to their children. Cancer caused by germline mutations is called inherited cancer. About 5 to 20 in every 100 cancers starts from a mutation passed on by a parent. Do mutations always cause cancer? Not necessarily. Mutations happen often, and they can be good, bad, or neutral. It depends on where in the gene the change happens. Your body usually fixes most mutations so they do not affect you. Having just one mutation probably will not cause cancer. Cancer is more likely when mutations build up over many years. That is why older people have cancer more often than young people do. They have lived longer, so their cells have had more time for mutations to build up. Are there specific ""cancer genes?"" Some gene variants, or mutations, are linked with cancer. These include mutations in the specific types of genes below. Tumor suppressor genes. Genes that protect against cancer are called tumor suppressor genes. They normally limit how much a cell can grow. They do this by: Controlling how fast cells divide to make new cells Fixing mistakes in DNA Controlling when a cell dies Variants in a tumor suppressor gene can allow cells to grow out of control. These cells can eventually form a tumor. Some tumor suppressor genes are BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 or TP53. If a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes is passed down from your parents, you have a greater risk of , pancreatic, and prostate cancer. Mutations in these genes also raise the risk of melanoma. The most common tumor suppressor gene that mutates in people with cancer is p53 or TP53. This gene is missing or damaged in more than half of all cancers. Inherited p53 mutations are rare. If you have one, you have a greater risk of many different types of cancer. Oncogenes. Mutations in certain genes can turn a healthy cell into a cancer cell. These mutations are not known to be inherited. Two common oncogenes are: HER2. This gene makes a protein that controls cancer growth. It is found in some cancer cells, such as some breast and ovarian cancer cells. If a breast cancer is ""HER2 negative,"" it means the HER2 gene is not making this needed protein. The RAS family of genes. These genes make proteins that help cells communicate with each other, grow normally, and die when they are supposed to. Mutations in these genes can turn healthy cells into cancer cells. DNA repair genes. DNA repair genes fix mistakes that happen when your DNA is copied. DNA copying happens when cells divide normally to make new cells. Many DNA repair genes work like tumor suppressor genes do. They limit how much the cell can grow. BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 are all DNA repair genes. If one of your DNA repair genes has a mutation, mistakes in DNA do not get corrected. This means mutations can develop, and eventually lead to cancer. This is especially true if the mutation is in a tumor suppressor gene or an oncogene. You can inherit a mutation in a DNA repair gene, or it can happen on its own over your lifetime. is caused by an inherited DNA repair mutation. Mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, and p53 are inherited too. Learn more about . What is known about genes and cancer? Researchers have learned a lot about how genes are involved in cancer. But many cancers are not linked with any specific gene. When cancer develops, several gene mutations are probably involved, not just one. Also, gene mutations are not the only cause of cancer. Your everyday environment can also affect how genes and gene mutations work. Together, your genes and your environment can determine if you develop cancer. Researchers continue to study genes and cancer. What they have learned so far has helped improve cancer care. It has given doctors new ways to find cancer early, lower your risk, treat cancer with new treatments such as , and live longer. More studies about genes and cancer may help researchers learn how to do the following in the future: Predict a person's individual risk of cancer Find cancer more easily when it is smaller Treat different types of cancer better Questions to ask the health care team Is my cancer caused by a genetic mutation? Did one of my parents pass on the genetic mutation that caused my cancer? Is my cancer part of an inherited syndrome? Could I pass a genetic mutation that causes cancer to my children? Was there anything in my environment that could have caused my cancer? Does knowing about my genes help us choose the best cancer treatment? Should other people in my family have ?

The greater the dose of radiation a cell gets, the greater the chance of a mutation.Mutations could cause different genes to be switched on or off, and this could create a different or faulty protein to be synthesised.For example, if the protein is an important enzyme, the specific substrate might not fit into the substrate binding site. If it is a structural protein such as collagen, it might lose its strength.However, most DNA mutations do not alter a protein, they only alter it slightly so its appearance or function is not changed.There are many different types of mutations which can arise in DNA.previousnextpreviousnextOriginal gene structureThis shows the normal order of the bases for one of the strands.

0,www2.csudh,DNA Mutation and Repair,http://www2.csudh.edu/nsturm/CHEMXL153/DNAMutationRepair.htm,"DNA Mutation and Repair DNA Mutation and Repair A mutation, which may arise during replication and/or recombination, is a permanent change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA. Damaged DNA can be mutated either by substitution, deletion or insertion of base pairs. Mutations, for the most part, are harmless except when they lead to cell death or tumor formation. Because of the lethal potential of DNA mutations cells have evolved mechanisms for repairing damaged DNA. Types of Mutations There are three types of DNA Mutations: base substitutions, deletions and insertions. 1. Base Substitutions Single base substitutions are called point mutations, recall the point mutation Glu -----> Val which causes sickle-cell disease. Point mutations are the most common type of mutation and there are two types. Transition: this occurs when a purine is substituted with another purine or when a pyrimidine is substituted with another pyrimidine. Transversion: when a purine is substituted for a pyrimidine or a pyrimidine replaces a purine. Point mutations that occur in DNA sequences encoding proteins are either silent, missense or nonsense. Silent: If abase substitution occurs in the third position of the codon there is a good chance that a synonymous codon will be generated. Thus the amino acid sequence encoded by the gene is not changed and the mutation is said to be silent. Missence: When base substitution results in the generation of a codon that specifies a different amino acid and hence leads to a different polypeptide sequence. Depending on the type of amino acid substitution the missense mutation is either conservative or nonconservative. For example if the structure and properties of the substituted amino acid are very similar to the original amino acid the mutation is said to be conservative and will most likely have little effect on the resultant proteins structure / function. If the substitution leads to an amino acid with very different structure and properties the mutation is nonconservative and will probably be deleterious (bad) for the resultant proteins structure / function (i.e. the sickle cell point mutation). Nonsense: When a base substitution results in a stop codon ultimately truncating translation and most likely leading to a nonfunctional protein. 2. Deletions A deletion, resulting in a frameshift, results when one or more base pairs are lost from the DNA (see Figure above). If one or two bases are deleted the translational frame is altered resulting in a garbled message and nonfunctional product. A deletion of three or more bases leave the reading frame intact. A deletion of one or more codons results in a protein missing one or more amino acids. This may be deleterious or not. 3. Insertions The insertion of additional base pairs may lead to frameshifts depending on whether or not multiples of three base pairs are inserted. Combinations of insertions and deletions leading to a variety of outcomes are also possible. Causes of Mutations Errors in DNA Replication On very, very rare occasions DNA polymerase will incorporate a noncomplementary base into the daughter strand. During the next round of replication the missincorporated base would lead to a mutation. This, however, is very rare as the exonuclease functions as a proofreading mechanism recognizing mismatched base pairs and excising them. Errors in DNA Recombination DNA often rearranges itself by a process called recombination which proceeds via a variety of mechanisms. Occasionally DNA is lost during replication leading to a mutation. Chemical Damage to DNA Many chemical mutagens, some exogenous, some man-made, some environmental, are capable of damaging DNA. Many chemotherapeutic drugs and intercalating agent drugs function by damaging DNA. Radiation Gamma rays, X-rays, even UV light can interact with compounds in the cell generating free radicals which cause chemical damage to DNA. DNA Repair Damaged DNA can be repaired by several different mechanisms. Mismatch Repair Sometimes DNA polymerase incorporates an incorrect nucleotide during strand synthesis and the 3' to 5' editing system, exonuclease, fails to correct it. These mismatches as well as single base insertions and deletions are repaired by the mismatch repair mechanism. Mismatch repair relies on a secondary signal within the DNA to distinguish between the parental strand and daughter strand, which contains the replication error. Human cells posses a mismatch repair system similar to that of E. coli, which is described here. Methylation of the sequence GATC occurs on both strands sometime after DNA replication. Because DNA replication is semi-conservative, the new daughter strand remains unmethylated for a very short period of time following replication. This difference allows the mismatch repair system to determine which strand contains the error. A protein, MutS recognizes and binds the mismatched base pair. Another protein, MutL then binds to MutS and the partially methylated GATC sequence is recognized and bound by the endonuclease, MutH. The MutL/MutS complex then links with MutH which cuts the unmethylated DNA strand at the GATC site. A DNA Helicase, MutU unwinds the DNA strand in the direction of the mismatch and an exonuclease degrades the strand. DNA polymerase then fills in the gap and ligase seals the nick. Defects in the mismatch repair genes found in humans appear to be associated with the development of hereditary colorectal cancer. Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) NER in human cells begins with the formation of a complex of proteins XPA, XPF, ERCC1, HSSB at the lesion on the DNA. The transcription factor TFIIH, which contains several proteins, then binds to the complex in an ATP dependent reaction and makes an incision. The resulting 29 nucleotide segment of damaged DNA is then unwound, the gap is filled (DNA polymerase) and the nick sealed (ligase). Direct Repair of Damaged DNA Sometimes damage to a base can be directly repaired by specialized enzymes without having to excise the nucleotide. Recombination Repair This mechanism enables a cell to replicate past the damage and fix it later. Regulation of Damage Control DNA repair is regulated in mammalian cells by a sensing mechanism that detects DNA damage and activates a protein called p53. p53 is a transcriptional regulatory factor that controls the expression of some gene products that affect cell cycling, DNA replication and DNA repair. Some of the functions of p53, which are just being determined, are: stimulation of the expression of genes encoding p21 and Gaad45. Loss of p53 function can be deleterious, about 50% of all human cancers have a mutated p53 gene. The p21 protein binds and inactivates a cell division kinase (CDK) which results in cell cycle arrest. p21 also binds and inactivates PCNA resulting in the inactivation of replication forks. The PCNA/Gaad45 complex participates in excision repair of damaged DNA. Some examples of the diseases resulting from defects in DNA repair mechanisms.

Of course not, but mutations can sometimes result in drastic changes in living things. Figure \(\PageIndex{1}\): Superhero What Are Mutations? Mutations are random changes in the sequence of bases in DNA. The word mutation may make you think of Ninja Turtles, but that's a misrepresentation of how most mutations work. First of all, everyone has mutations. In fact, most people have dozens or even hundreds of mutations in their DNA. Secondly, from an evolutionary perspective, mutations are essential. They are needed for evolution to occur because they are the ultimate source of all new genetic variation in any species. Causes of Mutations Is it possible for mutations to occur spontaneously, or does there have to be a cause of the mutation? Well, the answer is that both are possible. Mutagenesis is a process by which the genetic information of an organism is changed in a stable manner, resulting in a mutation. In nature, mutagenesis can lead to changes that are beneficial or harmful or have no effect. Harmful mutations can lead to cancer and various heritable diseases, but beneficial mutations are the driving force of evolution. In 1927, Hermann Muller first demonstrated the effects of mutations with observable changes in chromosomes. He induced mutagenesis by irradiating fruit flies with X-rays, Mutagenesis may occur spontaneously or be induced. A spontaneous mutation can just happen. These mutations are not caused by an environmental factor but occur during normal cellular processes. A spontaneous mutation may be due to a mistake during DNA replication. Mutations may also occur during mitosis and meiosis. A mutation caused by an environmental factor, or mutagen, is known as an induced mutation. Typical mutagens include chemicals, like those inhaled while smoking, and radiation, such as X-rays, ultraviolet light, and nuclear radiation. Different mutagens have different modes of damaging DNA. For example, UV radiation may cause bonding between the adjacent nucleotides on one strand of DNA molecule (Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\)). This prohibits normal bonding between complementary nucleotides of the opposing strand. This causes a bulge in the DNA double helix. If this damage is not repaired, it leads to mutation. Thus, DNA does not replicate, transcribe, and translate properly. Figure \(\PageIndex{2}\): Ultraviolet (UV) photons harm the DNA molecules of living organisms in different ways. In one common damage event, adjacent bases bond with each other, instead of across the “ladder.” This makes a bulge, and the distorted DNA molecule does not function properly. Types of Mutations There are a variety of types of mutations. Two major categories of mutations are germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in gametes, the sex cells, such as eggs and sperm. These mutations are especially significant because they can be transmitted to offspring and every cell in the offspring will have the mutations. Somatic mutations occur in other cells of the body. These mutations may have little effect on the organism because they are confined to just one cell and its daughter cells. Somatic mutations also cannot be passed on to offspring. Mutations also differ in the way that the genetic material is changed. Mutations may change an entire chromosome or just one or a few nucleotides. Chromosomal Alterations Chromosomal alterations are mutations that change chromosome structure or number. They occur when a section of a chromosome breaks off and rejoins incorrectly or does not rejoin at all. Possible ways these mutations can occur are illustrated in Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\). Chromosomal alterations are very serious. They often result in the death of the organism in which they occur. If the organism survives, it may be affected in multiple ways. An example of a human chromosomal alteration is the mutation that causes Down Syndrome. It is a duplication mutation that leads to developmental delays and other abnormalities. It occurs when the individual inherits an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is also called trisomy (""three-chromosome"") 21. Figure \(\PageIndex{3}\): Chromosomal Alterations. The chromosomal alterations may occur due to deletion or duplication of genes in a chromosome, inversion of a section of a chromosome, insertion of genes from one chromosome to another, or exchanges of genes between two chromosomes. A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide in DNA. This type of mutation is usually less serious than a chromosomal alteration. An example of a point mutation is a mutation that changes the codon UUU to the codon UCU. Point mutations can be silent, missense, or nonsense mutations, as shown in Table \(\PageIndex{1}\). The effects of point mutations depend on how they change the genetic code. Table \(\PageIndex{1}\): Point Mutation Types Type Description Example Effect Silent mutated codon codes for the same amino acid CAA (glutamine) → CAG (glutamine) none Missense mutated codon codes for a different amino acid CAA (glutamine) → CCA (proline) variable Nonsense a mutated codon is a premature stop codon CAA (glutamine) → UAA (stop) usually serious Frameshift Mutations A frameshift mutation is a deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides that changes the reading frame of the base sequence. Deletions remove nucleotides, and insertions add nucleotides. Consider the following sequence of bases in RNA: AUG-AAU-ACG-GCU = methionine-asparagine-threonine-alanine Now assume that an insertion occurs in this sequence. Let’s say an A nucleotide is inserted after the start codon AUG. Then the sequence of bases becomes: AUG-AAA-UAC-GGC-U = methionine-lysine-tyrosine-glycine Even though the rest of the sequence is unchanged, this insertion changes the reading frame and thus all of the codons that follow it. As this example shows, a frameshift mutation can dramatically change how the codons in mRNA are read. This can have a drastic effect on the protein product. Another example of the frameshift mutation due to the deletion of a nucleotide is illustrated in Figure \(\PageIndex{4}\). In this example, a premature stop codon is created by the mutation. Figure \(\PageIndex{4}\): The image shows how the frame of the coding sequence of a gene changes when a nucleotide gets deleted due to mutation. Normal gene codes for a polypeptide met-lys-phe-gly-ile-val-pro. When a U from the third position of the third codon gets deleted, the polypeptide reduced to met-lys-leu-ala because the third and fourth codons code for different amino acids and the fifth codon converts to a stop codon. Effects of Mutations The majority of mutations have neither negative nor positive effects on the organism in which they occur. These mutations are called neutral mutations. Examples include silent point mutations, which are neutral because they do not change the amino acids in the proteins they encode. Many other DNA damages or errors have no effects on the organism because they are repaired before protein synthesis occurs. Cells have multiple repair mechanisms to fix errors in DNA. Beneficial Mutations Some mutations have a positive effect on the organism in which they occur. They are referred to as beneficial mutations. They generally code for new versions of proteins that help organisms adapt to their environment. If they increase an organism’s chances of surviving or reproducing, the mutations are likely to become more common over time. There are several well-known examples of beneficial mutations. Here are just two: Mutations have occurred in bacteria that allow the bacteria to survive in the presence of antibiotic drugs. The mutations have led to the evolution of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. A unique mutation is found in people in a small town in Italy. The mutation protects them from developing atherosclerosis, which is the dangerous buildup of fatty materials in blood vessels. The individual in which the mutation first appeared has even been identified. Harmful Mutations Imagine making a random change in a complicated machine such as a car engine. The chance that the random change would improve the functioning of the car is very small. The change is far more likely to result in a car that does not run well or perhaps does not run at all. By the same token, any random change in a gene's DNA is likely to result in the production of a protein that does not function normally or may not function at all. Such mutations are likely to be harmful. Harmful mutations may cause genetic disorders or cancer. A genetic disorder is a disease, syndrome, or other abnormal condition caused by a mutation in one or more genes or by a chromosomal alteration. An example of a genetic disorder is cystic fibrosis. A mutation in a single gene causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and blocks ducts in digestive organs. Cancer is a disease in which cells grow out of control and form abnormal masses of cells called tumors. It is generally caused by mutations in genes that regulate the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, cells with damaged DNA are allowed to divide without restrictions. Feature: My Human Body Inherited mutations are thought to play a role in about 5 to 10 percent of all cancers. Specific mutations that cause many of the known hereditary cancers have been identified. Most of the mutations occur in genes that control the growth of cells or the repair of damaged DNA. Genetic testing can be done to determine whether individuals have inherited specific cancer-causing mutations. Some of the most common inherited cancers for which genetic testing is available hereditary, breast, and ovarian cancer, caused by mutations in genes named BRCA1 and BRCA2. Besides breast and ovarian cancers, mutations in these genes may also cause pancreatic and prostate cancers. Genetic testing is generally done on a small sample of body fluid or tissue, such as blood, saliva, or skin cells. The sample is analyzed by a lab that specializes in genetic testing, and it usually takes at least a few weeks to get the test results. Should you get genetic testing to find out whether you have inherited a cancer-causing mutation? Such testing is not done routinely just to screen patients for risk of cancer. Instead, the tests are generally done only when the following three criteria are met: The test can determine definitively whether a specific gene is mutation is present. This is the case with the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, for example. The test results would be useful to help guide future medical care. For example, if you found out you had a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, you might get more frequent breast and ovarian cancer screenings than are generally recommended. You have a personal or family history that suggests you are at risk of inherited cancer. Criterion number 3 is based, in turn, on such factors as: diagnosis of cancer at an unusually young age. several different cancers occurring independently in the same individual. several close genetic relatives having the same type of cancer (such as a maternal grandmother, mother, and sister all having breast cancer). cancer occurring in both organs in a set of paired organs (such as both kidneys or both breasts). If you meet the criteria for genetic testing and are advised to undergo it, genetic counseling is highly recommended. A genetic counselor can help you understand what the results mean and how to make use of them to reduce your risk of developing cancer. For example, a positive test result that shows the presence of a mutation may not necessarily mean that you will develop cancer. It may depend on whether the gene is located on an autosome or sex chromosome and whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. Lifestyle factors may also play a role in cancer risk even for hereditary cancers, and early detection can often be life-saving if cancer does develop. Genetic counseling can also help you assess the chances that any children you may have will inherit the mutation. Review Define mutation. Identify the causes of mutation. Compare and contrast germline and somatic mutations. Describe chromosomal alterations, point mutations, and frameshift mutations. Identify the potential effects of each type of mutation. Why are many mutations neutral in their effects? Give an example of a beneficial mutation and an example of a harmful mutation.

What happens when there are changes to genes? To answer this question, we have to explore mutations. What are mutations? Mutations are changes in our genes that can lead to missing, incorrect, or extra information. Remember that your genes are like an instruction manual. If the manual is missing a page, or has added or incorrect information, things may not work properly. The same is true for your body. Sometimes mutations make it hard for your body to build proteins that allow it to function as it should. When this happens, genetic disease may occur. What causes mutations? At first, we might think of mutations as something that will make us sick, but that isn’t always the case. Mutations are a common and natural part of life. They happen for different reasons, and they can be inherited or noninherited. Inherited mutations: passed down Inherited mutations are passed down from one or both birth parents. They may also be passed to your own children. They can travel through several generations. Hemophilia is an example of an inherited mutation. Noninherited mutations: not passed down Noninherited mutations happen unexpectedly from things you come into contact with or from health choices. Certain cancers are caused by environmental factors and are noninherited mutations. Genetic diseases caused by mutations Genetic mutations cause anywhere from 5000 to 8000 genetic diseases. Many of these diseases result in serious health problems. Some diseases already have therapies that can help. The possibilities for treatments continue to grow as we learn more about these conditions.We can break genetic disorders down into 3 types: Single gene Single-gene disorders occur when there is a mutation in only 1 gene. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a single-gene disorder. Chromosomal A chromosomal disorder can happen when there is an extra or missing chromosome. It can also occur if there is a change to part of a chromosome. Down syndrome is an example of a chromosomal disorder. Complex Complex disorders happen when there is a change, or mutation, in more than 1 gene. Type 2 diabetes is an example of a complex disorder. Mutations within the genes can lead to genetic disease.

0,en.wikipedia,Pythagorean theorem - Encyclopedia of Mathematics,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem,"Pythagorean relation: the squared distance between two points equals the sum of squares of the difference in each coordinate between the points. The theorem can be in various ways: to , to , to objects that are not right triangles, and to objects that are not triangles at all but solids. The Pythagorean theorem has attracted interest outside mathematics as a symbol of mathematical , , or intellectual power; popular references in literature, plays, musicals, songs, stamps, and cartoons abound.[] Proofs using constructed squares Rearrangement proof of the Pythagorean theorem.(The area of the white space remains constant throughout the translation rearrangement of the triangles. At all moments in time, the area is always c². And likewise, at all moments in time, the area is always a²+b².) Rearrangement proofs In one rearrangement proof, two squares are used whose sides have a measure of a + b {\displaystyle a+b} and which contain four right triangles whose sides are a, b and c, with the hypotenuse being c. In the square on the right side, the triangles are placed such that the corners of the square correspond to the corners of the right angle in the triangles, forming a square in the center whose sides are length c. Each outer square has an area of ( a + b ) 2 {\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}} as well as 2 a b + c 2 {\displaystyle 2ab+c^{2}} , with 2 a b {\displaystyle 2ab} representing the total area of the four triangles. Within the big square on the left side, the four triangles are moved to form two similar rectangles with sides of length a and b. These rectangles in their new position have now delineated two new squares, one having side length a is formed in the bottom-left corner, and another square of side length b formed in the top-right corner. In this new position, this left side now has a square of area ( a + b ) 2 {\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}} as well as 2 a b + a 2 + b 2 {\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}} Since both squares have the area of ( a + b ) 2 {\displaystyle (a+b)^{2}} it follows that the other measure of the square area also equal each other such that 2 a b + c 2 {\displaystyle 2ab+c^{2}} = 2 a b + a 2 + b 2 {\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}} . With the area of the four triangles removed from both side of the equation what remains is a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}.} In another proof rectangles in the second box can also be placed such that both have one corner that correspond to consecutive corners of the square. In this way they also form two boxes, this time in consecutive corners, with areas a 2 {\displaystyle a^{2}} and b 2 {\displaystyle b^{2}} which will again lead to a second square of with the area 2 a b + a 2 + b 2 {\displaystyle 2ab+a^{2}+b^{2}} . English mathematician gives this proof in his commentary on Proposition I.47 in , and mentions the proposals of German mathematicians and that Pythagoras may have known this proof. Heath himself favors a different proposal for a Pythagorean proof, but acknowledges from the outset of his discussion ""that the Greek literature which we possess belonging to the first five centuries after Pythagoras contains no statement specifying this or any other particular great geometric discovery to him."" Recent scholarship has cast increasing doubt on any sort of role for Pythagoras as a creator of mathematics, although debate about this continues. Algebraic proofs Diagram of the two algebraic proofs The theorem can be proved algebraically using four copies of the same triangle arranged symmetrically around a square with side c, as shown in the lower part of the diagram. This results in a larger square, with side a + b and area (a + b)2. The four triangles and the square side c must have the same area as the larger square, ( b + a ) 2 = c 2 + 4 a b 2 = c 2 + 2 a b , {\displaystyle (b+a)^{2}=c^{2}+4{\frac {ab}{2}}=c^{2}+2ab,} giving c 2 = ( b + a ) 2 − 2 a b = b 2 + 2 a b + a 2 − 2 a b = a 2 + b 2 . {\displaystyle c^{2}=(b+a)^{2}-2ab=b^{2}+2ab+a^{2}-2ab=a^{2}+b^{2}.} A similar proof uses four copies of a right triangle with sides a, b and c, arranged inside a square with side c as in the top half of the diagram. The triangles are similar with area 1 2 a b {\displaystyle {\tfrac {1}{2}}ab} , while the small square has side b − a and area (b − a)2. The area of the large square is therefore ( b − a ) 2 + 4 a b 2 = ( b − a ) 2 + 2 a b = b 2 − 2 a b + a 2 + 2 a b = a 2 + b 2 . {\displaystyle (b-a)^{2}+4{\frac {ab}{2}}=(b-a)^{2}+2ab=b^{2}-2ab+a^{2}+2ab=a^{2}+b^{2}.} But this is a square with side c and area c2, so c 2 = a 2 + b 2 . {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.} Other proofs of the theorem This theorem may have more known proofs than any other (the of being another contender for that distinction); the book The Pythagorean Proposition contains 370 proofs. Proof using similar triangles In this section, and as usual in geometry, a ""word"" of two capital letters, such as AB denotes the length of the defined by the points labeled with the letters, and not a multiplication. So, AB2 denotes the square of the length AB and not the product A × B 2 . {\displaystyle A\times B^{2}.} Proof using similar triangles This proof is based on the of the sides of three triangles, that is, upon the fact that the of any two corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same regardless of the size of the triangles. Let ABC represent a right triangle, with the located at C, as shown on the figure. Draw the from point C, and call H its intersection with the side AB. Point H divides the length of the hypotenuse c into parts d and e. The new triangle, ACH, is to triangle ABC, because they both have a right angle (by definition of the altitude), and they share the angle at A, meaning that the third angle will be the same in both triangles as well, marked as θ in the figure. By a similar reasoning, the triangle CBH is also similar to ABC. The proof of similarity of the triangles requires the : The sum of the angles in a triangle is two right angles, and is equivalent to the . Similarity of the triangles leads to the equality of ratios of corresponding sides: B C A B = B H B C and A C A B = A H A C . {\displaystyle {\frac {BC}{AB}}={\frac {BH}{BC}}{\text{ and }}{\frac {AC}{AB}}={\frac {AH}{AC}}.} The first result equates the of the angles θ, whereas the second result equates their . These ratios can be written as B C 2 = A B × B H and A C 2 = A B × A H . {\displaystyle BC^{2}=AB\times BH{\text{ and }}AC^{2}=AB\times AH.} Summing these two equalities results in B C 2 + A C 2 = A B × B H + A B × A H = A B ( A H + B H ) = A B 2 , {\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB\times BH+AB\times AH=AB(AH+BH)=AB^{2},} which, after simplification, demonstrates the Pythagorean theorem: B C 2 + A C 2 = A B 2 . {\displaystyle BC^{2}+AC^{2}=AB^{2}.} The role of this proof in history is the subject of much speculation. The underlying question is why Euclid did not use this proof, but invented another. One is that the proof by similar triangles involved a theory of proportions, a topic not discussed until later in the Elements, and that the theory of proportions needed further development at that time. Einstein's proof by dissection without rearrangement gave a proof by dissection in which the pieces do not need to be moved. Instead of using a square on the hypotenuse and two squares on the legs, one can use any other shape that includes the hypotenuse, and two shapes that each include one of two legs instead of the hypotenuse (see ). In Einstein's proof, the shape that includes the hypotenuse is the right triangle itself. The dissection consists of dropping a perpendicular from the vertex of the right angle of the triangle to the hypotenuse, thus splitting the whole triangle into two parts. Those two parts have the same shape as the original right triangle, and have the legs of the original triangle as their hypotenuses, and the sum of their areas is that of the original triangle. Because the ratio of the area of a right triangle to the square of its hypotenuse is the same for similar triangles, the relationship between the areas of the three triangles holds for the squares of the sides of the large triangle as well. Trigonometric proof using Einstein's construction Right triangle on the hypotenuse dissected into two similar right triangles on the legs, according to Einstein's proof. Both the and Einstein's proof rely on constructing the height to the of the right triangle △ A B C {\displaystyle \triangle ABC} . The same construction provides a proof of the Pythagorean theorem using the definition of the as a ratio inside a right triangle: sin ⁡ α = a c , {\displaystyle \sin \alpha ={\frac {a}{c}},} sin ⁡ β = b c , {\displaystyle \sin \beta ={\frac {b}{c}},} c = b sin ⁡ β + a sin ⁡ α = b 2 c + a 2 c , {\displaystyle c=b\sin \beta +a\sin \alpha ={\frac {b^{2}}{c}}+{\frac {a^{2}}{c}},} and thus c 2 = a 2 + b 2 . {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}.} This proof is essentially the same as the above proof using similar triangles, where some ratios of lengths are replaced by sines. Euclid's proof Proof in Euclid's Elements In outline, here is how the proof in 's proceeds. The large square is divided into a left and right rectangle. A triangle is constructed that has half the area of the left rectangle. Then another triangle is constructed that has half the area of the square on the left-most side. These two triangles are shown to be , proving this square has the same area as the left rectangle. This argument is followed by a similar version for the right rectangle and the remaining square. Putting the two rectangles together to reform the square on the hypotenuse, its area is the same as the sum of the area of the other two squares. The details follow. Let A, B, C be the of a right triangle, with a right angle at A. Drop a perpendicular from A to the side opposite the hypotenuse in the square on the hypotenuse. That line divides the square on the hypotenuse into two rectangles, each having the same area as one of the two squares on the legs. For the formal proof, we require four elementary : If two triangles have two sides of the one equal to two sides of the other, each to each, and the angles included by those sides equal, then the triangles are congruent (). The area of a triangle is half the area of any parallelogram on the same base and having the same altitude. The area of a rectangle is equal to the product of two adjacent sides. The area of a square is equal to the product of two of its sides (follows from 3). Next, each top square is related to a triangle congruent with another triangle related in turn to one of two rectangles making up the lower square. Illustration including the new lines Showing the two congruent triangles of half the area of rectangle BDLK and square BAGF The proof is as follows: Let ACB be a right-angled triangle with right angle CAB. On each of the sides BC, AB, and CA, squares are drawn, CBDE, BAGF, and ACIH, in that order. The construction of squares requires the immediately preceding theorems in Euclid, and depends upon the parallel postulate. From A, draw a line parallel to BD and CE. It will perpendicularly intersect BC and DE at K and L, respectively. Join CF and AD, to form the triangles BCF and BDA. Angles CAB and BAG are both right angles; therefore C, A, and G are . Angles CBD and FBA are both right angles; therefore angle ABD equals angle FBC, since both are the sum of a right angle and angle ABC. Since AB is equal to FB, BD is equal to BC and angle ABD equals angle FBC, triangle ABD must be congruent to triangle FBC. Since A-K-L is a straight line, parallel to BD, then rectangle BDLK has twice the area of triangle ABD because they share the base BD and have the same altitude BK, i.e., a line normal to their common base, connecting the parallel lines BD and AL. (lemma 2) Since C is collinear with A and G, and this line is parallel to FB, then square BAGF must be twice in area to triangle FBC. Therefore, rectangle BDLK must have the same area as square BAGF = AB2. By applying steps 3 to 10 to the other side of the figure, it can be similarly shown that rectangle CKLE must have the same area as square ACIH = AC2. Adding these two results, AB2 + AC2 = BD × BK + KL × KC Since BD = KL, BD × BK + KL × KC = BD(BK + KC) = BD × BC Therefore, AB2 + AC2 = BC2, since CBDE is a square. This proof, which appears in Euclid's Elements as that of Proposition 47 in Book 1, demonstrates that the area of the square on the hypotenuse is the sum of the areas of the other two squares. This is quite distinct from the proof by similarity of triangles, which is conjectured to be the proof that Pythagoras used. Proofs by dissection and rearrangement Another by rearrangement is given by the middle animation. A large square is formed with area c2, from four identical right triangles with sides a, b and c, fitted around a small central square. Then two rectangles are formed with sides a and b by moving the triangles. Combining the smaller square with these rectangles produces two squares of areas a2 and b2, which must have the same area as the initial large square. The third, rightmost image also gives a proof. The upper two squares are divided as shown by the blue and green shading, into pieces that when rearranged can be made to fit in the lower square on the hypotenuse – or conversely the large square can be divided as shown into pieces that fill the other two. This way of cutting one figure into pieces and rearranging them to get another figure is called . This shows the area of the large square equals that of the two smaller ones. Animation showing proof by rearrangement of four identical right triangles Animation showing another proof by rearrangement Proof using an elaborate rearrangement Proof by area-preserving shearing Visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem by area-preserving shearing As shown in the accompanying animation, area-preserving and translations can transform the squares on the sides adjacent to the right-angle onto the square on the hypotenuse, together covering it exactly. Each shear leaves the base and height unchanged, thus leaving the area unchanged too. The translations also leave the area unchanged, as they do not alter the shapes at all. Each square is first sheared into a parallelogram, and then into a rectangle which can be translated onto one section of the square on the hypotenuse. Other algebraic proofs A related proof was published by future U.S. President (then a ) (see diagram). Instead of a square it uses a , which can be constructed from the square in the second of the above proofs by bisecting along a diagonal of the inner square, to give the trapezoid as shown in the diagram. The can be calculated to be half the area of the square, that is 1 2 ( b + a ) 2 . {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}(b+a)^{2}.} The inner square is similarly halved, and there are only two triangles so the proof proceeds as above except for a factor of 1 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}} , which is removed by multiplying by two to give the result. Proof using differentials One can arrive at the Pythagorean theorem by studying how changes in a side produce a change in the hypotenuse and employing . The triangle ABC is a right triangle, as shown in the upper part of the diagram, with BC the hypotenuse. At the same time the triangle lengths are measured as shown, with the hypotenuse of length y, the side AC of length x and the side AB of length a, as seen in the lower diagram part. Diagram for differential proof If x is increased by a small amount dx by extending the side AC slightly to D, then y also increases by dy. These form two sides of a triangle, CDE, which (with E chosen so CE is perpendicular to the hypotenuse) is a right triangle approximately similar to ABC. Therefore, the ratios of their sides must be the same, that is: d y d x = x y . {\displaystyle {\frac {dy}{dx}}={\frac {x}{y}}.} This can be rewritten as y d y = x d x {\displaystyle y\,dy=x\,dx} , which is a that can be solved by direct integration: ∫ y d y = ∫ x d x , {\displaystyle \int y\,dy=\int x\,dx\,,} giving y 2 = x 2 + C . {\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+C.} The constant can be deduced from x = 0, y = a to give the equation y 2 = x 2 + a 2 . {\displaystyle y^{2}=x^{2}+a^{2}.} This is more of an intuitive proof than a formal one: it can be made more rigorous if proper limits are used in place of dx and dy. Converse The of the theorem is also true: Given a triangle with sides of length a, b, and c, if a2 + b2 = c2, then the angle between sides a and b is a . For any three positive a, b, and c such that a2 + b2 = c2, there exists a triangle with sides a, b and c as a consequence of the . This converse appears in Euclid's Elements (Book I, Proposition 48): ""If in a triangle the square on one of the sides equals the sum of the squares on the remaining two sides of the triangle, then the angle contained by the remaining two sides of the triangle is right."" It can be proved using the or as follows: Let ABC be a triangle with side lengths a, b, and c, with a2 + b2 = c2. Construct a second triangle with sides of length a and b containing a right angle. By the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that the hypotenuse of this triangle has length c = √a2 + b2, the same as the hypotenuse of the first triangle. Since both triangles' sides are the same lengths a, b and c, the triangles are and must have the same angles. Therefore, the angle between the side of lengths a and b in the original triangle is a right angle. The above proof of the converse makes use of the Pythagorean theorem itself. The converse can also be proved without assuming the Pythagorean theorem. A of the Pythagorean theorem's converse is a simple means of determining whether a triangle is right, obtuse, or acute, as follows. Let c be chosen to be the longest of the three sides and a + b > c (otherwise there is no triangle according to the ). The following statements apply: If a2 + b2 = c2, then the . If a2 + b2 > c2, then the . If a2 + b2 < c2, then the . has stated this proposition about acute, right, and obtuse triangles in this language: sgn(α + β − γ) = sgn(a2 + b2 − c2), where α is the angle opposite to side a, β is the angle opposite to side b, γ is the angle opposite to side c, and sgn is the . Consequences and uses of the theorem Pythagorean triples Main article: A Pythagorean triple has three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a2 + b2 = c2. In other words, a Pythagorean triple represents the lengths of the sides of a right triangle where all three sides have integer lengths. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c). Some well-known examples are (3, 4, 5) and (5, 12, 13). A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are (the of a, b and c is 1). The following is a list of primitive Pythagorean triples with values less than 100: (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (7, 24, 25), (8, 15, 17), (9, 40, 41), (11, 60, 61), (12, 35, 37), (13, 84, 85), (16, 63, 65), (20, 21, 29), (28, 45, 53), (33, 56, 65), (36, 77, 85), (39, 80, 89), (48, 55, 73), (65, 72, 97) Inverse Pythagorean theorem Given a with sides a , b , c {\displaystyle a,b,c} and d {\displaystyle d} (a line from the right angle and perpendicular to the c {\displaystyle c} ). The Pythagorean theorem has, a 2 + b 2 = c 2 {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}} while the relates the two a , b {\displaystyle a,b} to the altitude d {\displaystyle d} , 1 a 2 + 1 b 2 = 1 d 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{a^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{b^{2}}}={\frac {1}{d^{2}}}} The equation can be transformed to, 1 ( x z ) 2 + 1 ( y z ) 2 = 1 ( x y ) 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{(xz)^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{(yz)^{2}}}={\frac {1}{(xy)^{2}}}} where x 2 + y 2 = z 2 {\displaystyle x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}} for any non-zero x , y , z {\displaystyle x,y,z} . If the a , b , d {\displaystyle a,b,d} are to be , the smallest solution a > b > d {\displaystyle a>b>d} is then 1 20 2 + 1 15 2 = 1 12 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{20^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{15^{2}}}={\frac {1}{12^{2}}}} using the smallest Pythagorean triple 3 , 4 , 5 {\displaystyle 3,4,5} . The reciprocal Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the 1 p + 1 q = 1 r {\displaystyle {\frac {1}{p}}+{\frac {1}{q}}={\frac {1}{r}}} where the denominators are squares and also for a whose sides p , q , r {\displaystyle p,q,r} are square numbers. Incommensurable lengths The : A construction for line segments with lengths whose ratios are the square root of a positive integer One of the consequences of the Pythagorean theorem is that line segments whose lengths are (so the ratio of which is not a ) can be constructed using a . Pythagoras' theorem enables construction of incommensurable lengths because the hypotenuse of a triangle is related to the sides by the operation. The figure on the right shows how to construct line segments whose lengths are in the ratio of the square root of any positive integer. Each triangle has a side (labeled ""1"") that is the chosen unit for measurement. In each right triangle, Pythagoras' theorem establishes the length of the hypotenuse in terms of this unit. If a hypotenuse is related to the unit by the square root of a positive integer that is not a perfect square, it is a realization of a length incommensurable with the unit, such as √2, √3, √5 . For more detail, see . Incommensurable lengths conflicted with the Pythagorean school's concept of numbers as only whole numbers. The Pythagorean school dealt with proportions by comparison of integer multiples of a common subunit. According to one legend, (ca. 470 B.C.) was drowned at sea for making known the existence of the irrational or incommensurable. Complex numbers The absolute value of a complex number z is the distance r from z to the origin. For any z = x + i y , {\displaystyle z=x+iy,} the or modulus is given by r = | z | = x 2 + y 2 . {\displaystyle r=|z|={\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}.} So the three quantities, r, x and y are related by the Pythagorean equation, r 2 = x 2 + y 2 . {\displaystyle r^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}.} Note that r is defined to be a positive number or zero but x and y can be negative as well as positive. Geometrically r is the distance of the z from zero or the origin O in the . This can be generalised to find the distance between two points, z1 and z2 say. The required distance is given by | z 1 − z 2 | = ( x 1 − x 2 ) 2 + ( y 1 − y 2 ) 2 , {\displaystyle |z_{1}-z_{2}|={\sqrt {(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}}},} so again they are related by a version of the Pythagorean equation, | z 1 − z 2 | 2 = ( x 1 − x 2 ) 2 + ( y 1 − y 2 ) 2 . {\displaystyle |z_{1}-z_{2}|^{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}.} Euclidean distance Main article: The distance formula in is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. If (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are points in the plane, then the distance between them, also called the , is given by ( x 1 − x 2 ) 2 + ( y 1 − y 2 ) 2 . {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}}}.} More generally, in , the Euclidean distance between two points, A = ( a 1 , a 2 , … , a n ) {\displaystyle A\,=\,(a_{1},a_{2},\dots ,a_{n})} and B = ( b 1 , b 2 , … , b n ) {\displaystyle B\,=\,(b_{1},b_{2},\dots ,b_{n})} , is defined, by generalization of the Pythagorean theorem, as: ( a 1 − b 1 ) 2 + ( a 2 − b 2 ) 2 + ⋯ + ( a n − b n ) 2 = ∑ i = 1 n ( a i − b i ) 2 . {\displaystyle {\sqrt {(a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}+(a_{2}-b_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(a_{n}-b_{n})^{2}}}={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(a_{i}-b_{i})^{2}}}.} If instead of Euclidean distance, the square of this value (the , or SED) is used, the resulting equation avoids square roots and is simply a sum of the SED of the coordinates: ( a 1 − b 1 ) 2 + ( a 2 − b 2 ) 2 + ⋯ + ( a n − b n ) 2 = ∑ i = 1 n ( a i − b i ) 2 . {\displaystyle (a_{1}-b_{1})^{2}+(a_{2}-b_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(a_{n}-b_{n})^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}(a_{i}-b_{i})^{2}.} The squared form is a smooth, of both points, and is widely used in and , forming the basis of . Euclidean distance in other coordinate systems If Cartesian coordinates are not used, for example, if are used in two dimensions or, in more general terms, if are used, the formulas expressing the Euclidean distance are more complicated than the Pythagorean theorem, but can be derived from it. A typical example where the straight-line distance between two points is converted to curvilinear coordinates can be found in the . The formulas can be discovered by using Pythagoras' theorem with the equations relating the curvilinear coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. For example, the polar coordinates (r, θ) can be introduced as: x = r cos ⁡ θ , y = r sin ⁡ θ . {\displaystyle x=r\cos \theta ,\ y=r\sin \theta .} Then two points with locations (r1, θ1) and (r2, θ2) are separated by a distance s: s 2 = ( x 1 − x 2 ) 2 + ( y 1 − y 2 ) 2 = ( r 1 cos ⁡ θ 1 − r 2 cos ⁡ θ 2 ) 2 + ( r 1 sin ⁡ θ 1 − r 2 sin ⁡ θ 2 ) 2 . {\displaystyle s^{2}=(x_{1}-x_{2})^{2}+(y_{1}-y_{2})^{2}=(r_{1}\cos \theta _{1}-r_{2}\cos \theta _{2})^{2}+(r_{1}\sin \theta _{1}-r_{2}\sin \theta _{2})^{2}.} Performing the squares and combining terms, the Pythagorean formula for distance in Cartesian coordinates produces the separation in polar coordinates as: s 2 = r 1 2 + r 2 2 − 2 r 1 r 2 ( cos ⁡ θ 1 cos ⁡ θ 2 + sin ⁡ θ 1 sin ⁡ θ 2 ) = r 1 2 + r 2 2 − 2 r 1 r 2 cos ⁡ ( θ 1 − θ 2 ) = r 1 2 + r 2 2 − 2 r 1 r 2 cos ⁡ Δ θ , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}s^{2}&=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-2r_{1}r_{2}\left(\cos \theta _{1}\cos \theta _{2}+\sin \theta _{1}\sin \theta _{2}\right)\\&=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-2r_{1}r_{2}\cos \left(\theta _{1}-\theta _{2}\right)\\&=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}-2r_{1}r_{2}\cos \Delta \theta ,\end{aligned}}} using the trigonometric . This formula is the , sometimes called the generalized Pythagorean theorem. From this result, for the case where the radii to the two locations are at right angles, the enclosed angle Δθ = π/2, and the form corresponding to Pythagoras' theorem is regained: s 2 = r 1 2 + r 2 2 . {\displaystyle s^{2}=r_{1}^{2}+r_{2}^{2}.} The Pythagorean theorem, valid for right triangles, therefore is a special case of the more general law of cosines, valid for arbitrary triangles. Pythagorean trigonometric identity Main article: Similar right triangles showing sine and cosine of angle θ In a right triangle with sides a, b and hypotenuse c, determines the and of the angle θ between side a and the hypotenuse as: sin ⁡ θ = b c , cos ⁡ θ = a c . {\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {b}{c}},\quad \cos \theta ={\frac {a}{c}}.} From that it follows: cos 2 θ + sin 2 θ = a 2 + b 2 c 2 = 1 , {\displaystyle {\cos }^{2}\theta +{\sin }^{2}\theta ={\frac {a^{2}+b^{2}}{c^{2}}}=1,} where the last step applies Pythagoras' theorem. This relation between sine and cosine is sometimes called the fundamental Pythagorean trigonometric identity. In similar triangles, the ratios of the sides are the same regardless of the size of the triangles, and depend upon the angles. Consequently, in the figure, the triangle with hypotenuse of unit size has opposite side of size sin θ and adjacent side of size cos θ in units of the hypotenuse. Relation to the cross product The area of a parallelogram as a cross product; vectors a and b identify a plane and a × b is normal to this plane. The Pythagorean theorem relates the and in a similar way: ‖ a × b ‖ 2 + ( a ⋅ b ) 2 = ‖ a ‖ 2 ‖ b ‖ 2 . {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} \|^{2}+(\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} )^{2}=\|\mathbf {a} \|^{2}\|\mathbf {b} \|^{2}.} This can be seen from the definitions of the cross product and dot product, as a × b = a b n sin ⁡ θ a ⋅ b = a b cos ⁡ θ , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} &=ab\mathbf {n} \sin {\theta }\\\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} &=ab\cos {\theta },\end{aligned}}} with n a unit vector normal to both a and b. The relationship follows from these definitions and the Pythagorean trigonometric identity. This can also be used to define the cross product. By rearranging the following equation is obtained ‖ a × b ‖ 2 = ‖ a ‖ 2 ‖ b ‖ 2 − ( a ⋅ b ) 2 . {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {a} \times \mathbf {b} \|^{2}=\|\mathbf {a} \|^{2}\|\mathbf {b} \|^{2}-(\mathbf {a} \cdot \mathbf {b} )^{2}.} This can be considered as a condition on the cross product and so part of its definition, for example in . Generalizations Similar figures on the three sides The Pythagorean theorem generalizes beyond the areas of squares on the three sides to any . This was known by in the 5th century BC, and was included by in his : If one erects similar figures (see ) with corresponding sides on the sides of a right triangle, then the sum of the areas of the ones on the two smaller sides equals the area of the one on the larger side. This extension assumes that the sides of the original triangle are the corresponding sides of the three congruent figures (so the common ratios of sides between the similar figures are a:b:c). While Euclid's proof only applied to convex polygons, the theorem also applies to concave polygons and even to similar figures that have curved boundaries (but still with part of a figure's boundary being the side of the original triangle). The basic idea behind this generalization is that the area of a plane figure is to the square of any linear dimension, and in particular is proportional to the square of the length of any side. Thus, if similar figures with areas A, B and C are erected on sides with corresponding lengths a, b and c then: A a 2 = B b 2 = C c 2 , {\displaystyle {\frac {A}{a^{2}}}={\frac {B}{b^{2}}}={\frac {C}{c^{2}}}\,,} ⇒ A + B = a 2 c 2 C + b 2 c 2 C . {\displaystyle \Rightarrow A+B={\frac {a^{2}}{c^{2}}}C+{\frac {b^{2}}{c^{2}}}C\,.} But, by the Pythagorean theorem, a2 + b2 = c2, so A + B = C. Conversely, if we can prove that A + B = C for three similar figures without using the Pythagorean theorem, then we can work backwards to construct a proof of the theorem. For example, the starting center triangle can be replicated and used as a triangle C on its hypotenuse, and two similar right triangles (A and B ) constructed on the other two sides, formed by dividing the central triangle by its . The sum of the areas of the two smaller triangles therefore is that of the third, thus A + B = C and reversing the above logic leads to the Pythagorean theorem a2 + b2 = c2. (See also ) Generalization for similar triangles,green area A + B = blue area C Pythagoras' theorem using similar right triangles Generalization for regular pentagons Law of cosines Main article: The separation s of two points (r1, θ1) and (r2, θ2) in is given by the . Interior angle Δθ = θ1−θ2. The Pythagorean theorem is a special case of the more general theorem relating the lengths of sides in any triangle, the law of cosines, which states that a 2 + b 2 − 2 a b cos ⁡ θ = c 2 {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}-2ab\cos {\theta }=c^{2}} where θ {\displaystyle \theta } is the angle between sides a {\displaystyle a} and b {\displaystyle b} . When θ {\displaystyle \theta } is π 2 {\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{2}}} radians or 90°, then cos ⁡ θ = 0 {\displaystyle \cos {\theta }=0} , and the formula reduces to the usual Pythagorean theorem. Arbitrary triangle Generalization of Pythagoras' theorem by . Lower panel: reflection of triangle CAD (top) to form triangle DAC, similar to triangle ABC (top). At any selected angle of a general triangle of sides a, b, c, inscribe an isosceles triangle such that the equal angles at its base θ are the same as the selected angle. Suppose the selected angle θ is opposite the side labeled c. Inscribing the isosceles triangle forms triangle CAD with angle θ opposite side b and with side r along c. A second triangle is formed with angle θ opposite side a and a side with length s along c, as shown in the figure. stated that the sides of the three triangles were related as: a 2 + b 2 = c ( r + s ) . {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c(r+s)\ .} As the angle θ approaches π/2, the base of the isosceles triangle narrows, and lengths r and s overlap less and less. When θ = π/2, ADB becomes a right triangle, r + s = c, and the original Pythagorean theorem is regained. One proof observes that triangle ABC has the same angles as triangle CAD, but in opposite order. (The two triangles share the angle at vertex A, both contain the angle θ, and so also have the same third angle by the .) Consequently, ABC is similar to the reflection of CAD, the triangle DAC in the lower panel. Taking the ratio of sides opposite and adjacent to θ, c b = b r . {\displaystyle {\frac {c}{b}}={\frac {b}{r}}\ .} Likewise, for the reflection of the other triangle, c a = a s . {\displaystyle {\frac {c}{a}}={\frac {a}{s}}\ .} and adding these two relations: c s + c r = a 2 + b 2 , {\displaystyle cs+cr=a^{2}+b^{2}\ ,} the required result. The theorem remains valid if the angle θ {\displaystyle \theta } is obtuse so the lengths r and s are non-overlapping. General triangles using parallelograms Generalization for arbitrary triangles,green area = blue area Construction for proof of parallelogram generalization is a further generalization, that applies to triangles that are not right triangles, using parallelograms on the three sides in place of squares (squares are a special case, of course). The upper figure shows that for a scalene triangle, the area of the parallelogram on the longest side is the sum of the areas of the parallelograms on the other two sides, provided the parallelogram on the long side is constructed as indicated (the dimensions labeled with arrows are the same, and determine the sides of the bottom parallelogram). This replacement of squares with parallelograms bears a clear resemblance to the original Pythagoras' theorem, and was considered a generalization by in 4 AD The lower figure shows the elements of the proof. Focus on the left side of the figure. The left green parallelogram has the same area as the left, blue portion of the bottom parallelogram because both have the same base b and height h. However, the left green parallelogram also has the same area as the left green parallelogram of the upper figure, because they have the same base (the upper left side of the triangle) and the same height normal to that side of the triangle. Repeating the argument for the right side of the figure, the bottom parallelogram has the same area as the sum of the two green parallelograms. Solid geometry Pythagoras' theorem in three dimensions relates the diagonal AD to the three sides. A tetrahedron with outward facing right-angle corner In terms of , Pythagoras' theorem can be applied to three dimensions as follows. Consider a rectangular solid as shown in the figure. The length of diagonal BD is found from Pythagoras' theorem as: B D ¯ 2 = B C ¯ 2 + C D ¯ 2 , {\displaystyle {\overline {BD}}^{\,2}={\overline {BC}}^{\,2}+{\overline {CD}}^{\,2}\ ,} where these three sides form a right triangle. Using horizontal diagonal BD and the vertical edge AB, the length of diagonal AD then is found by a second application of Pythagoras' theorem as: A D ¯ 2 = A B ¯ 2 + B D ¯ 2 , {\displaystyle {\overline {AD}}^{\,2}={\overline {AB}}^{\,2}+{\overline {BD}}^{\,2}\ ,} or, doing it all in one step: A D ¯ 2 = A B ¯ 2 + B C ¯ 2 + C D ¯ 2 . {\displaystyle {\overline {AD}}^{\,2}={\overline {AB}}^{\,2}+{\overline {BC}}^{\,2}+{\overline {CD}}^{\,2}\ .} This result is the three-dimensional expression for the magnitude of a vector v (the diagonal AD) in terms of its orthogonal components {vk} (the three mutually perpendicular sides): ‖ v ‖ 2 = ∑ k = 1 3 ‖ v k ‖ 2 . {\displaystyle \|\mathbf {v} \|^{2}=\sum _{k=1}^{3}\|\mathbf {v} _{k}\|^{2}.} This one-step formulation may be viewed as a generalization of Pythagoras' theorem to higher dimensions. However, this result is really just the repeated application of the original Pythagoras' theorem to a succession of right triangles in a sequence of orthogonal planes. A substantial generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to three dimensions is , named for : If a has a right angle corner (like a corner of a ), then the square of the area of the face opposite the right angle corner is the sum of the squares of the areas of the other three faces. This result can be generalized as in the ""n-dimensional Pythagorean theorem"": Let x 1 , x 2 , … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,x_{n}} be orthogonal vectors in Rn. Consider the n-dimensional simplex S with vertices 0 , x 1 , … , x n {\displaystyle 0,x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}} . (Think of the (n − 1)-dimensional simplex with vertices x 1 , … , x n {\displaystyle x_{1},\ldots ,x_{n}} not including the origin as the ""hypotenuse"" of S and the remaining (n − 1)-dimensional faces of S as its ""legs"".) Then the square of the volume of the hypotenuse of S is the sum of the squares of the volumes of the n legs. This statement is illustrated in three dimensions by the tetrahedron in the figure. The ""hypotenuse"" is the base of the tetrahedron at the back of the figure, and the ""legs"" are the three sides emanating from the vertex in the foreground. As the depth of the base from the vertex increases, the area of the ""legs"" increases, while that of the base is fixed. The theorem suggests that when this depth is at the value creating a right vertex, the generalization of Pythagoras' theorem applies. In a different wording: Given an n-rectangular n-dimensional simplex, the square of the (n − 1)-content of the opposing the right vertex will equal the sum of the squares of the (n − 1)-contents of the remaining facets. Inner product spaces Vectors involved in the parallelogram law The Pythagorean theorem can be generalized to , which are generalizations of the familiar 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional . For example, a may be considered as a with infinitely many components in an inner product space, as in . In an inner product space, the concept of perpendicularity is replaced by the concept of orthogonality: two vectors v and w are orthogonal if their inner product ⟨ v , w ⟩ {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {w} \rangle } is zero. The inner product is a generalization of the dot product of vectors. The dot product is called the standard inner product or the Euclidean inner product. However, other inner products are possible. The concept of length is replaced by the concept of the norm ‖v‖ of a vector v, defined as: ‖ v ‖ ≡ ⟨ v , v ⟩ . {\displaystyle \lVert \mathbf {v} \rVert \equiv {\sqrt {\langle \mathbf {v} ,\mathbf {v} \rangle }}\,.} In an inner-product space, the Pythagorean theorem states that for any two orthogonal vectors v and w we have ‖ v + w ‖ 2 = ‖ v ‖ 2 + ‖ w ‖ 2 . {\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2}=\left\|\mathbf {v} \right\|^{2}+\left\|\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2}.} Here the vectors v and w are akin to the sides of a right triangle with hypotenuse given by the vector sum v + w. This form of the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of the properties of the inner product: ‖ v + w ‖ 2 = ⟨ v + w , v + w ⟩ = ⟨ v , v ⟩ + ⟨ w , w ⟩ + ⟨ v , w ⟩ + ⟨ w , v ⟩ = ‖ v ‖ 2 + ‖ w ‖ 2 , {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left\|\mathbf {v} +\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2}&=\langle \mathbf {v+w} ,\ \mathbf {v+w} \rangle \\[3mu]&=\langle \mathbf {v} ,\ \mathbf {v} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {w} ,\ \mathbf {w} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {v,\ w} \rangle +\langle \mathbf {w,\ v} \rangle \\[3mu]&=\left\|\mathbf {v} \right\|^{2}+\left\|\mathbf {w} \right\|^{2},\end{aligned}}} where ⟨ v , w ⟩ = ⟨ w , v ⟩ = 0 {\displaystyle \langle \mathbf {v,\ w} \rangle =\langle \mathbf {w,\ v} \rangle =0} because of orthogonality. A further generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in an inner product space to non-orthogonal vectors is the : 2 ‖ v ‖ 2 + 2 ‖ w ‖ 2 = ‖ v + w ‖ 2 + ‖ v − w ‖ 2 , {\displaystyle 2\|\mathbf {v} \|^{2}+2\|\mathbf {w} \|^{2}=\|\mathbf {v+w} \|^{2}+\|\mathbf {v-w} \|^{2}\ ,} which says that twice the sum of the squares of the lengths of the sides of a parallelogram is the sum of the squares of the lengths of the diagonals. Any norm that satisfies this equality is a norm corresponding to an inner product. The Pythagorean identity can be extended to sums of more than two orthogonal vectors. If v1, v2, ..., vn are pairwise-orthogonal vectors in an inner-product space, then application of the Pythagorean theorem to successive pairs of these vectors (as described for 3-dimensions in the section on solid geometry) results in the equation ‖ ∑ k = 1 n v k ‖ 2 = ∑ k = 1 n ‖ v k ‖ 2 {\displaystyle \left\|\sum _{k=1}^{n}\mathbf {v} _{k}\right\|^{2}=\sum _{k=1}^{n}\|\mathbf {v} _{k}\|^{2}} Sets of m-dimensional objects in n-dimensional space Another generalization of the Pythagorean theorem applies to sets of objects in any number of dimensions. Specifically, the square of the measure of an m-dimensional set of objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional in n-dimensional is equal to the sum of the squares of the measures of the projections of the object(s) onto all m-dimensional coordinate subspaces. In mathematical terms: μ m s 2 = ∑ i = 1 x μ 2 m p i {\displaystyle \mu _{ms}^{2}=\sum _{i=1}^{x}\mathbf {\mu ^{2}} _{mp_{i}}} where: μ m {\displaystyle \mu _{m}} is a measure in m-dimensions (a length in one dimension, an area in two dimensions, a volume in three dimensions, etc.). s {\displaystyle s} is a set of one or more non-overlapping m-dimensional objects in one or more parallel m-dimensional flats in n-dimensional Euclidean space. μ m s {\displaystyle \mu _{ms}} is the total measure (sum) of the set of m-dimensional objects. p {\displaystyle p} represents an m-dimensional projection of the original set onto an orthogonal coordinate subspace. μ m p i {\displaystyle \mu _{mp_{i}}} is the measure of the m-dimensional set projection onto m-dimensional coordinate subspace i {\displaystyle i} . Because object projections can overlap on a coordinate subspace, the measure of each object projection in the set must be calculated individually, then measures of all projections added together to provide the total measure for the set of projections on the given coordinate subspace. x {\displaystyle x} is the number of orthogonal, m-dimensional coordinate subspaces in n-dimensional space (Rn) onto which the m-dimensional objects are projected (m ≤ n): x = ( n m ) = n ! m ! ( n − m ) ! {\displaystyle x={\binom {n}{m}}={\frac {n!}{m!(n-m)!}}} Non-Euclidean geometry The Pythagorean theorem is derived from the of , and in fact, were the Pythagorean theorem to fail for some right triangle, then the plane in which this triangle is contained cannot be Euclidean. More precisely, the Pythagorean theorem . Thus, right triangles in a do not satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. For example, in , all three sides of the right triangle (say a, b, and c) bounding an octant of the unit sphere have length equal to π/2, and all its angles are right angles, which violates the Pythagorean theorem because a 2 + b 2 = 2 c 2 > c 2 {\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=2c^{2}>c^{2}} . Here two cases of non-Euclidean geometry are considered— and ; in each case, as in the Euclidean case for non-right triangles, the result replacing the Pythagorean theorem follows from the appropriate law of cosines. However, the Pythagorean theorem remains true in hyperbolic geometry and elliptic geometry if the condition that the triangle be right is replaced with the condition that two of the angles sum to the third, say A+B = C. The sides are then related as follows: the sum of the areas of the circles with diameters a and b equals the area of the circle with diameter c. Spherical geometry Spherical triangle For any right of radius R (for example, if γ in the figure is a right angle), with sides a, b, c, the relation between the sides takes the form: cos ⁡ c R = cos ⁡ a R cos ⁡ b R . {\displaystyle \cos {\frac {c}{R}}=\cos {\frac {a}{R}}\,\cos {\frac {b}{R}}.} This equation can be derived as a special case of the that applies to all spherical triangles: cos ⁡ c R = cos ⁡ a R cos ⁡ b R + sin ⁡ a R sin ⁡ b R cos ⁡ γ . {\displaystyle \cos {\frac {c}{R}}=\cos {\frac {a}{R}}\,\cos {\frac {b}{R}}+\sin {\frac {a}{R}}\,\sin {\frac {b}{R}}\,\cos {\gamma }.} For infinitesimal triangles on the sphere (or equivalently, for finite spherical triangles on a sphere of infinite radius), the spherical relation between the sides of a right triangle reduces to the Euclidean form of the Pythagorean theorem. To see how, assume we have a spherical triangle of fixed side lengths a, b, and c on a sphere with expanding radius R. As R approaches infinity the quantities a/R, b/R, and c/R tend to zero and the spherical Pythagorean identity reduces to 1 = 1 , {\displaystyle 1=1,} so we must look at its . The for the cosine function can be written as cos ⁡ x = 1 − 1 2 x 2 + O ( x 4 ) {\textstyle \cos x=1-{\tfrac {1}{2}}x^{2}+O{\left(x^{4}\right)}} with the remainder term in . Letting x = c / R {\displaystyle x=c/R} be a side of the triangle, and treating the expression as an asymptotic expansion in terms of R for a fixed c, cos ⁡ c R = 1 − c 2 2 R 2 + O ( R − 4 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\cos {\frac {c}{R}}=1-{\frac {c^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}\end{aligned}}} and likewise for a and b. Substituting the asymptotic expansion for each of the cosines into the spherical relation for a right triangle yields 1 − c 2 2 R 2 + O ( R − 4 ) = ( 1 − a 2 2 R 2 + O ( R − 4 ) ) ( 1 − b 2 2 R 2 + O ( R − 4 ) ) = 1 − a 2 2 R 2 − b 2 2 R 2 + O ( R − 4 ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}1-{\frac {c^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}&=\left(1-{\frac {a^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}\right)\left(1-{\frac {b^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}\right)\\&=1-{\frac {a^{2}}{2R^{2}}}-{\frac {b^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}.\end{aligned}}} Subtracting 1 and then negating each side, c 2 2 R 2 = a 2 2 R 2 + b 2 2 R 2 + O ( R − 4 ) . {\displaystyle {\frac {c^{2}}{2R^{2}}}={\frac {a^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+{\frac {b^{2}}{2R^{2}}}+O{\left(R^{-4}\right)}.} Multiplying through by 2R2, the asymptotic expansion for c in terms of fixed a, b and variable R is c 2 = a 2 + b 2 + O ( R − 2 ) . {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}+O{\left(R^{-2}\right)}.} The Euclidean Pythagorean relationship c 2 = a 2 + b 2 {\textstyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}} is recovered in the limit, as the remainder vanishes when the radius R approaches infinity. For practical computation in spherical trigonometry with small right triangles, cosines can be replaced with sines using the double-angle identity cos ⁡ 2 θ = 1 − 2 sin 2 ⁡ θ {\displaystyle \cos {2\theta }=1-2\sin ^{2}{\theta }} to avoid . Then the spherical Pythagorean theorem can alternately be written as sin 2 ⁡ c 2 R = sin 2 ⁡ a 2 R + sin 2 ⁡ b 2 R − 2 sin 2 ⁡ a 2 R sin 2 ⁡ b 2 R . {\displaystyle \sin ^{2}{\frac {c}{2R}}=\sin ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}+\sin ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}-2\sin ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}\,\sin ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}.} Hyperbolic geometry In a space with uniform −1/R2, for a right with legs a, b, and hypotenuse c, the relation between the sides takes the form: cosh ⁡ c R = cosh ⁡ a R cosh ⁡ b R {\displaystyle \cosh {\frac {c}{R}}=\cosh {\frac {a}{R}}\,\cosh {\frac {b}{R}}} where cosh is the . This formula is a special form of the that applies to all hyperbolic triangles: cosh ⁡ c R = cosh ⁡ a R cosh ⁡ b R − sinh ⁡ a R sinh ⁡ b R cos ⁡ γ , {\displaystyle \cosh {\frac {c}{R}}=\cosh {\frac {a}{R}}\ \cosh {\frac {b}{R}}-\sinh {\frac {a}{R}}\ \sinh {\frac {b}{R}}\ \cos \gamma \ ,} with γ the angle at the vertex opposite the side c. By using the for the hyperbolic cosine, cosh x ≈ 1 + x2/2, it can be shown that as a hyperbolic triangle becomes very small (that is, as a, b, and c all approach zero), the hyperbolic relation for a right triangle approaches the form of Pythagoras' theorem. For small right triangles (a, b << R), the hyperbolic cosines can be eliminated to avoid , giving sinh 2 ⁡ c 2 R = sinh 2 ⁡ a 2 R + sinh 2 ⁡ b 2 R + 2 sinh 2 ⁡ a 2 R sinh 2 ⁡ b 2 R . {\displaystyle \sinh ^{2}{\frac {c}{2R}}=\sinh ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}+\sinh ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}+2\sinh ^{2}{\frac {a}{2R}}\sinh ^{2}{\frac {b}{2R}}\,.} Very small triangles For any uniform curvature K (positive, zero, or negative), in very small right triangles (|K|a2, |K|b2 << 1) with hypotenuse c, it can be shown that c 2 = a 2 + b 2 − K 3 a 2 b 2 − K 2 45 a 2 b 2 ( a 2 + b 2 ) − 2 K 3 945 a 2 b 2 ( a 2 − b 2 ) 2 + O ( K 4 c 10 ) . {\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-{\frac {K}{3}}a^{2}b^{2}-{\frac {K^{2}}{45}}a^{2}b^{2}(a^{2}+b^{2})-{\frac {2K^{3}}{945}}a^{2}b^{2}(a^{2}-b^{2})^{2}+O(K^{4}c^{10})\,.} Differential geometry Distance between infinitesimally separated points in (top) and (bottom), as given by Pythagoras' theorem The Pythagorean theorem applies to triangles seen in . In three dimensional space, the distance between two infinitesimally separated points satisfies d s 2 = d x 2 + d y 2 + d z 2 , {\displaystyle ds^{2}=dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dz^{2},} with ds the element of distance and (dx, dy, dz) the components of the vector separating the two points. Such a space is called a . However, in , a generalization of this expression useful for general coordinates (not just Cartesian) and general spaces (not just Euclidean) takes the form: d s 2 = ∑ i , j n g i j d x i d x j {\displaystyle ds^{2}=\sum _{i,j}^{n}g_{ij}\,dx_{i}\,dx_{j}} which is called the . (Sometimes, by abuse of language, the same term is applied to the set of coefficients gij.) It may be a function of position, and often describes . A simple example is Euclidean (flat) space expressed in . For example, in : d s 2 = d r 2 + r 2 d θ 2 . {\displaystyle ds^{2}=dr^{2}+r^{2}d\theta ^{2}\ .} History The records from times. There is debate whether the Pythagorean theorem was discovered once, or many times in many places, and the date of first discovery is uncertain, as is the date of the first proof. Historians of mathematics have concluded that the Pythagorean rule was in widespread use during the (20th to 16th centuries BC), over a thousand years before was born. The history of the theorem can be divided into four parts: knowledge of , knowledge of the relationship among the sides of a right triangle, knowledge of the relationships among adjacent angles, and proofs of the theorem within some . Written c. 1800 BC, the includes a problem whose solution is the Pythagorean triple 6:8:10, but the problem does not mention a triangle. The Mesopotamian tablet , also written c. 1800 BC near , contains many entries closely related to Pythagorean triples. In , the , the dates of which are given variously as between the 8th and 5th century BC, contains a list of Pythagorean triples and a statement of the Pythagorean theorem, both in the special case of the and in the general case, as does the Shulba Sutra (c. 600 BC). philosopher and mathematician , writing in the fifth century AD, states two arithmetic rules, ""one of them attributed to , the other to Pythagoras"", for generating special Pythagorean triples. The rule attributed to Pythagoras (c. 570 – c. 495 BC) starts from an and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by one unit; the rule attributed to Plato (428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC) starts from an even number and produces a triple with leg and hypotenuse differing by two units. According to (1861–1940), no specific attribution of the theorem to Pythagoras exists in the surviving Greek literature from the five centuries after Pythagoras lived. However, when authors such as and attributed the theorem to Pythagoras, they did so in a way which suggests that the attribution was widely known and undoubted. wrote, ""Whether this formula is rightly attributed to Pythagoras personally, but one can safely assume that it belongs to the very oldest period of ."" Around 300 BC, in Euclid's Elements, the oldest extant of the theorem is presented. Geometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem from the With contents known much earlier, but in surviving texts dating from roughly the 1st century BC, the Chinese text (周髀算经), (The Arithmetical Classic of the and the Circular Paths of Heaven) gives a reasoning for the Pythagorean theorem for the (3, 4, 5) triangle — in China it is called the ""Gougu theorem"" (勾股定理). During the Han Dynasty (202 BC to 220 AD), Pythagorean triples appear in , together with a mention of right triangles. Some believe the theorem arose first in China, where it is alternatively known as the ""Shang Gao theorem"" (商高定理), named after the Duke of Zhou's astronomer and mathematician, whose reasoning composed most of what was in the Zhoubi Suanjing. See also Notes and references Notes Van der Waerden believed that this material ""was certainly based on earlier traditions"". Carl Boyer states that the Pythagorean theorem in the may have been influenced by ancient Mesopotamian math, but there is no conclusive evidence in favor or opposition of this possibility.

It is called ""Pythagoras' Theorem"" and can be written in one short equation: a2 + b2 = c2 Note: c is the longest side of the triangle a and b are the other two sides Definition The longest side of the triangle is called the ""hypotenuse"", so the formal definition is: In a right angled triangle: the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Sure ... ? Let's see if it really works using an example. Example: A has a right angle in it. Let's check if the areas are the same: 32 + 42 = 52 Calculating this becomes: 9 + 16 = 25 It works ... like Magic! Why Is This Useful? If we know the lengths of two sides of a right angled triangle, we can find the length of the third side. (But remember it only works on right angled triangles!) How Do I Use it? Write it down as an equation: a2 + b2 = c2 Then we use to find any missing value, as in these examples: Example: Solve this triangle Start with:a2 + b2 = c2 Put in what we know:52 + 122 = c2 Calculate squares:25 + 144 = c2 25+144=169:169 = c2 Swap sides:c2 = 169 Square root of both sides:c = √169 Calculate:c = 13 Read to see practical uses for this. Also read about to find out why √169 = 13 Example: Solve this triangle. Start with:a2 + b2 = c2 Put in what we know:92 + b2 = 152 Calculate squares:81 + b2 = 225 Take 81 from both sides: 81 − 81 + b2 = 225 − 81 Calculate: b2 = 144 Square root of both sides:b = √144 Calculate:b = 12 Example: What is the diagonal distance across a square of size 1? Start with:a2 + b2 = c2 Put in what we know:12 + 12 = c2 Calculate squares:1 + 1 = c2 1+1=2: 2 = c2 Swap sides: c2 = 2 Square root of both sides:c = √2 Which is about:c = 1.4142... It works the other way around, too: when the three sides of a triangle make a2 + b2 = c2, then the triangle is right angled. Example: Does this triangle have a Right Angle? Does a2 + b2 = c2 ? a2 + b2 = 102 + 242 = 100 + 576 = 676 c2 = 262 = 676 They are equal, so ... Yes, it does have a Right Angle! Example: Does an 8, 15, 16 triangle have a Right Angle? Does 82 + 152 = 162 ? 82 + 152 = 64 + 225 = 289, but 162 = 256 So, NO, it does not have a Right Angle Example: Does this triangle have a Right Angle? Does a2 + b2 = c2 ? Does (√3)2 + (√5)2 = (√8)2 ? Does 3 + 5 = 8 ? Yes, it does! So this is a right-angled triangle And You Can Prove The Theorem Yourself ! Get paper pen and scissors, then using the following animation as a guide: Draw a right angled triangle on the paper, leaving plenty of space. Draw a square along the hypotenuse (the longest side) Draw the same sized square on the other side of the hypotenuse Draw lines as shown on the animation, like this: Cut out the shapes Arrange them so that you can prove that the big square has the same area as the two squares on the other sides Another, Amazingly Simple, Proof Here is one of the oldest proofs that the square on the long side has the same area as the other squares. Watch the animation, and pay attention when the triangles start sliding around. You may want to watch the animation a few times to understand what is happening. The purple triangle is the important one. becomes We also have a .

The a and b are the 2 ""non-hypotenuse"" sides of the triangle (Opposite and Adjacent). Once you progress, you will be given the hypotenuse and would be needed to find the opposite or the adjacent side (a or b). The Pythagorean theorem is a simple formula which uses the squared value of a and b; for example ""a=3 and b=4, what is the value of c?"" you square a (3^2=9=a) and b (4^2=16=b) and add the 2 values (9+16=25) to get to c. To complete the question, you have to square root c's value (square root of 25=5) because the formula says c^2 and not just c. Once you have done that, you can check your answer by squaring a,b and c to see if you have added and divided (Square-rooted) correctly.

Don't worry, I'm going to make it as fun and exciting as a roller coaster ride. 🎢So, picture this: you're on a quest to uncover the secrets of right triangles. What's a right triangle, you ask? It's like a ninja triangle that has one angle that's super square – like the corners of your favorite chocolate bar. And guess what? The Pythagorean theorem is like the secret map that helps you unravel the mystery of their sides.Let's meet our triangle heroes: the legs (let's call them Alex and Bella) and the hypotenuse (let's call it Charlie). Alex and Bella are the sides that stick around the right angle, and Charlie is the longest side that stretches across like a superhero cape.Now, the Pythagorean theorem is like a fancy spell that connects Alex, Bella, and Charlie. It's written as ""Alex squared plus Bella squared equals Charlie squared."" Math wizards use letters to stand in for numbers, so ""squared"" just means you multiply a number by itself. 🧙‍♂️Let's break down our secret spell:""Alex"" is one of the leg's lengths, and ""Bella"" is the other leg's length. Imagine they're talking to each other, going ""Hey, I'm Alex!"" and ""Hi, I'm Bella!"" Cute, right?""Charlie"" is the hypotenuse's length. Charlie's like, ""I'm the cool slanty side over here!""When we say ""Alex squared,"" it's like saying ""Alex times Alex."" Same goes for ""Bella squared"" and ""Charlie squared.""So, when we say ""Alex squared plus Bella squared equals Charlie squared,"" we're saying ""Alex times Alex plus Bella times Bella equals Charlie times Charlie."" It's like a math party with letters dancing around!Let's rock this with an example. Imagine Alex is 3 units long and Bella is 4 units long. Our goal? Figure out how long Charlie is. Ready?First, we square Alex: 3² = 9. Imagine Alex's square dance moves!Then, we square Bella: 4² = 16. Bella's got some smooth square moves too!Now, we add Alex's square and Bella's square: 9 + 16 = 25. It's a party, and the dance floor is lit!Finally, we need to know how long Charlie is, so we take the square root of 25: √25 = 5. Charlie's got some severe superhero vibes!So, in our awesome triangle adventure, Charlie, the hypotenuse is five units long. Ta-da! 🎉The Pythagorean theorem isn't just for math class; it's like a puzzle-solving tool that architects, engineers, and even treasure hunters use. Imagine building a treehouse with Alex and Bella, making sure Charlie's rope ladder is just the right length. Or imagine searching for hidden treasure, using the theorem to measure how far X marks the spot.So, whether exploring ancient mysteries or creating your own superhero squad of triangles, remember that the Pythagorean theorem is your trusty sidekick. It's a dance of numbers that unlocks the secrets of right triangles, making math an epic adventure filled with discovery and a dash of superhero magic! 🦸‍♂️🔮🌟CommentButton navigates to signup page(1 vote)Upvote Button opens signup modalDownvote Button opens signup modalFlag Button opens signup modalmoreShow more...morehow do you do thisAnswerButton navigates to signup page•2 commentsComment on gregory.mcniven's post “how do you do this”(6 votes)Upvote Button opens signup modalDownvote Button opens signup modalFlag Button opens signup modalmoreAnswerShow previewShow formatting optionsPost answermoreWatch the video.

But you'll see as you learn more and more mathematics it's one of those cornerstone theorems of really all of math. It's useful in geometry, it's kind of the backbone of trigonometry. You're also going to use it to calculate distances between points. So it's a good thing to really make sure we know well. So enough talk on my end. Let me tell you what the Pythagorean theorem is. So if we have a triangle, and the triangle has to be a right triangle, which means that one of the three angles in the triangle have to be 90 degrees. And you specify that it's 90 degrees by drawing that little box right there. So that right there is-- let me do this in a different color-- a 90 degree angle. Or, we could call it a right angle. And a triangle that has a right angle in it is called a right triangle. So this is called a right triangle. Now, with the Pythagorean"

Some of the generalizations are far from obvious. Pythagorean theorem serves as the basis of the came up with a plane generalization which is related to the but is shorter and looks nicer. The Theorem whose formulation leads to the notion of and Euclidean and Hilbert spaces, plays an in Mathematics as a whole. There is a small collection of rather elementray facts whose on the Pythagorean Theorem. There is a with a list of properties of the Euclidian diagram for . Wherever all three sides of a right triangle are integers, their lengths form a Pythagorean triple (or Pythagorean numbers). There is a for obtaining all such numbers. My first was also related to the Pythagorean theorem. Unlike a , a droodle may suggest a statement, not just a proof. Several false proofs of the theorem have also been published. I have collected a few in a . It is better to learn from mistakes of others than to commit one's own. It is known that the being probably the most popular. Besides the statement of the Pythagorean theorem, Bride's chair has many interesting properties, many quite elementary. The late Professor found an absolutely stunning of the Pythagorean theorem. If, in a triangle, angles α, β, γ lie opposite the sides of length a, b, c, then (EWD) sign(α + β - γ) = sign(a² + b² - c²), where sign(t) is the signum function: sign(t)= -1, for t < 0, sign(0)= 0, sign(t)= 1, for t > 0. The theorem this page is devoted to is treated as ""If γ = p/2, then a² + b² = c²."" Dijkstra deservedly finds more symmetric and more informative. Absence of quantities (p) is judged to be an additional advantage. Dijkstra's proof is included as and is covered in more detail on a . The most famous of right-angled triangles, the one with dimensions 3:4:5, has been sighted in and can be obtained by . Rather inadvertently, it pops up in several . Perhaps not surprisingly, the Pythagorean theorem is a consequence of various physical laws and in several mechanical phenomena. Proof #1 This is probably the most famous of all proofs of the Pythagorean proposition. It's the first of Euclid's two proofs (I.47). The underlying configuration became known under a variety of names, the likely being the most popular. The proof has been illustrated by an award winning Java applet written by Jim Morey. I include it on a with Jim's kind permission. The proof below is a somewhat shortened version of the original Euclidean proof as it appears in . First of all, ΔABF = ΔAEC by . This is because, AE = AB, AF = AC, and ∠BAF = ∠BAC + ∠CAF = ∠CAB + ∠BAE = ∠CAE. ΔABF has base AF and the altitude from B equal to AC. Its area therefore equals half that of square on the side AC. On the other hand, ΔAEC has AE and the altitude from C equal to AM, where M is the point of intersection of AB with the line CL parallel to AE. Thus the area of ΔAEC equals half that of the rectangle AELM. Which says that the area AC² of the square on side AC equals the area of the rectangle AELM. Similarly, the area BC² of the square on side BC equals that of rectangle BMLD. Finally, the two rectangles AELM and BMLD make up the square on the hypotenuse AB. The configuration at hand admits numerous variations. B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead (Am Math Monthly, v.4, n 6/7, (1987), 168-170 published several proofs based on the following diagrams Some properties of this configuration has been proved on the and others at the special page. Proof #2 We start with two squares with sides a and b, respectively, placed side by side. The total area of the two squares is a²+b². The construction did not start with a triangle but now we draw two of them, both with sides a and b and hypotenuse c. Note that the segment common to the two squares has been removed. At this point we therefore have two triangles and a strange looking shape. As a last step, we rotate the triangles 90°, each around its top vertex. The right one is rotated clockwise whereas the left triangle is rotated counterclockwise. Obviously the resulting shape is a square with the side c and area c². This proof appears in a dynamic incarnation. (A variant of this proof is found in an extant manuscript by Thâbit ibn Qurra located in the library of Aya Sofya Musium in Turkey, registered under the number 4832. [R. Shloming, Thâbit ibn Qurra and the Pythagorean Theorem, Mathematics Teacher 63 (Oct., 1970), 519-528]. ibn Qurra's diagram is similar to that in . The proof itself starts with noting the presence of four equal right triangles surrounding a strangely looking shape as in the current proof #2. These four triangles correspond in pairs to the starting and ending positions of the rotated triangles in the current proof. This same configuration could be observed in a .) Proof #3 Now we start with four copies of the same triangle. Three of these have been rotated 90°, 180°, and 270°, respectively. Each has area ab/2. Let's put them together without additional rotations so that they form a square with side c. The square has a square hole with the side (a - b). Summing up its area (a - b)² and 2ab, the area of the four triangles (4·ab/2), we get c²= (a - b)² + 2ab = a² - 2ab + b² + 2ab = a² + b² Proof #4 The fourth approach starts with the same four triangles, except that, this time, they combine to form a square with the side (a + b) and a hole with the side c. We can compute the area of the big square in two ways. Thus (a + b)² = 4·ab/2 + c² simplifying which we get the needed identity. A proof which combines this with is credited to the 12th century Hindu mathematician Bhaskara (Bhaskara II): (p. 4) gives Bhaskara credit also for . Here we add the two identities c² = (a - b)² + 4·ab/2 and c² = (a + b)² - 4·ab/2 which gives 2c² = 2a² + 2b². The latter needs only be divided by 2. This is the algebraic proof # 36 in . Its variant, specifically applied to the , has featured in the Chinese classic Chou Pei Suan Ching dated somewhere between 300 BC and 200 AD and which Loomis refers to as proof 253. Proof #5 This proof, discovered by President J. A. Garfield in 1876 [], is a variation on the previous one. But this time we draw no squares at all. The key now is the formula for the area of a trapezoid - half sum of the bases times the altitude - (a + b)/2·(a + b). Looking at the picture another way, this also can be computed as the sum of areas of the three triangles - ab/2 + ab/2 + c·c/2. As before, simplifications yield a² + b² = c². (There is more to that .) Two copies of the same trapezoid can be combined in two ways by attaching them along the slanted side of the trapezoid. One leads to the , the other to . : it also invokes an image of trapezoid but under in a different light. Proof #6 We start with the original right triangle, now denoted ABC, and need only one additional construct - the AD. The triangles ABC, DBA, and DAC are similar which leads to two ratios: AB/BC = BD/AB and AC/BC = DC/AC. Written another way these become AB·AB = BD·BC and AC·AC = DC·BC Summing up we get AB·AB + AC·AC= BD·BC + DC·BC = (BD+DC)·BC = BC·BC. In a little different form, this proof appeared in the Mathematics Magazine, 33 (March, 1950), p. 210, in the Mathematical Quickies section, see , by C. W. Trigg. Taking AB = a, AC = b, BC = c and denoting BD = x, we obtain as above a² = cx and b² = c(c - x), which perhaps more transparently leads to the same identity. In a private correspondence, Dr. France Dacar, Ljubljana, Slovenia, has suggested that the diagram on the right may serve two purposes. First, it gives an additional graphical representation to the present proof #6. In addition, it highlights the relation of the latter to . R. M. Mentock has observed that a little trick makes the proof more succinct. In the common notations, c = b cos A + a cos B. But, from the original triangle, it's easy to see that cos A = b/c and cos B = a/c so c = b (b/c) + a (a/c). This variant immediately brings up a question: are we getting in this manner a trigonometric proof? I do not think so, although a trigonometric function (cosine) makes here a prominent appearance. The ratio of two lengths in a figure is a meaning that it remains fixed in passing between similar figures, i.e., figures of the same shape. That a particular ratio used in the proof happened to play a sufficiently important role in trigonometry and, more generally, in mathematics, so as to deserve a special notation of its own, does not cause the proof to depend on that notation. (However, check where trigonometric identities are used in a significant way.) Michael Brozinsky came up with a that I believe could be properly referred to as lipogrammatic. Finally, it must be mentioned that the configuration exploited in this proof is just a specific case of the one from the next proof - Euclid's second and less known proof of the Pythagorean proposition. A separate page is devoted to a proof by the . Proof #7 The next proof is taken verbatim from Euclid VI.31 in translation by Sir Thomas L. Heath. The great G. Polya analyzes it in his Induction and Analogy in Mathematics (II.5) which is a recommended reading to students and teachers of Mathematics. In right-angled triangles the figure on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on the sides containing the right angle. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle having the angle BAC right; I say that the figure on BC is equal to the similar and similarly described figures on BA, AC. Let AD be drawn perpendicular. Then since, in the right-angled triangle ABC, AD has been drawn from the right angle at A perpendicular to the base BC, the triangles ABD, ADC adjoining the perpendicular are similar both to the whole ABC and to one another [VI.8]. And, since ABC is similar to ABD, therefore, as CB is to BA so is AB to BD [VI.Def.1]. And, since three straight lines are proportional, as the first is to the third, so is the figure on the first to the similar and similarly described figure on the second [VI.19]. Therefore, as CB is to BD, so is the figure on CB to the similar and similarly described figure on BA. For the same reason also, as BC is to CD, so is the figure on BC to that on CA; so that, in addition, as BC is to BD, DC, so is the figure on BC to the similar and similarly described figures on BA, AC. But BC is equal to BD, DC; therefore the figure on BC is also equal to the similar and similarly described figures on BA, AC. Therefore etc. Q.E.D. Confession I got a real appreciation of this proof only after reading the book by Polya I mentioned above. I hope that a will help you get to the bottom of this remarkable proof. Note that the statement actually proven is much more general than the theorem as it's generally known. ( looks at VI.31 from a little different angle.) John Arioni came up with a beautiful illustration that also sheds light on the proof #8. Proof #8 Playing with the applet that demonstrates the Euclid's proof (#7), I have discovered another one which, although ugly, serves the purpose nonetheless. Thus starting with the triangle 1 we add three more in the way suggested in proof #7: similar and similarly described triangles 2, 3, and 4. Deriving a couple of ratios as was done in proof #6 we arrive at the side lengths as depicted on the diagram. Now, it's possible to look at the final shape in two ways: as a union of the rectangle (1 + 3 + 4) and the triangle 2, or as a union of the rectangle (1 + 2) and two triangles 3 and 4. Equating the areas leads to ab/c · (a² + b²)/c + ab/2 = ab + (ab/c · a²/c + ab/c · b²/c)/2 Simplifying we get ab/c · (a² + b²)/c/2 = ab/2, or (a² + b²)/c² = 1 Remark In hindsight, there is a simpler proof. Look at the rectangle (1 + 3 + 4). Its long side is, on one hand, plain c, while, on the other hand, it's a²/c + b²/c and we again have the same identity. Vladimir Nikolin from Serbia supplied a beautiful illustration: Proof #9 Another proof stems from a rearrangement of rigid pieces, much like . It makes the algebraic part of completely redundant. There is nothing much one can add to the two pictures. (My sincere thanks go to for the kind permission to use the graphics.) There is an to toy with. And that clearly shows its relation to proofs or . (pp. 49-50) mentions that the proof ""was devised by Maurice Laisnez, a high school boy, in the Junior-Senior High School of South Bend, Ind., and sent to me, May 16, 1939, by his class teacher, Wilson Thornton."" The proof has been published by Rufus Isaac in Mathematics Magazine, Vol. 48 (1975), p. 198. A slightly different rearragement leads to a hinged dissection illustrated by a . reproduces the proof with a remark ""based on the one from Zhou bi suan jing, a Chinese document dating from approximately 200 BC."" Sir Thomas L. Heath mentions it in his commentary (1908) on Euclid I.47 without attribution but with a reference to two other contemporary commentators. Professor Xiaolin Zhong of UCLA came up with a version packed into a single square. ""The proof is obvious by simply moving and into and respectively."" Proof #10 This and the next 3 proofs came from []. The triangles in Proof #3 may be rearranged in yet another way that makes the Pythagorean identity obvious. (A more elucidating diagram on the right was kindly sent to me by . The proof admits a hinged dissection illustrated by a .) The first two pieces may be combined into one. The result appear in a 1830 book Sanpo Shinsyo - New Mathematics - by Chiba Tanehide (1775-1849), [H. Fukagawa, A. Rothman, , Princeton University Press, 2008, p. 83]. Proof #11 Draw a circle with radius c and a right triangle with sides a and b as shown. In this situation, one may apply any of a few well known facts. For example, in the diagram three points F, G, H located on the circle form another right triangle with the altitude FK of length a. Its hypotenuse GH is split in two pieces: (c + b) and (c - b). So, as in , we get a² = (c + b)(c - b) = c² - b². [, #53] attributes this construction to the great Leibniz, but lengthens the proof about threefold with meandering and misguided derivations. B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead (Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 12 (1896), 299-300) offer a somewhat different route. Imagine FK is extended to the second intersection F' with the circle. Then, by the theorem, FK·KF' = GK·KH, with the same implication. More recently, Daniel J. Hardisky, arrived at the proof by a different route. Construct two isosceles triangles and with and on on both sides of Then note that is right. This argument is reminescent of a characterization of right triangles discussed . Proof #12 This proof is a variation on #1, one of the original Euclid's proofs. In parts 1,2, and 3, the two small squares are sheared towards each other such that the total shaded area remains unchanged (and equal to a²+b².) In part 3, the length of the vertical portion of the shaded area's border is exactly c because the two leftover triangles are copies of the original one. This means one may slide down the shaded area as in part 4. From here the Pythagorean Theorem follows easily. (This proof can be found in H. Eves, , MAA, 2002, pp. 74-75) Proof #13 In the diagram there is several similar triangles (abc, a'b'c', a'x, and b'y.) We successively have y/b = b'/c, x/a = a'/c, cy + cx = aa' + bb'. And, finally, cc' = aa' + bb'. This is very much like Proof #6 but the result is more general. Proof #14 This proof by H.E. Dudeney (1917) starts by cutting the square on the larger side into four parts that are then combined with the smaller one to form the square built on the hypotenuse. from Purdue University, the author of a truly illuminating book, (Cambridge University Press, 1997), pointed out the historical inaccuracy: You attributed proof #14 to H.E. Dudeney (1917), but it was actually published earlier (1872) by Henry Perigal, a London stockbroker. A different dissection proof appeared much earlier, given by the Arabian mathematician/astronomer Thâbit in the tenth century. I have included details about these and other dissections proofs (including proofs of the Law of Cosines) in my recent book ""Dissections: Plane & Fancy"", Cambridge University Press, 1997. You might enjoy the web page for the book: Sincerely, Greg Frederickson Bill Casselman from the University of British Columbia Greg's information. Mine came from Proofs Without Words by R.B.Nelsen (MAA, 1993). The proof has a . Proof #15 This by K. O. Friedrichs is a generalization of the previous one by Dudeney (or by Perigal, as above). It's indeed general. It's general in the sense that an infinite variety of specific geometric proofs may be derived from it. (Roger Nelsen ascribes [, p 3] this proof to Annairizi of Arabia (ca. 900 A.D.)) An especially nice variant by Olof Hanner appears on a . A variant of the basic proof has been sent to me by Miquel Plens, a high school student from Catalonia. Miquel considers the overlap of eight squares on the three sides of a right triangle and the leftover pieces. I placed his submission on a . Proof #16 This proof is ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) []. Quadrilaterals ABHI, JHBC, ADGC, and EDGF are all equal. (This follows from the observation that the angle ABH is 45°. This is so because ABC is right-angled, thus center O of the square ACJI lies on the circle circumscribing triangle ABC. Obviously, angle ABO is 45°.) Now, Area(ABHI) + Area(JHBC) = Area(ADGC) + Area(EDGF). Each sum contains two areas of triangles equal to ABC (IJH or BEF) removing which one obtains the Pythagorean Theorem. David King modifies the argument somewhat The side lengths of the hexagons are identical. The angles at P (right angle + angle between a & c) are identical. The angles at Q (right angle + angle between b & c) are identical. Therefore all four quadrilaterals are identical, and, therefore, the hexagons have the same area. Proof #17 This proof appears in the Book IV of Mathematical Collection by Pappus of Alexandria (ca A.D. 300) [, ]. It generalizes the Pythagorean Theorem in two ways: the triangle ABC is not required to be right-angled and the shapes built on its sides are arbitrary parallelograms instead of squares. Thus build parallelograms CADE and CBFG on sides AC and, respectively, BC. Let DE and FG meet in H and draw AL and BM parallel and equal to HC. Then Area(ABML) = Area(CADE) + Area(CBFG). Indeed, with the sheering transformation already used in proofs #1 and #12, Area(CADE) = Area(CAUH) = Area(SLAR) and also Area(CBFG) = Area(CBVH) = Area(SMBR). Now, just add up what's equal. A dynamic illustration is available . Proof #18 This is another generalization that does not require right angles. It's due to Thâbit ibn Qurra (836-901) []. If angles CAB, AC'B and AB'C are equal then AC² + AB² = BC(CB' + BC'). Indeed, triangles ABC, AC'B and AB'C are similar. Thus we have AB/BC' = BC/AB and AC/CB' = BC/AC which immediately leads to the required identity. In case the angle A is right, the theorem reduces to the Pythagorean proposition and proof #6. The same diagram is exploited in a different way by who concentrates on comparison of BC with the sum CB' + BC'. Proof #19 This proof is a variation on . On the small side AB add a right-angled triangle ABD similar to ABC. Then, naturally, DBC is similar to the other two. From Area(ABD) + Area(ABC) = Area(DBC), AD = AB²/AC and BD = AB·BC/AC we derive (AB²/AC)·AB + AB·AC = (AB·BC/AC)·BC. Dividing by AB/AC leads to AB² + AC² = BC². Proof #20 This one is a cross between and . , as in the diagram. By construction, ΔABC = ΔA'BC. In addition, triangles ABB' and ABC' are also equal. Thus we conclude that Area(A'BC) + Area(AB'C) = Area(ABC'). From the similarity of triangles we get as before B'C = AC²/BC and BC' = AC·AB/BC. Putting it all together yields AC·BC + (AC²/BC)·AC = AB·(AC·AB/BC) which is the same as BC² + AC² = AB². Proof #21 The following is an excerpt from a letter by Dr. Scott Brodie from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY who sent me a couple of proofs of the theorem proper and its generalization to the Law of Cosines: The first proof I merely pass on from the excellent discussion in the Project Mathematics series, based on on quadrilaterals inscribed in a circle: for such quadrilaterals, the sum of the products of the lengths of the opposite sides, taken in pairs equals the product of the lengths of the two diagonals. For the case of a rectangle, this reduces immediately to a² + b² = c². Proof #22 Here is the second proof from Dr. Scott Brodie's letter. We take as known a : If a point is taken exterior to a circle, and from the point a segment is drawn tangent to the circle and another segment (a secant) is drawn which cuts the circle in two distinct points, then the square of the length of the tangent is equal to the product of the distance along the secant from the external point to the nearer point of intersection with the circle and the distance along the secant to the farther point of intersection with the circle. Let ABC be a right triangle, with the right angle at C. Draw the altitude from C to the hypotenuse; let P denote the foot of this altitude. Then since CPB is right, the point P lies on the circle with diameter BC; and since CPA is right, the point P lies on the circle with diameter AC. Therefore the intersection of the two circles on the legs BC, CA of the original right triangle coincides with P, and in particular, lies on AB. Denote by x and y the lengths of segments BP and PA, respectively, and, as usual let a, b, c denote the lengths of the sides of ABC opposite the angles A, B, C respectively. Then, x + y = c. Since angle C is right, BC is tangent to the circle with diameter CA, and the states that a² = xc; similarly, AC is tangent to the circle with diameter BC, and b² = yc. Adding, we find a² + b² = xc + yc = c², Q.E.D. Dr. Brodie also created a file to illustrate this proof. (This proof has been published as number XXIV in a collection of proofs by B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead in Am Math Monthly, v. 4, n. 1 (1897), pp. 11-12.) Proof #23 is based on the Heron's formula. (In passing, with the help of the formula I displayed the areas that illustrates Proof #7). This is a rather convoluted way to prove the Pythagorean Theorem that, nonetheless reflects on the centrality of the Theorem in the geometry of the plane. (A shorter and a more transparent application of Heron's formula is the basis of .) Proof #24 [] ascribes this proof to abu' l'Hasan Thâbit ibn Qurra Marwân al'Harrani (826-901). It's the second of the proofs given by Thâbit ibn Qurra. The first one is essentially the #2 above. The proof resembles part 3 from proof #12. ΔABC = ΔFLC = ΔFMC = ΔBED = ΔAGH = ΔFGE. On one hand, the area of the shape ABDFH equals AC² + BC² + Area(ΔABC + ΔFMC + ΔFLC). On the other hand, Area(ABDFH) = AB² + Area(ΔBED + ΔFGE + ΔAGH). Thâbit ibn Qurra's admits a natural generalization to a . A of ibn Qurra's proof is also available. This is an ""unfolded"" variant of the above proof. Two pentagonal regions - the red and the blue - are obviously equal and leave the same area upon removal of three equal triangles from each. The proof is popularized by , author of the inimitable Gnarly Math CD-ROM. Floor van Lamoen has gracefully pointed me to an earlier source. Eduard Douwes Dekker, one of the most famous Dutch authors, published in 1888 under the pseudonym of Multatuli a proof accompanied by the following diagram. Scott Brodie pointed to the obvious relation of this proof to . It is the same configuration but short of one triangle. Proof #25 B.F.Yanney (1903, []) gave a proof using the ""shearing argument"" also employed in the Proofs #1 and #12. Successively, areas of LMOA, LKCA, and ACDE (which is AC²) are equal as are the areas of HMOB, HKCB, and HKDF (which is BC²). BC = DF. Thus AC² + BC² = Area(LMOA) + Area(HMOB) = Area(ABHL) = AB². Proof #26 This proof I discovered at the where it is presented by a Java applet. With all the above proofs, this one must be simple. Similar triangles like in proofs or . Proof #27 The same pieces as in proof #26 may be rearranged in yet another manner. This dissection is often attributed to the 17th century Dutch mathematician Frans van Schooten. [, p. 35] considers it as a hinged variant of one by ibn Qurra, see the note in parentheses following . Dr. France Dacar from Slovenia has pointed out that this same diagram is easily explained with a tessellation in . As a matter of fact, it may be better explained by a . (I thank Douglas Rogers for setting this straight for me.) The configuration at hand admits numerous variations. B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead (Am Math Monthly, v. 6, n. 2 (1899), 33-34) published several proofs based on the following diagrams (multiple proofs per diagram at that) Proof #28 Melissa Running from has kindly sent me a link (that since disappeared) to a page by Donald B. Wagner, an expert on history of science and technology in China. Dr. Wagner appeared to have reconstructed a proof by Liu Hui (third century AD). However (see below), there are serious doubts to the authorship of the proof. cites this as the geometric proof #28 with the following comment: Benjir von Gutheil, oberlehrer at Nurnberg, Germany, produced the above proof. He died in the trenches in France, 1914. So wrote J. Adams, August 1933. Let us call it the B. von Gutheil World War Proof. Judging by the movie, such forgiving attitude towards a German colleague may not have been common at the time close to the WWI. It might have been even more guarded in the 1930s during the rise to power of the nazis in Germany. (I thank D. Rogers for bringing the reference to to my attention. He also expressed a reservation as regard the attribution of the proof to Liu Hui and traced its early appearance to Karl Julius Walther Lietzmann's Geometrische aufgabensamming Ausgabe B: fuer Realanstalten, published in Leipzig by Teubner in 1916. Interestingly, the proof has not been included in Lietzmann's earlier Der Pythagoreische Lehrsatz published in 1912.) Proof #29 A of the theorem deserves a page of its own. Pertinent to that proof is a page by Scott Brodie Proof #30 This proof I found in R. Nelsen's sequel . (It's due to Poo-sung Park and was originally published in ). Starting with one of the sides of a right triangle, construct 4 congruent right isosceles triangles with hypotenuses of any subsequent two perpendicular and apices away from the given triangle. The hypotenuse of the first of these triangles (in red in the diagram) should coincide with one of the sides. The apices of the isosceles triangles form a square with the side equal to the hypotenuse of the given triangle. The hypotenuses of those triangles cut the sides of the square at their midpoints. So that there appear to be 4 pairs of equal triangles (one of the pairs is in green). One of the triangles in the pair is inside the square, the other is outside. Let the sides of the original triangle be a, b, c (hypotenuse). If the first isosceles triangle was built on side b, then each has area b²/4. We obtain a² + 4b²/4 = c² There's a dynamic and another diagram that shows how to dissect two smaller squares and rearrange them into the big one. This diagram also has a . Proof #31 Given right ΔABC, let, as usual, denote the lengths of sides BC, AC and that of the hypotenuse as a, b, and c, respectively. Erect squares on sides BC and AC as on the diagram. According to , triangles ABC and PCQ are equal, so that ∠QPC = ∠A. Let M be the midpoint of the hypotenuse. Denote the intersection of MC and PQ as R. Let's show that MR PQ. The median to the hypotenuse equals half of the latter. Therefore, ΔCMB is isosceles and ∠MBC = ∠MCB. But we also have ∠PCR = ∠MCB. From here and ∠QPC = ∠A it follows that angle CRP is right, or MR PQ. With these preliminaries we turn to triangles MCP and MCQ. We evaluate their areas in two different ways: One one hand, the altitude from M to PC equals AC/2 = b/2. But also PC = b. Therefore, Area(ΔMCP) = b²/4. On the other hand, Area(ΔMCP) = CM·PR/2 = c·PR/4. Similarly, Area(ΔMCQ) = a²/4 and also Area(ΔMCQ) = CM·RQ/2 = c·RQ/4. We may sum up the two identities: a²/4 + b²/4 = c·PR/4 + c·RQ/4, or a²/4 + b²/4 = c·c/4. (My gratitude goes to who brought this proof to my attention. It appeared in Pythagoras - a dutch math magazine for schoolkids - in the December 1998 issue, in an article by Bruno Ernst. The proof is attributed to an American High School student from 1938 by the name of Ann Condit. The proof is included as the geometric proof 68 in , p. 140.) Proof #32 Let ABC and DEF be two congruent right triangles such that B lies on DE and A, F, C, E are collinear. BC = EF = a, AC = DF = b, AB = DE = c. Obviously, AB DE. Compute the area of ΔADE in two different ways. Area(ΔADE) = AB·DE/2 = c²/2 and also Area(ΔADE) = DF·AE/2 = b·AE/2. AE = AC + CE = b + CE. CE can be found from similar triangles BCE and DFE: CE = BC·FE/DF = a·a/b. Putting things together we obtain c²/2 = b(b + a²/b)/2 (This proof is a simplification of one of the proofs by Michelle Watkins, a student at the University of North Florida, that appeared in Math Spectrum 1997/98, v30, n3, 53-54.) Douglas Rogers observed that the same diagram can be treated differently: Proof 32 can be tidied up a bit further, along the lines of the later proofs added more recently, and so avoiding similar triangles. Of course, ADE is a triangle on base DE with height AB, so of area cc/2. But it can be dissected into the triangle FEB and the quadrilateral ADBF. The former has base FE and height BC, so area aa/2. The latter in turn consists of two triangles back to back on base DF with combined heights AC, so area bb/2. An alternative dissection sees triangle ADE as consisting of triangle ADC and triangle CDE, which, in turn, consists of two triangles back to back on base BC, with combined heights EF. The next two proofs have accompanied the following message from Shai Simonson, Professor at Stonehill College in Cambridge, MA: Greetings, I was enjoying looking through your site, and stumbled on the long list of Pyth Theorem Proofs. In my course ""The History of Mathematical Ingenuity"" I use two proofs that use an inscribed circle in a right triangle. Each proof uses two diagrams, and each is a different geometric view of a single algebraic proof that I discovered many years ago and published in a letter to Mathematics Teacher. The two geometric proofs require no words, but do require a little thought. Best wishes, Shai Proof #33 Proof #34 Proof #35 Cracked Domino - a proof by Mario Pacek (aka Pakoslaw Gwizdalski) - also requires some thought. The proof sent via email was accompanied by the following message: This new, extraordinary and extremely elegant proof of quite probably the most fundamental theorem in mathematics (hands down winner with respect to the # of proofs 367?) is superior to all known to science including the Chinese and James A. Garfield's (20th US president), because it is direct, does not involve any formulas and even preschoolers can get it. Quite probably it is identical to the lost original one - but who can prove that? Not in the Guinness Book of Records yet! The manner in which the pieces are combined may well be original. The dissection itself is well known (see Proofs and ) and is described in book, p. 29. It's remarked there that B. Brodie (1884) observed that the dissection like that also applies to similar rectangles. The dissection is also a particular instance of the superposition proof by . Proof #36 is due to J. E. Böttcher and has been quoted by (Proofs Without Words II, p. 6). I think cracking this proof without words is a good exercise for middle or high school geometry class. S. K. Stein, (, Dover, 1999, p. 74) gives a slightly different dissection. Both variants have a . There is another, especially Proof #37 An applet by David King that demonstrates this proof has been placed on a . Proof #38 This proof was also communicated to me by David King. Squares and 2 triangles combine to produce two hexagon of equal area, which might have been established as in Proof #9. However, both hexagons tessellate the plane. For every hexagon in the left tessellation there is a hexagon in the right tessellation. Both tessellations have the same lattice structure which is . The Pythagorean theorem is proven after two triangles are removed from each of the hexagons. Proof #39 (By J. Barry Sutton, The Math Gazette, v 86, n 505, March 2002, p72.) Let in ΔABC, angle C = 90°. As usual, AB = c, AC = b, BC = a. Define points D and E on AB so that AD = AE = b. By construction, C lies on the circle with center A and radius b. Angle DCE subtends its diameter and thus is right: DCE = 90°. It follows that BCD = ACE. Since ΔACE is isosceles, CEA = ACE. Triangles DBC and EBC share DBC. In addition, BCD = BEC. Therefore, triangles DBC and EBC are similar. We have BC/BE = BD/BC, or a / (c + b) = (c - b) / a. And finally a² = c² - b², a² + b² = c². The diagram reminds one of . But the two are quite different. However, this is exactly proof 14 from . Furthermore, Loomis provides two earlier references from 1925 and 1905. With the circle centered at A drawn, Loomis repeats the proof as 82 (with references from 1887, 1880, 1859, 1792) and also lists (as proof 89) a symmetric version of the above: For the right triangle ABC, with right angle at C, extend AB in both directions so that AE = AC = b and BG = BC = a. As above we now have triangles DBC and EBC similar. In addition, triangles AFC and ACG are also similar, which results in two identities: a² = c² - b², and b² = c² - a². Instead of using either of the identities directly, Loomis adds the two: 2(a² + b²) = 2c², which appears as both graphical and algebraic overkill. Proof #40 This one is by Michael Hardy from University of Toledo and was published in The Mathematical Intelligencer in 1988. It must be taken with a grain of salt. Let ABC be a right triangle with hypotenuse BC. Denote AC = x and BC = y. Then, as C moves along the line AC, x changes and so does y. Assume x changed by a small amount dx. Then y changed by a small amount dy. The triangle CDE may be approximately considered right. Assuming it is, it shares one angle (D) with triangle ABD, and is therefore similar to the latter. This leads to the proportion x/y = dy/dx, or a (separable) differential equation y·dy - x·dx = 0, which after integration gives y² - x² = const. The value of the constant is determined from the initial condition for x = 0. Since y(0) = a, y² = x² + a² for all x. It is easy to take an issue with this proof. What does it mean for a triangle to be approximately right? I can offer the following explanation. Triangles ABC and ABD are right by construction. We have, AB² + AC² = BC² and also AB² + AD² = BD², by the Pythagorean theorem. In terms of x and y, the theorem appears as x² + a² = y² (x + dx)² + a² = (y + dy)² which, after subtraction, gives y·dy - x·dx = (dx² - dy²)/2. For small dx and dy, dx² and dy² are even smaller and might be neglected, leading to the approximate y·dy - x·dx = 0. The trick in Michael's vignette is in skipping the issue of approximation. But can one really justify the derivation without relying on the Pythagorean theorem in the first place? Regardless, I find it very much to my enjoyment to have the ubiquitous equation y·dy - x·dx = 0 placed in that geometric context. An amplified, but apparently independent, version of this proof has been published by Mike Staring (Mathematics Magazine, V. 69, n. 1 (Feb., 1996), 45-46). Assuming Δx > 0 and detecting similar triangles, Δf / Δx = CQ/CD > CP/CD = CA/CB = x/f(x). But also, Δf / Δx = SD/CD < RD/CD = AD/BD = (x + Δx) / (f(x) + Δf) < x/f(x) + Δx/f(x). Passing to the limit as Δx tends to 0+, we get df / dx = x / f(x). The case of Δx < 0 is treated similarly. Now, solving the differential equation we get f 2(x) = x² + c. The constant c is found from the boundary condition f(0) = b: c = b². And the proof is complete. Proof #41 Create 3 scaled copies of the triangle with sides a, b, c by multiplying it by a, b, and c in turn. Put together, the three similar triangles thus obtained to form a rectangle whose upper side is a² + b², whereas the lower side is c². For additional details and modifications see a . Proof #42 The proof is based on the same diagram as [, p. 226-227]. Area of a triangle is obviously rp, where r is the inradius and p = (a + b + c)/2 the semiperimeter of the triangle. From the diagram, the hypothenuse c = (a - r) + (b - r), or r = p - c. The area of the triangle then is computed in two ways: p(p - c) = ab/2, which is equivalent to (a + b + c)(a + b - c) = 2ab, or (a + b)² - c² = 2ab. And finally a² + b² - c² = 0. The proof is due to Jack Oliver, and was originally published in Mathematical Gazette 81 (March 1997), p 117-118. Maciej Maderek informed me that the same proof appeared in a Polish 1988 edition of Sladami Pitagorasa by Szczepan Jelenski: Jelenski attributes the proof to Möllmann without mentioning a source or a date. John F. Rigby made a relevant observation in 1996 (WALMATO Conference, University of Wales, Gergynog, 1996). His notations are clear from the diagram. Computing the area of the triangle in two way gives (r+x)(r+y)=r(2r+2x+2y), which could be simplified to r² + rx + ry = xy which is transformed into (r+x)² + (r+y)² = (x+y)² by adding x² + y² to both sides. Proof #43 By Larry Hoehn [, p. 229, and ]. Apply the to the diagram above where the side a serves as a tangent to a circle of radius b: (c - b)(c + b) = a². The result follows immediately. (The configuration here is essentially the same as in . The invocation of the may be regarded as a shortcut to the argument in . Also, this is exactly proof XVI by B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead, Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 12 (1896), 299-300.) John Molokach suggested a modification based on the following diagram: From the similarity of triangles, a/b = (b + c)/d, so that d = b(b + c)/a. The quadrilateral on the left is a with sides b and d and area 2bd/2 = bd. Adding to this the area of the small triangle (ab/2) we obtain the area of the big triangle - (b + c)d/2: bd + ab/2 = (b + c)d/2 which simplifies to ab/2 = (c - b)d/2, or ab = (c - b)d. Now using the formula for d: ab = (c - b)d = (c - b)(c + b)b/a. Dividing by b and multiplying by a gives a² = c² - b². This variant comes very close to , but with a different motivation. Finally, the argument shows that the area of an bounded by circles of radii b and c > b; is exactly πa² where a² = c² - b². a is a half length of the tangent to the inner circle enclosed within the outer circle. Proof #44 The following proof related to , have been submitted by Adam Rose (Sept. 23, 2004.) Start with two identical right triangles: ABC and AFE, A the intersection of BE and CF. Mark D on AB and G on extension of AF, such that BC = BD = FG (= EF). (For further notations refer to the above diagram.) ΔBCD is isosceles. Therefore, ∠BCD = p/2 - α/2. Since angle C is right, ∠ACD = p/2 - (p/2 - α/2) = α/2. Since ∠AFE is exterior to ΔEFG, ∠AFE = ∠FEG + ∠FGE. But ΔEFG is also isosceles. Thus ∠AGE = ∠FGE = α/2. We now have two lines, CD and EG, crossed by CG with two alternate interior angles, ACD and AGE, equal. Therefore, CD||EG. Triangles ACD and AGE are similar, and AD/AC = AE/AG: b/(c - a) = (c + a)/b, and the Pythagorean theorem follows. Proof #45 This proof is due to Douglas Rogers who came upon it in the course of his investigation into the history of Chinese mathematics. The proof is a variation on , , and . The proof proceeds in two steps. First, as it may be observed from a identity (see also ) a + b = c + d, where d is the diameter of the circle inscribed into a right triangle with sides a and b and hypotenuse c. Based on that and rearranging the pieces in two ways supplies another proof without words of the Pythagorean theorem: Proof #46 This proof is due to Tao Tong (Mathematics Teacher, Feb., 1994, Reader Reflections). I learned of it through the good services of Douglas Rogers who also brought to my attention Proofs , and . In spirit, the proof resembles the . Let ABC and BED be equal right triangles, with E on AB. We are going to evaluate the area of ΔABD in two ways: Area(ΔABD) = BD·AF/2 = DE·AB/2. Using the notations as indicated in the diagram we get c(c - x)/2 = b·b/2. x = CF can be found by noting the similarity (BD AC) of triangles BFC and ABC: x = a²/c. The two formulas easily combine into the Pythagorean identity. Proof #47 This proof which is due to a high school student John Kawamura was report by Chris Davis, his geometry teacher at Head-Rouce School, Oakland, CA (Mathematics Teacher, Apr., 2005, p. 518.) The configuration is virtually identical to that of , but this time we are interested in the area of the quadrilateral ABCD. Both of its perpendicular diagonals have length c, so that its area equals c²/2. On the other hand, c²/2= Area(ABCD) = Area(BCD) + Area(ABD) = a·a/2 + b·b/2 Multiplying by 2 yields the desired result. Proof #48 (W. J. Dobbs, The Mathematical Gazette, 8 (1915-1916), p. 268.) In the diagram, two right triangles - ABC and ADE - are equal and E is located on AB. As in , we evaluate the area of a trapezoid ABCD in two ways: Area(ABCD)= Area(AECD) + Area(BCE) = c·c/2 + a(b - a)/2, where, as in the , c·c is the product of the two perpendicular diagonals of the quadrilateral AECD. On the other hand, Area(ABCD)= AB·(BC + AD)/2 = b(a + b)/2. Combining the two we get c²/2 = a²/2 + b²/2, or, after multiplication by 2, c² = a² + b². Proof #49 In the we may proceed a little differently. Complete a square on sides AB and AD of the two triangles. Its area is, on one hand, b² and, on the other, b²= Area(ABMD) = Area(AECD) + Area(CMD) + Area(BCE) = c²/2 + b(b - a)/2 + a(b - a)/2 = c²/2 + b²/2 - a²/2, which amounts to the same identity as before. Douglas Rogers who observed the relationship between the proofs 46-49 also remarked that a square could have been drawn on the smaller legs of the two triangles if the second triangle is drawn in the ""bottom"" position as in proofs and . In this case, we will again evaluate the area of the quadrilateral ABCD in two ways. With a reference to the second of the diagrams above, c²/2= Area(ABCD) = Area(EBCG) + Area(CDG) + Area(AED) = a² + a(b - a)/2 + b(b - a)/2 = a²/2 + b²/2, as was desired. He also pointed out that it is possible to think of one of the right triangles as sliding from its position in proof to its position in proof so that its short leg glides along the long leg of the other triangle. At any intermediate position there is present a quadrilateral with equal and perpendicular diagonals, so that for all positions it is possible to construct proofs analogous to the above. The triangle always remains inside a square of side b - the length of the long leg of the two triangles. Now, we can also imagine the triangle ABC slide inside that square. Which leads to a proof that directly generalizes and includes configurations of proofs 46-48. See below. Proof #50 The area of the big square KLMN is b². The square is split into 4 triangles and one quadrilateral: b²= Area(KLMN) = Area(AKF) + Area(FLC) + Area(CMD) + Area(DNA) + Area(AFCD) = y(a+x)/2 + (b-a-x)(a+y)/2 + (b-a-y)(b-x)/2 + x(b-y)/2 + c²/2 = [y(a+x) + b(a+y) - y(a+x) - x(b-y) - a·a + (b-a-y)b + x(b-y) + c²]/2 = [b(a+y) - a·a + b·b - (a+y)b + c²]/2 = b²/2 - a²/2 + c²/2. It's not an interesting derivation, but it shows that, when confronted with a task of simplifying algebraic expressions, multiplying through all terms as to remove all parentheses may not be the best strategy. In this case, however, there is even a better strategy that avoids lengthy computations altogether. On Douglas Rogers' suggestion, complete each of the four triangles to an appropriate rectangle: The four rectangles always cut off a square of size a, so that their total area is b² - a². Thus we can finish the proof as in the other proofs of this series: b² = c²/2 + (b² - a²)/2. Proof #51 (W. J. Dobbs, The Mathematical Gazette, 7 (1913-1914), p. 168.) This one comes courtesy of Douglas Rogers from his extensive collection. As in , the triangle is rotated 90 degrees around one of its corners, such that the angle between the hypotenuses in two positions is right. The resulting shape of area b² is then dissected into two right triangles with side lengths (c, c) and (b - a, a + b) and areas c²/2 and (b - a)(a + b)/2 = (b² - a²)/2: b² = c²/2 + (b² - a²)/2. J. Elliott adds a wrinkle to the proof by turning around one of the triangles: Again, the area can be computed in two ways: ab/2 + ab/2 + b(b - a) = c²/2 + (b - a)(b + a)/2, which reduces to b² = c²/2 + (b² - a²)/2, and ultimately to the Pythagorean identity. Proof #52 This proof, discovered by a high school student, Jamie deLemos (The Mathematics Teacher, 88 (1995), p. 79.), has been quoted by Larry Hoehn (The Mathematics Teacher, 90 (1997), pp. 438-441.) On one hand, the area of the trapezoid equals (2a + 2b)/2·(a + b) and on the other, 2a·b/2 + 2b·a/2 + 2·c²/2. Equating the two gives a² + b² = c². The proof is closely related to . Proof #53 Larry Hoehn also published the following proof (The Mathematics Teacher, 88 (1995), p. 168.): Extend the leg AC of the right triangle ABC to D so that AD = AB = c, as in the diagram. At D draw a perpendicular to CD. At A draw a bisector of the angle BAD. Let the two lines meet in E. Finally, let EF be perpendicular to CF. By this construction, triangles ABE and ADE share side AE, have other two sides equal: AD = AB, as well as the angles formed by those sides: ∠BAE = ∠DAE. Therefore, triangles ABE and ADE are congruent by . From here, angle ABE is right. It then follows that in right triangles ABC and BEF angles ABC and EBF add up to 90°. Thus ∠ABC = ∠BEF and ∠BAC = ∠EBF. The two triangles are similar, so that x/a = u/b = y/c. But, EF = CD, or x = b + c, which in combination with the above proportion gives u = b(b + c)/a and y = c(b + c)/a. On the other hand, y = u + a, which leads to c(b + c)/a = b(b + c)/a + a, which is easily simplified to c² = a² + b². Proof #54k Later (The Mathematics Teacher, 90 (1997), pp. 438-441.) Larry Hoehn took a second look at and produced a generic one, or rather a whole 1-parameter family of proofs, which, for various values of the parameter, included as well as . Below I offer a simplified variant inspired by Larry's work. To reproduce the essential point of , i.e. having a right angled triangle ABE and another BEF, the latter being similar to ΔABC, we may simply place ΔBEF with sides ka, kb, kc, for some k, as shown in the diagram. For the diagram to make sense we should restrict k so that ka ≥ b. (This insures that D does not go below A.) Now, the area of the rectangle CDEF can be computed directly as the product of its sides ka and (kb + a), or as the sum of areas of triangles BEF, ABE, ABC, and ADE. Thus we get ka·(kb + a) = ka·kb/2 + kc·c/2 + ab/2 + (kb + a)·(ka - b)/2, which after simplification reduces to a² = c²/2 + a²/2 - b²/2, which is just one step short of the Pythagorean proposition. The proof works for any value of k satisfying k ≥ b/a. In particular, for k = b/a we get . Further, k = (b + c)/a leads to . Of course, we would get the same result by representing the area of the trapezoid AEFB in two ways. For k = 1, this would lead to . Obviously, dealing with a trapezoid is less restrictive and works for any positive value of k. Proof #55 The following generalization of the Pythagorean theorem is due to W. J. Hazard (Am Math Monthly, v 36, n 1, 1929, 32-34). The proof is a slight simplification of the published one. Let parallelogram ABCD inscribed into parallelogram MNPQ is shown on the left. Draw BK||MQ and AS||MN. Let the two intersect in Y. Then Area(ABCD) = Area(QAYK) + Area(BNSY). A reference to shows that this is a true generalization of the Pythagorean theorem. The diagram of is obtained when both parallelograms become squares. The proof proceeds in 4 steps. First, extend the lines as shown below. Then, the first step is to note that parallelograms ABCD and ABFX have equal bases and altitudes, hence equal areas ( In fact, they are .) For the same reason, parallelograms ABFX and YBFW also have equal areas. This is step 2. On step 3 observe that parallelograms SNFW and DTSP have equal areas. (This is because parallelograms DUCP and TENS are equal and . then implies equal areas of parallelograms SNFW and DTSP) Finally, parallelograms DTSP and QAYK are outright equal. (There is a of the proof.) Proof #56 More than a hundred years ago The American Mathematical Monthly published a series of short notes listing great many proofs of the Pythagorean theorem. The authors, B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead, went an extra mile counting and classifying proofs of various flavors. This and the next proof which are numbers V and VI from their collection (Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 4 (1896), 110-113) give a sample of their thoroughness. Based on the diagram below they counted as many as 4864 different proofs. I placed a sample of their work on a . Proof #57 Treating the triangle a little differently, now extending its sides instead of crossing them, B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead came up with essentially the same diagram: Following the method they employed in the previous proof, they again counted 4864 distinct proofs of the Pythagorean proposition. Proof #58 (B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead, Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 6/7 (1896), 169-171, #VII) Let ABC be right angled at C. Produce BC making BD = AB. Join AD. From E, the midpoint of CD, draw a perpendicular meeting AD at F. Join BF. DADC is similar to DBFE. Hence. AC/BE = CD/EF. But CD = BD - BC = AB - BC. Using this BE= BC + CD/2 BE= BC + (AB - BC)/2 = (AB + BC)/2 and EF = AC/2. So that AC·AC/2 = (AB - BC)·(AB + BC)/2, which of course leads to AB² = AC² + BC². (As we've seen in proof , Yanney and Calderhead are fond of exploiting a configuration in as many ways as possible. Concerning the diagram of the present proof, they note that triangles BDF, BFE, and FDE are similar, which allows them to derive a multitude of proportions between various elements of the configuration. They refer to their approach in proof to suggest that here too there are great many proofs based on the same diagram. They leave the actual counting to the reader.) Proof #59 (B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead, Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 12 (1896), 299-300, #XVII) Let ABC be right angled at C and let BC = a be the shortest of the two legs. With C as a center and a as a radius describe a circle. Let D be the intersection of AC with the circle, and H the other one obtained by producing AC beyond C, E the intersection of AB with the circle. Draw CL perpendicular to AB. L is the midpoint of BE. By the theorem, AH·AD = AB·AE. In other words, (b + a)(b - a) = c(c - 2·BL). Now, the right triangles ABC and BCL share an angle at B and are, therefore, similar, wherefrom BL/BC = BC/AB, so that BL = a²/c. Combining all together we see that b² - a² = c(c - 2a²/c) and ultimately the Pythagorean identity. Remark Note that the proof fails for an isosceles right triangle. To accommodate this case, the authors suggest to make use of the usual method of the theory of limits. I am not at all certain what is the ""usual method"" that the authors had in mind. Perhaps, it is best to subject this case to which is simple and does not require the theory of limits. If the case is exceptional anyway, why not to treat it as such. Proof #60 (B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead, Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 12 (1896), 299-300, #XVIII) The idea is the same as before (), but now the circle has the radius b, the length of the longer leg. Having the sides produced as in the diagram, we get AB·BK = BJ·BF, or c·BK = (b - a)(b + a). BK, which is AK - c, can be found from the similarity of triangles ABC and AKH: AK = 2b²/c. Note that, similar to the previous proof, this one, too, does not work in case of the isosceles triangle. Proof #61 (B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead, Am Math Monthly, v.3, n. 12 (1896), 299-300, #XIX) This is a third in the family of proofs that invoke the theorem. The radius of the circle equals now the altitude from the right angle C. Unlike in the other two proofs, there are now no exceptional cases. Referring to the diagram, AD² = AH·AE = b² - CD², BD² = BK·BL = a² - CD², 2AD·BD = 2CD². Adding the three yields the Pythagorean identity. Proof #62 This proof, which is due to Floor van Lamoen, makes use of some of the of the . First of all, it is known that in any triangle ABC the symmedian point K has the barycentric coordinates to the squares of the triangle's side lengths. This implies a relationship between the areas of triangles ABK, BCK and ACK: Area(BCK) : Area(ACK) : Area(ABK) = a² : b² : c². Next, in a right triangle, the symmedian point is the to the hypotenuse. If, therefore, the angle at C is right and CH is the altitude (and also the symmedian) in question, AK serves as a median of ΔACH and BK as a median of ΔBCH. Recollect now that a median cuts a triangle into two of equal areas. Thus, Area(ACK) = Area(AKH) and Area(BCK) = Area(BKH). But Area(ABK)= Area(AKH) + Area(BKH) = Area(ACK) + Area(BCK), so that indeed k·c² = k·a² + k·b², for some k > 0; and the Pythagorean identity follows. Floor also suggested a different approach to exploiting the properties of the symmedian point. Note that the symmedian point is the center of gravity of three weights on A, B and C of magnitudes a², b² and c² respectively. In the right triangle, the foot of the altitude from C is the center of gravity of the weights on B and C. The fact that the symmedian point is the midpoint of this altitude now shows that a² + b² = c². Proof #63 This is another proof by Floor van Lamoen; Floor has been led to the proof via . However, the theorem is not actually needed to carry out the proof. In the figure, M is the center of square ABA'B'. Triangle AB'C' is a rotation of triangle ABC. So we see that B' lies on C'B''. Similarly, A' lies on A''C''. Both AA'' and BB'' equal a + b. Thus the distance from M to A''C'' as well as to B'C' is equal to (a + b)/2. This gives Area(AMB'C')= Area(MAC') + Area(MB'C') = (a + b)/2 · b/2 + (a + b)/2 · a/2 = a²/4 + ab/2 + b²/4. But also: Area(AMB'C')= Area(AMB') + Area(AB'C') = c²/4 + ab/2. This yields a²/4 + b²/4 = c²/4 and the Pythagorean theorem. The basic configuration has been exploited by B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead (Am Math Monthly, v.4, n 10, (1987), 250-251) to produce several proofs based on the following diagrams None of their proofs made use of the centrality of point M. Proof #64 And yet by Floor van Lamoen; in a quintessentially mathematical spirit, this time around Floor reduces the general statement to a particular case, that of a right isosceles triangle. The latter has been treated by and is of the general theorem. FH divides the square ABCD of side a + b into two equal quadrilaterals, ABFH and CDHF. The former consists of two equal triangles with area ab/2, and an isosceles right triangle with area c²/2. The latter is composed of two isosceles right triangles: one of area a²/2, the other b²/2, and a right triangle whose area (by the introductory remark) equals ab! Removing equal areas from the two quadrilaterals, we are left with the identity of areas: a²/2 + b²/2 = c²/2. The idea of Socrates' proof that the area of an isosceles right triangle with hypotenuse k equals k²/4, has been used before, albeit implicitly. For example, (with a reference to the 1778 edition of E. Fourrey's Curiosities Geometrique [Loomis' spelling]) relies on the following diagram: Triangle ABC is right at C, while ABD is right isosceles. (Point D is the midpoint of the semicircle with diameter AB, so that CD is the bisector of the right angle ACB.) AA' and BB' are perpendicular to CD, and AA'CE and BB'CF are squares; in particular EF ⊥ CD. Triangles AA'D and DB'B (having equal hypotenuses and at D) are congruent. It follows that AA' = B'D = A'C = CE = AE. And similar for the segments equal to B'C. Further, CD = B'C + B'D = CF + CE = EF. Area(ADBC)= Area(ADC) + Area(DBC) Area(ADBC)= CD×AA'/2 + CD×BB'/2 Area(ADBC)= CD×EF/2. On the other hand, Area(ABFE)= EF×(AE + BF)/2 Area(ADBC)= CD×AA'/2 + CD×BB'/2 Area(ADBC)= CD×EF/2. Thus the two quadrilateral have the same area and ΔABC as the intersection. Removing ΔABC we see that Area(ADB) = Area(ACE) + Area(BCF). The proof reduces to , as the latter identity is equivalent to c²/4 = a²/4 + b²/4. More recently, Bùi Quang Tuån came up with a different argument: From the above, Area(BA'D) = Area(BB'C) and Area(AA'D) = Area(AB'C). Also, Area(AA'B) = Area(AA'B'), for AA'||BB'. It thus follows that Area(ABD) = Area(AA'C) + Area(BB'C), with the same consequences. Proof #65 This and the following proof are also due to . Both a based on the following lemma, which appears to generalize the Pythagorean theorem: Form squares on the sides of the orthodiagonal quadrilateral. The squares fall into two pairs of opposite squares. Then the sum of the areas of the squares in two pairs are equal. The proof is based on the between a triangle and its : the altitude of a triangle through the right angle extended beyond the vertex is the median of the flank triangle at the right angle. With this in mind, note that the two parallelograms in the left figure not only share the base but also have equal altitudes. Therefore they have equal areas. , we see that the squares at hand split into pairs of rectangles of equal areas, which can be combined in two ways proving the lemma. For the proof now imagine two adjacent vertices of the quadrilateral closing in towards the point of intersection of the diagonals. In the limit, the quadrilateral will become a right triangle and one of the squares shrink to a point. Of the remaining three squares two will add up to the third. Proof #66 (). The lemma from can be used in a different way: Let there be two squares: APBMc and C1McC2Q with a common vertex Mc. Rotation through 90° in the positive direction around Mc moves C1Mc into C2Mc and BMc into AMc. This implies that ΔBMcC1 rotates into ΔAMcC2 so that AC2 and BC1 are orthogonal. Quadrilateral ABC2C1 is thus orthodiagonal and the lemma applies: the red and blue squares add up to the same area. The important point to note is that the sum of the areas of the original squares APBMc and C1McC2Q is half this quantity. Now assume the configurations is such that Mc coincides with the point of intersection of the diagonals. Because of the resulting symmetry, the red squares are equal. Therefore, the areas of APBMc and C1McC2Q add up to that of a red square! (There is a of this argument.) Proof #67 This proof was sent to me by a 14 year old Sina Shiehyan from Sabzevar, Iran. The circumcircle aside, the combination of triangles is exactly the same as in of . However, Brodie's approach if made explicit would require argument different from the one employed by Sina. So, I believe that her derivation well qualifies as an individual proof. From the endpoints of the hypotenuse AB drop perpendiculars AP and BK to the tangent to the circumcircle of ΔABC at point C. Since OC is also perpendicular to the tangent, C is the midpoint of KP. It follows that Area(ACP) + Area(BCK)= CP·AP/2 + CK·BK/2 = [KP·(AP + BK)/2]/2 = Area(ABKP)/2. Therefore, Area(ABC) is also Area(ABKP)/2. So that Area(ACP) + Area(BCK) = Area(ABC) Now all three triangles are similar (as being right and having equal angles), their areas therefore related as the squares of their hypotenuses, which are b, a, and c respectively. And the theorem follows. I have placed the original Sina's derivation on a . Proof #68 The Pythagorean theorem is a direct consequence of the . I am grateful to Floor van Lamoen for bringing to my attention a for . There is a which I love even better. Proof #69 Several proofs that employ practically the same configuration wonderfully exploit distinct tools to achieve the goal. This is a question of what one sees in this diagram. Below are several variants that differ by a view point and, as such, lead to different derivations. I placed some of them in a . Proof #70 Extend the altitude CH to the hypotenuse to D: CD = AB and consider the area of the orthodiagonal quadrilateral ACBD (similar to proofs -.) On one hand, its area equals half the product of its diagonals: c²/2. On the other, it's the sum of areas of two triangles, ACD and BCD. Drop the perpendiculars DE and DF to AC and BC. Rectangle CEDF is has sides equal DE and DF equal to AC and BC, respectively, because for example ΔCDE = ΔABC as both are right, have equal hypotenuse and angles. It follows that Area(CDA) = b² and Area(CDB) = a² so that indeed c²/2 = a²/2 + b²/2. This is proof 20 from . In proof 29, CH is extended upwards to D so that again CD = AB. Again the area of quadrilateral ACBD is evaluated in two ways in exactly same manner. Proof #71 Let D and E be points on the hypotenuse AB such that BD = BC and AE = AC. Let AD = x, DE = y, BE = z. Then AC = x + y, BC = y + z, AB = x + y + z. The Pythagorean theorem is then equivalent to the algebraic identity (y + z)² + (x + y)² = (x + y + z)². Which simplifies to y² = 2xz. To see that the latter is true calculate the A with respect to circle B(C), i.e. the circle centered at B and passing through C, in two ways: first, as the square of the tangent AC and then as the product AD·AL: (x + y)² = x(x + 2(y + z)), which also simplifies to y² = 2xz. This is algebraic proof 101 from . Its dynamic version separately. Proof #72 This is geometric proof #25 from , for which he credits an earlier publication by J. Versluys (1914). The proof is virtually self-explanatory and the addition of a few lines shows a way of making it formal. Michel Lasvergnas came up with an even more ransparent rearrangement (on the right below): These two are obtained from each other by rotating each of the squares 180° around its center. A is also available. Proof #73 This proof is by weininjieda from Yingkou, China who plans to become a teacher of mathematics, Chinese and history. It was included as algebraic proof #50 in , for which he refers to an earlier publication by J. Versluys (1914), where the proof is credited to Cecil Hawkins (1909) of England. Let CE = BC = a, CD = AC = b, F is the intersection of DE and AB. ΔCED = ΔABC, hence DE = AB = c. Since, AC BD and BE AD, ED AB, as the third altitude in ΔABD. Now from Area(ΔABD) = Area(ΔABE) + Area(ΔACD) + Area(ΔBCE) we obtain c(c + EF) = EF·c + b² + a², which implies the Pythagorean identity. Proof #74 The following proof by dissection is due to the 10th century Persian mathematician and astronomer Abul Wafa (Abu'l-Wafa and also Abu al-Wafa) al-Buzjani. Two equal squares are easily combined into a bigger square in a way . However, the smaller square is cut entirely differently. The decomposition of the resulting square is practically the same as that in . A is also available. Proof #75 This an additional application of to proving the Pythagorean theorem. Although it is much shorter than the , I placed it too in a to facilitate the comparison. The idea is simple enough: Heron's formula applies to the isosceles triangle depicted in the diagram below. Proof #76 This is a geometric proof #27 from . According to Loomis, he received the proof in 1933 from J. Adams, The Hague. Loomis makes a remark pointing to the uniqueness of this proof among other dissections in that all the lines are either parallel or perpendicular to the sides of the given triangle. Which is strange as, say, accomplishes they same feat and with fewer lines at that. Even more surprisingly the latter is also included into as the geometric proof #25. Inexplicably Loomis makes a faulty introduction to the construction starting with the wrong division of the hypotenuse. However, it is not difficult to surmise that the point that makes the construction work is the foot of the right angle bisector. A dynamic illustration is available on a . Proof #77 This proof is by the famous Dutch mathematician, astronomer and physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629 - 1695) published in 1657. It was included in as geometric proof #31. As in , the main instrument in the proof is : if a parallelogram and a triangle that share the same base and are in the same parallels , the area of the parallelogram is twice that of the triangle. More specifically, Area(ABML)= 2·Area(ΔABP) = Area(ACFG), and Area(KMLS)= 2·Area(ΔKPS), while Area(BCED)= 2·Area(ΔANB). Combining these with the fact that ΔKPS = ΔANB, we immediately get the Pythagorean proposition. (A dynamic illustration is available on a .) Proof #78 This proof is by the distinguished Dutch mathematician (1930 - 2002). The proof itself is, like , a generalization of and is based on the same diagram. Both proofs reduce to a of Euclid VI.31 for right triangles (with the right angle at C). The proof aside, Dijkstra also found a remarkably fresh viewpoint on the essence of the theorem itself: If, in a triangle, angles α, β, γ lie opposite the sides of length a, b, c, then sign(α + β - γ) = sign(a² + b² - c²), where sign(t) is the function. As in , Dijkstra forms two triangles ACL and BCN similar to the base ΔABC: BCN = CAB and ACL = CBA so that ACB = ALC = BNC. The details and a dynamic illustration are found in a . Proof #79 There are several proofs on this page that make use of the , notably proofs ##, , and , where the circle to whose chords the theorem applied had the radius equal to the short leg of ΔABC, the long leg and the altitude from the right angle, respectively. lists these among its collection of algebraic proofs along with several others that derive the Pythagorean theorem by means of the Intersecting Chords theorem applied to chords in a fanciful variety of circles added to ΔABC. Alexandre Wajnberg from Unité de Recherches sur l'Enseignement des Mathématiques, Université Libre de Bruxelles came up with a variant that appears to fill an omission in this series of proofs. The construction also looks simpler and more natural than any listed by Loomis. What a surprise! For the details, see a . Proof #80 A proof based on the diagram below has been published in a letter to Mathematics Teacher (v. 87, n. 1, January 1994) by J. Grossman. The proof has been discovered by a pupil of his David Houston, an eighth grader at the time. I am grateful to Professor Grossman for bringing the proof to my attention. The proof and a discussion appear in a , but its essence is as follows. Assume two copies of the right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c are placed back to back as shown in the left diagram. The isosceles triangle so formed S = c² sin(θ) / 2. In the right diagram, two copies of the same triangle are joined at the right angle and embedded into a rectangle with one side equal c. Each of the triangles has the area equal to half the area of half the rectangle, implying that the areas of the remaining isosceles triangles also add up to half the area of the rectangle, i.e., the area of the isosceles triangle in the left diagram. The sum of the areas of the two smaller isosceles triangles equals S= a² sin(π - θ) / 2 + b² sin(θ) / 2 = (a² + b²) sin(θ) / 2, for, sin(π - θ) = sin(θ). Since the two areas are equal and sin(θ) ≠ 0, for a non-degenerate triangle, a² + b² = c². Is this a trigonometric proof? Luc Gheysens from Flanders (Belgium) came up with a modification based on the following diagram The complete discussion can be found on a . Proof #81 Philip Voets, an 18 years old law student from Holland sent me a proof he found a few years earlier. The proof is a combination of shearing employed in a number of other proofs and the decomposition of a right triangle by the altitude from the right angle into two similar pieces also used several times before. However, the accompanying diagram does not appear among the many in . Given ΔABC with the right angle at A, construct a square BCHI and shear it into the parallelogram BCJK, with K on the extension of AB. Add IL perpendicular to AK. By the construction, Area(BCJK) = Area(BCHI) = c². On the other hand, the area of the parallelogram BCJK equals the product of the base BK and the altitude CA. In the right triangles BIK and BIL, BI = BC = c and ∠IBL = ∠ACB = β, making the two respectively similar and equal to ΔABC. ΔIKL is then also similar to ΔABC, and we find BL = b and LK = a²/b. So that Area(BCJK)= BK × CA = (b + a²/b) × b = b² + a². We see that c² = Area(BCJK) = a² + b² completing the proof. Proof #82 This proof has been published in the American Mathematical Monthly (v. 116, n. 8, 2009, October 2009, p. 687), with an Editor's note: Although this proof does not appear to be widely known, it is a rediscovery of a proof that first appeared in print in [, pp. 26-27]. The proof has been submitted by Sang Woo Ryoo, student, Carlisle High School, Carlisle, PA. Loomis takes credit for the proof, although Monthly's editor traces its origin to a 1896 paper by B. F. Yanney and J. A. Calderhead (Monthly, v. 3, p. 65-67.) Draw AD, the angle bisector of angle A, and DE perpendicular to AB. Let, as usual, AB = c, BC = a, and AC = b. Let CD = DE = x. Then BD = a - x and BE = c - b. Triangles ABC and DBE are similar, leading to x/(a - x) = b/c, or x = ab/(b + c). But also (c - b)/x = a/b, implying c - b = ax/b = a²/(b + c). Which leads to (c - b)(c + b) = a² and the Pythagorean identity. Proof #83 This proof is a slight modification of the sent to me by Jan Stevens from Chalmers University of Technology and Göteborg University. The proof is actually of and is based on the extension of the construction in . α + β > γ a² + b² > c². The details can be found on a . Proof #84 Elisha Loomis, myself and no doubt many others believed and still believe that no trigonometric proof of the Pythagorean theorem is possible. This belief stemmed from the assumption that any such proof would rely on the most fundamental of trigonometric identities sin²α + cos²α = 1 is nothing but a reformulation of the Pythagorean theorem proper. Now, that the theorem can be derived from the for sine and cosine without a recourse to sin²α + cos²α = 1. I happily admit to being in the wrong.

0,study,Pythagorean theorem - Encyclopedia of Mathematics,https://study.com/learn/lesson/pythagorean-theorem-overview-formula-examples.html,"Pythagorean theorem, or Pythagoras' theorem, states that the sum of the squares of the two legs of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the square of the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and is always opposite the right angle. This theorem is used in determining the length of the sides of a right triangle. The formula for the Pythagorean theorem is {eq}a^2 + b^2 = c^2 {/eq}, where a and b are the legs and c is the hypotenuse.Pythagoras was a fifth century BCE Greek philosopher and mathematician who is credited with several scientific and mathematical discoveries, most notably the Pythagorean theorem. Although the Pythagorean theorem was popularized by Pythagoras, other ancient mathematicians in ancient civilizations such as Babylon and China had previously formulated the idea. Pythagoras was the first to prove its validity for all right triangles. Pythagorean Theorem: Overview, Formula, & Examples An error occurred trying to load this video.

To prove the theorem algebraically, begin with a diagram of a tilted square inside another square. The inner tilted square forms four right triangles By tilting the inner square so that its corners touch the sides of the outer square, four congruent right triangles are formed, each with sides a and b and a hypotenuse c. The sides of the larger square are equal to a + b, and the sides of the inner square are equal to c. The area of the larger square can be determined in two ways: {eq}A = (a + b)^2 {/eq} OR the sum of the areas of the four triangles and the inner square. Since both methods produce the same result, the two methods are equal. So, mathematically,{eq}(a + b)^2 = 4(ab/2) + c^2\\\ a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 2ab + c^2\\\ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 {/eq}Another way to prove Pythagoras' theorem is by using the similar triangle method. Start by constructing a right triangle. Then, from the vertex of the right angle, draw a line perpendicular to the hypotenuse, as indicated in the diagram. Perpendicular bisector from angle B to a point (D) on the hypotenuse For triangles ABC and ADB: angle A = angle A common angle angle ADB = angle ABC right angles triangle ADB is similar to triangle ABC angle-angle similarity For triangles BDC and ABC: angle C = angle C common angle angle CDB = angle CBA right angles triangle BDC is similar to triangle ABC angle-angle similarity Thus, all three triangles are similar, so their sides are proportionate. AB/AC = AD/AB, so AB2 = AD ⋅ AC cross multiplication BC/AC = CD/BC, so BC2 = CD ⋅ AC cross multiplication AB2 + BC2 = (AD ⋅ AC) + (CD ⋅ AC) add both equations together AB2 + BC2 = AC(AD + CD) factoring AB2 + BC2 = AC(AC) substitution AB2 + BC2 = AC2 multiplication Pythagoras' theorem is proven!Another mathematician, Euclid, proved the theorem in yet another way by constructing squares from each of the sides of the right triangle. Euclid's method is often referred to as the Windmill proof because its shape resembles that of a windmill. Using the Pythagorean Theorem FormulaSince the Pythagorean theorem has been proven valid by many different methods, the formula {eq}a^2 + b^2 = c^2 {/eq} can be reliably used to find the missing side length of a right triangle. The length of a hypotenuse can be calculated using the formula when the other two side lengths are given, or the length of one leg can be calculated if only a leg length and hypotenuse are given. For example, use Pythagoras' formula to find the hypotenuse when the lengths of the other two sides are 3 and 4. To find the hypotenuse, substitute 3 and 4 for a and b, then solve for c.{eq}3^2 + 4^2 = c^2\\\ 9 + 16 = c^2\\\ 25 = c^2\\\ 5 = c {/eq}Note: When practicing how to do the Pythagorean theorem, be sure to square the a and b terms before adding them together. Some geometry problems require determining which type of triangle is present. For these types of problems, the converse of Pythagoras' theorem will be helpful. The converse of the Pythagorean theorem states that if the sum of the squares of the shorter two legs of a triangle equal the square of the longer side, then the triangle is a right triangle.A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers that satisfy the Pythagorean formula. The smallest Pythagorean triple is 3-4-5 as {eq}3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 {/eq}, and another example is because {eq}5^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 {/eq}. A Pythagorean square is a tool that may be helpful when using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean square is a multiplication table in the shape of a square, where the perfect squares are on the diagonal from top left to bottom right. This tool may be helpful in quickly determining the squares of numbers. A color-coded Pythagorean square Pythagorean"

There are also Pythagoras theorem worksheets based on Edexcel, AQA and OCR exam questions, along with further guidance on where to go next if you’re still stuck. What is Pythagoras theorem? Pythagoras theorem states that the square of the longest side of a right angled triangle (called the hypotenuse) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Pythagoras theorem is: \[a^2+b^2=c^2\] Side c c c is known as the hypotenuse, which is the longest side of a right-angled triangle and is opposite the right angle. Side a a a and side b b b are known as the adjacent sides because they are adjacent (next to) the right angle. If we know any two sides of a right angled triangle, we can use Pythagoras theorem to work out the length of the third side. We can only use Pythagoras theorem with right-angled triangles. E.g.Let’s look at this right-angled triangle: We can see that three squares have been drawn next to each of the sides of the triangle.The area of the square with side length 3=3×3=32=9 3 = 3 \times 3=3^2=9 3=3×3=32=9The area of the square with side length 4=4×4=42=16 4 = 4\times 4=4^2=16 4=4×4=42=16The area of the square with side length 5=5×5=52=25 5 = 5\times5=5^2=25 5=5×5=52=25 We can see that when we add together the areas of the squares on the two shorter sides we get the area of the square on the longest side. \[9+16=25\] We can see that when we square the lengths of the two shorter sides of a right angled triangle and add them together, we get the square of the longest side. \[3^2+4^2=5^2\] 3,4,5 3, 4, 5 3,4,5 is known as a Pythagorean triple. There are other Pythagorean triples such as 5,12,13 5, 12, 13 5,12,13 and 8,15,17 8, 15, 17 8,15,17. See also: What is Pythagoras theorem?

Work out the answer.Show step Pythagoras theorem only works with right-angled triangles.So because, \[6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2\] The sides of the triangles fit with Pythagoras theorem. Therefore the triangle is a right-angled triangle. Common misconceptions Make sure you identify the hypotenuse It is very important to make sure that the hypotenuse is correctly identified and labelled c c c. You can find the hypotenuse by identifying the side which is opposite the right angle. Right-angled triangles may be in different orientations The triangles can be drawn in different orientations. E.g. Lengths of sides do not have to be whole numbers Lengths can be decimals, fractions or even irrational numbers such as surds, E.g. 2 \sqrt{2} 2​. Right-angled triangles Pythagoras theorem only works on right-angle triangles, however we can sometimes calculate the lengths of other triangles by splitting them into right angled triangles.E.g.An isosceles triangle can be made into 2 2 2 right-angled triangles by putting in the line of symmetry. Pythagoras theorem can also be applied to other shapes An application of Pythagoras theorem is to extend it to work on other shapes such as a trapezium. Do not round too early If you need to use Pythagoras theorem in a question with multiple steps, do not round until the very end of the question or you will lose accuracy. For example, you may need to find the height of a triangle, and then use that height to find its area. Practice Pythagoras theorem questions 1. Find side x. x. x.

This relationship is represented by the formula: In the box above, you may have noticed the word “square,” as well as the small 2s to the top right of the letters in . To square a number means to multiply it by itself. So, for example, to square the number 5 you multiply 5 • 5, and to square the number 12, you multiply 12 • 12. Some common squares are shown in the table below. Number Number Times Itself Square 1 12 = 1 • 1 1 2 22 = 2 • 2 4 3 32 = 3 • 3 9 4 42 = 4 • 4 16 5 52 = 5 • 5 25 10 102 = 10 • 10 100 When you see the equation , you can think of this as “the length of side a times itself, plus the length of side b times itself is the same as the length of side c times itself.” Let’s try out all of the Pythagorean Theorem with an actual right triangle. This theorem holds true for this right triangle—the sum of the squares of the lengths of both legs is the same as the square of the length of the hypotenuse. And, in fact, it holds true for all right triangles. The Pythagorean Theorem can also be represented in terms of area. In any right triangle, the area of the square drawn from the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares that are drawn from the two legs. You can see this illustrated below in the same 3-4-5 right triangle. Note that the Pythagorean Theorem only works with right triangles. Finding the Length of the Hypotenuse You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle if you know the length of the triangle’s other two sides, called the legs. Put another way, if you know the lengths of a and b, you can find c. In the triangle above, you are given measures for legs a and b: 5 and 12, respectively. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a value for the length of c, the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem. Substitute known values for a and b. Evaluate. Simplify. To find the value of c, think about a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 169. Does 10 work? How about 11? 12? 13? (You can use a calculator to multiply if the numbers are unfamiliar.) 13 = c The square root of 169 is 13. Using the formula, you find that the length of c, the hypotenuse, is 13. In this case, you did not know the value of c—you were given the square of the length of the hypotenuse, and had to figure it out from there. When you are given an equation like and are asked to find the value of c, this is called finding the square root of a number. (Notice you found a number, c, whose square was 169.) Finding a square root takes some practice, but it also takes knowledge of multiplication, division, and a little bit of trial and error. Look at the table below. Number x Number y which, when multiplied by itself, equals number x Square root y 1 1 • 1 1 4 2 • 2 2 9 3 • 3 3 16 4 • 4 4 25 5 • 5 5 100 10 • 10 10 It is a good habit to become familiar with the squares of the numbers from 0‒10, as these arise frequently in mathematics. If you can remember those square numbers—or if you can use a calculator to find them—then finding many common square roots will be just a matter of recall. For which of these triangles is ? A) B) C) D) A) Incorrect. This is not a right triangle, so you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to find r. The correct answer is Triangle B. B) Correct. This is a right triangle; when you sum the squares of the lengths of the sides, you get the square of the length of the hypotenuse. C) Incorrect. This is not a right triangle, so you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to find r. The correct answer is Triangle B. D) Incorrect. This is not a right triangle, so you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to find r. The correct answer is Triangle B. Finding the Length of a Leg You can use the same formula to find the length of a right triangle’s leg if you are given measurements for the lengths of the hypotenuse and the other leg. Consider the example below. Example Problem Find the length of side a in the triangle below. Use a calculator to estimate the square root to one decimal place. a = ? b = 6 c = 7 In this right triangle, you are given the measurements for the hypotenuse, c, and one leg, b. The hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle and it is always the longest side of the triangle. To find the length of leg a, substitute the known values into the Pythagorean"
0,tasks.illustrativemathematics,Pythagorean theorem - Encyclopedia of Mathematics,https://tasks.illustrativemathematics.org/content-standards/tasks/724,"Pythagorean Theorem is true. IM Commentary The converse of the Pythagorean Theorem says that if a triangle has sides of length , , and and if then the angle opposite the side of length is a right angle. This is less well known than the Pythagorean Theorem and provides a chance both to emphasize the difference between the Pythagorean Theorem and its converse while also providing an opportunity for experimentation. The application to constructing right angles is a real one and an important one as protractors are not always convenient to use and not very accurate. This task is for instruction purposes. Part (b) is subtle and the solution presented here uses a ""dynamic"" view of triangles with two side lengths fixed. This helps pave the way toward what students will see later in trigonometry but some guidance will likely be needed in order to get students started on this path. Further information about how this construction of a right angle was implemented in different cultures can be found at the following web links: Solution The Pythagorean Theorem states that in a right triangle with side lengths , with being the length of the hypotenuse (that is, the side opposite the right angle), the relationship a^2 + b^2 = c^2 always holds. The converse of the Pythagorean Theorem says that if are side lengths of a triangle that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = c^2 then the angle opposite the side of length is a right angle. The ancient cultures are trying to conclude that an angle is a right angle based on the side lengths of a triangle. Looking at part (a), it is the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem which has as its conclusion that an angle is a right angle so they are using the converse of the Pythagorean Theorem.

This theorem is central to the computation of distances on a plane or in three-dimensional space, which are explored in the next module. In this module you will explore several proofs of this theorem, explaining to yourself why it is true. Proof Using Similar Triangles Step 1: Draw a right triangle, and label the vertices A, B, and C, where C is the vertex of the right angle. Let a denote the length of AC, b denote the length of BC, and c denote the length of AB. Step 2: Draw a line through vertex C that is perpendicular to the segment AB. Label the point of intersection D. Let d denote the length of CD. Questions: How many similar triangles are in your drawing? How do you know they are similar? What is the ratio a/c equal to? What is the ratio b/c equal to? Can you get an expression for a2? For b2? Conclusion: You should now be able to obtain the equation: a2 + b2 = c2 So you've proved the theorem! A More Geometric Proof The last proof of the theorem left some things to be desired. Although it is a perfectly good proof, the final steps are shrouded in lots of algebra. One would hope that for a proof of a geometric identity, the crucial steps would rely more strongly on geometry. This proof will give you a more geometric way of thinking about the theorem. You will need two sheets of different colored construction paper, scissors, paste, and a ruler to complete the following exercise. Step 1: Choose lengths for the variables a and b. Only use these lengths to measure things for drawing and cutting throughout the exercise. Answer all questions in terms of the variables. Step 2: Cut a square of side lengths a+b out of one color of paper. Step 3: Mark the point length a up the left side of the square, the point length a along the top of the square, the point length b along the bottom of the square, and the point length b up the right side of the square. Step 4: Connect your marked points as in the following diagram, so that you have drawn four right triangles with leg lengths a and b. Label the hypotenuse of each triangle c, and fill in the missing labels for the remaining sides. Note that not all the leg lengths are labeled in the diagram. Questions: What are the interior angles of the quadrilateral enclosed by the triangles you have drawn? Would this be true for any values of a and b that you picked? Why or why not? What is the area of the enclosed quadrilateral? What is the area not covered by triangles in the original square? Step 5:Trace your square of side lengths a+b onto the other colored sheet of paper. Step 6: Cut the four triangles from your original square. Paste the leftmost two into their original positions on the second square, as in the image below. Step 7: Paste the remaining two triangles as in the diagram below. Label all the side lengths that you know. Questions: What is the area of the space not covered by triangles in terms of just a and b? (Hint: It may help to subdivide the space, and find the area of each portion separately.) Based on your earlier results in this exercise, what other value is this empty space equal to? Conclusion: You should now be able to obtain the equation: a2 + b2 = c2 So you've proved the theorem!

A right triangle consists of two legs and a hypotenuse. The two legs meet at a 90° angle and the hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle and is the side opposite the right angle. The Pythagorean Theorem tells us that the relationship in every right triangle is: a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2} Example C^{2}=6^{2}+4^{2} C^{2}=36+16 C^{2}=52 C=\sqrt{52} C\approx 7.2 There are a couple of special types of right triangles, like the 45°-45° right triangles and the 30°-60° right triangle. Because of their angles it is easier to find the hypotenuse or the legs in these right triangles than in all other right triangles. In a 45°-45° right triangle we only need to multiply one leg by √2 to get the length of the hypotenuse. Example We multiply the length of the leg which is 7 inches by √2 to get the length of the hypotenuse. 7\cdot \sqrt{2}\approx 9.9 In a 30°-60° right triangle we can find the length of the leg that is opposite the 30° angle by using this formula: a=\frac{1}{2}\cdot c Example To find a, we use the formula above. a=\frac{1}{2}\cdot 14 a=7 Video lesson Find the sides of this right triangle More classes on this subject Next Chapter: Math Playground Pre-Algebra Introducing Algebra Explore and understand integers Inequalities and one-step equations Discover fractions and factors More about the four rules of arithmetic More about equation and inequalities Graphing and functions Ratios and percent Probability and statistics Introducing geometry Area and Volume Right triangles and algebra Algebra 1 Algebra 2 Geometry SAT ACT Mathplanet is licensed by ."

The two legs, aa and bb, are opposite ∠A and ∠B. ∠C is a right angle, 90°, and ∠A + ∠B = 90° (complementary).The three sides always maintain a relationship such that the sum of the squares of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In mathematics terms it looks like this:a2+b2=c2{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}={c}^{2}a2+b2=c2Pythagorean Theorem FormulaHow to use the Pythagorean theoremThe Pythagorean Theorem can be used to find the length of the hypotenuse if you know the lengths of legs a and b.Solve for cSuppose you have leg a=5 centimeters and b=12 centimeters:Pythagorean Theorem - Solve For cPythagorean theorem steps explainedWe start with our formula a2+b2=c2{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}={c}^{2}a2+b2=c2, then we plug in the length of each leg:52+122=c2{5}^{2}+{12}^{2}={c}^{2}52+122=c2Next, multiply each number times itself:25+144=c225+144={c}^{2}25+144=c2Then we add:169=c2169={c}^{2}169=c2Now, we take the square root of both sides:169=c2\sqrt{169}=\sqrt{{c}^{2}}169​=c2​So you take the principal root of both sides and you get:13=c13=c13=cSolve for a or bYou can know the length of the hypotenuse and one leg and still use the Pythagorean Theorem. Suppose you know c=40 feet and short leg a=24 feet.Pythagorean Theorem - Solve for bStep by stepFirst, plug what you know into our formula:242+b2=402{24}^{2}+{b}^{2}={40}^{2}242+b2=402Multiply each number times itself, then add:576+b2=1,600576+{b}^{2}=1,600576+b2=1,600Then, you need to subtract the a2{a}^{2}a2 length from both sides, to isolate b2{b}^{2}b2:(576−576)+b2=(1600−576)(576-576)+{b}^{2}=(1600-576)(576−576)+b2=(1600−576)On the left handed side we're left with just b2{b}^{2}b2:b2=1,024{b}^{2}=1,024b2=1,024Now take the square root of both sides:b2=1024\sqrt{{b}^{2}}=\sqrt{1024}b2​=1024​Take the principal root of both sides and you get:b=32b=32b=32You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for any length if you know the lengths of two other sides.Checking your answerSo our right triangle had legs a=24, b=32, and hypotenuse c=40.

0,wikihow,Pythagorean theorem - Encyclopedia of Mathematics,https://www.wikihow.com/Use-the-Pythagorean-Theorem,"Pythagorean Theorem allows mathematicians to find the length of any one of a right triangle's sides as long as they know the lengths of the other two sides. Determine which of your sides has an unknown length - a, b, and/or c. If the length of only one of your sides is unknown, you're ready to proceed. X Research source Let's say, for example, that we know that our hypotenuse has a length of 5 and one of the other sides has a length of 3, but we're not sure what the length of the third side is. In this case, we know we're solving for the length of the third side, and, because we know the lengths of the other two, we're ready to go! We'll return to this example problem in the following steps. If the lengths of two of your sides are unknown, you'll need to determine the length of one more side to use the Pythagorean Theorem. can help you here if you know one of the non-right angles in the triangle. 4 Plug your two known values into the equation. Insert your values for the lengths of the sides of your triangle into the equation a2 + b2 = c2. Remember that a and b are the non hypotenuse sides, while c is the hypotenuse. X Research source In our example, we know the length of one side and the hypotenuse (3 & 5), so we would write our equation as 3² + b² = 5² 5 Calculate the squares. To solve your equation, begin by taking the square of each of your known sides. Alternatively, if you find it easier, you may leave your side lengths in the exponent form, then square them later. X Research source In our example, we would square 3 and 5 to get 9 and 25, respectively. We can rewrite our equation as 9 + b² = 25. 6 Isolate your unknown variable on one side of the equals sign. If necessary, use basic algebra operations to get your unknown variable on one side of the equals sign and your two squares on the other side of the equals sign. If you're solving for the hypotenuse, c will already be isolated, so you won't need to do anything to isolate it. X Research source In our example, our current equation is 9 + b² = 25. To isolate b², let's subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. This leaves us with b² = 16. 7 Take the square root of both sides of the equation. You should now be left with one variable squared on one side of the equation and a number on the other side. Simply take the square root of both sides to find the length of your unknown side. X Research source In our example, b² = 16, taking the square root of both sides gives us b = 4. Thus, we can say that the length of the unknown side of our triangle is 4. 8 Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the sides of real-world right triangles. The reason that the Pythagorean Theorem is so widely used today is that it's applicable in countless practical situations. Learn to recognize right triangles in real life - in any situation where two straight objects or lines meet at a right angle and a third line or object stretches diagonally across from the right angle, you can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of one of the sides, given the length of the other two. X Research source Let's try real-world example that's a little more difficult. A ladder is leaning against a building. The base of the ladder is 5 meters (16.4 ft) from the bottom of the wall. The ladder reaches 20 meters (65.6 ft) up the wall of the building. How long is the ladder? ""5 meters (16.4 ft) from the bottom of wall” and ""20 meters (65.6 ft) up the wall” clue us into the lengths of the sides of our triangle. Since the wall and the ground (presumably) meet at a right angle and the ladder leans diagonally against the wall, we can think of this arrangement as a right triangle with sides of length a = 5 and b = 20. The length of the ladder is the hypotenuse, so c is our unknown. Let's use the Pythagorean Theorem: a² + b² = c² (5)² + (20)² = c² 25 + 400 = c² 425 = c² sqrt(425) = c c = 20.6 . The approximate length of the ladder is 20.6 meters (67.6 ft). Advertisement Method 2 Method 2 of 2: Calculating the Distance Between Two Points in an X-Y Plane 1 Define two points in the X-Y plane.

This relationship is represented by the formula: In the box above, you may have noticed the word “square,” as well as the small 2s to the top right of the letters in . To square a number means to multiply it by itself. So, for example, to square the number 5 you multiply 5 • 5, and to square the number 12, you multiply 12 • 12. Some common squares are shown in the table below. Number Number Times Itself Square 1 12 = 1 • 1 1 2 22 = 2 • 2 4 3 32 = 3 • 3 9 4 42 = 4 • 4 16 5 52 = 5 • 5 25 10 102 = 10 • 10 100 When you see the equation , you can think of this as “the length of side a times itself, plus the length of side b times itself is the same as the length of side c times itself.” Let’s try out all of the Pythagorean Theorem with an actual right triangle. This theorem holds true for this right triangle—the sum of the squares of the lengths of both legs is the same as the square of the length of the hypotenuse. And, in fact, it holds true for all right triangles. The Pythagorean Theorem can also be represented in terms of area. In any right triangle, the area of the square drawn from the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares that are drawn from the two legs. You can see this illustrated below in the same 3-4-5 right triangle. Note that the Pythagorean Theorem only works with right triangles. Finding the Length of the Hypotenuse You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle if you know the length of the triangle’s other two sides, called the legs. Put another way, if you know the lengths of a and b, you can find c. In the triangle above, you are given measures for legs a and b: 5 and 12, respectively. You can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find a value for the length of c, the hypotenuse. The Pythagorean Theorem. Substitute known values for a and b. Evaluate. Simplify. To find the value of c, think about a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 169. Does 10 work? How about 11? 12? 13? (You can use a calculator to multiply if the numbers are unfamiliar.) 13 = c The square root of 169 is 13. Using the formula, you find that the length of c, the hypotenuse, is 13. In this case, you did not know the value of c—you were given the square of the length of the hypotenuse, and had to figure it out from there. When you are given an equation like and are asked to find the value of c, this is called finding the square root of a number. (Notice you found a number, c, whose square was 169.) Finding a square root takes some practice, but it also takes knowledge of multiplication, division, and a little bit of trial and error. Look at the table below. Number x Number y which, when multiplied by itself, equals number x Square root y 1 1 • 1 1 4 2 • 2 2 9 3 • 3 3 16 4 • 4 4 25 5 • 5 5 100 10 • 10 10 It is a good habit to become familiar with the squares of the numbers from 0‒10, as these arise frequently in mathematics. If you can remember those square numbers—or if you can use a calculator to find them—then finding many common square roots will be just a matter of recall. For which of these triangles is ? A) B) C) D) A) Incorrect. This is not a right triangle, so you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to find r. The correct answer is Triangle B. B) Correct. This is a right triangle; when you sum the squares of the lengths of the sides, you get the square of the length of the hypotenuse. C) Incorrect. This is not a right triangle, so you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to find r. The correct answer is Triangle B. D) Incorrect. This is not a right triangle, so you cannot use the Pythagorean Theorem to find r. The correct answer is Triangle B. Finding the Length of a Leg You can use the same formula to find the length of a right triangle’s leg if you are given measurements for the lengths of the hypotenuse and the other leg. Consider the example below. Example Problem Find the length of side a in the triangle below. Use a calculator to estimate the square root to one decimal place. a = ? b = 6 c = 7 In this right triangle, you are given the measurements for the hypotenuse, c, and one leg, b. The hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle and it is always the longest side of the triangle. To find the length of leg a, substitute the known values into the Pythagorean"

The rule states that #a^2 + b^2 = c^2# , in which #a# and #b# are the opposite and the adjacent sides, the 2 sides which make the right-angle, and #c# representing the hypotenuse, the longest side of the triangle. So if you have #a = 6# and #b = 8#, #c# would equal to #(6^2 + 8^2)^(1/2)#, (#x^(1/2)# meaning square rooted), which is equal to 10, #c#, the hypotenuse.http://ncalculators.com/number-conversion/pythagoras-theorem.htm Aug 24, 2017 Trust me, it's a very helpful topic in Geometry and you can learn more about it down below! Explanation: The Pythagorean Thereom (found by aka Pythagoras of Samos) is used to find the length of a side of a right triangle using the formula #a^2+b^2=c^2#! A right triangle has two ""legs"" and a hypotenuse. A hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle and is always the opposite of the right angle corner. The legs can be a or b (it doesn't matter which is #a# or which is #b#). The #c# is always longer than #a# and #b#! To get some more clarity, take a look at the example down below! https://autodo.info/pages/p/pythagorean-theorem-problems-hypotenuse/ In this case, lets say that #a# is #3#, #b# is #4# and #c# is #x#. #a^2+b^2=c^2# After substituting... #3^2+4^2=x^2# After simplifying... #9+16=x^2# Now, solve it! #x^2=25# Whoa, whoa, wait a second before you finalize that as the answer! We can simplify this. It's just not #x#, it's #x^2#! So we have to find the square root of #25# so that you can get your final answer! The square root of #25# is #5#. So... #x=5#! Remember, we don't use the just for the hypotenuse! We can use it for the other sides, too! Ex: http://www.myghillie.info/lsitpkey-pythagorean-theorem-formula-cute.shtml In this problem, we know the hypotenuse, but we need to find out what one of the ""legs"" is. Lets say that #6# is #a#, #x# is #b# and we know that #10# has to be #c#. #a^2+b^2=c^2# After substituting... #6^2+x^2=10^2# After simplifying... #36+x^2=100# Leave #x^2# on one side... #x^2=100-36# #x^2=64# #x=8# There! We have it! I hope you have a better clarity of the Pythagorean Thereom and understand it! My source (despite the images) is my mind! Sorry if my answer is too long!

Find the length of a side of a right-angled triangle. The Pythagoras’ theorem relates to the lengths of the three sides of a right-angled triangle. The Pythagoras’ theorem states that the square on the longest side of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the two shorter sides of the triangle. The Pythagoras’ theorem can be used to find the length of the third side of the right-angled triangle if the lengths of the other two sides are provided. The Pythagoras’ theorem can also be used to determine whether a triangle has a right angle (90°). Formula The square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. BC2 = AB2 +AC2 Example 1 Given one side and the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle as 5.6cm and 12.3cm respectively, find the length of the other side. 5.62 + x2 = 12.32 31.36 + x2 = 151.29 x2 = 119.93 x = 10.95cm Example 2 Given two sides of a right-angled triangle as 5cm and 7cm, find the length of the hypotenuse. x2 = 52 + 72 x2 = 25 + 49 x2 = 74 x = 8.6cm Example 3 Check whether the triangle with sides 9m, 40m and 41m is a right-angled triangle. BC2 = 412 = 1681 AB2 + AC2 = 92 + 402 = 81 + 1600 = 1681 BC2 = AB2 + AC2 The triangle satisfies Pythagoras’ theorem and so is a right-angled triangle. Activity Your browser does not support iframes.

Carissa Wonders, “Why is the pythagorean theorem so important?” Thanks for WONDERing with us, Carissa! There are certain things you learn in that you use on an everyday basis. Some of these things include reading, writing, , and basic mathematics, such as , subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then there are other things that you learn in school that you probably don't use every single day. How often do you need to know when started? Does knowing the of the process of photosynthesis come in every day? How about all those and ? Will ever be useful in real life? Actually, you might be surprised how often you end up using algebra and other without even it. Let's take a look at one of those you may have learned about in school: the Pythagorean Theorem. The name makes it sound like something to particle , but it's actually a fairly simple, way to the length of the third side of a right triangle if you know the lengths of the other two sides. The that from the Pythagorean Theorem is familiar to many: a2 + b2 = c2. In this , c represents the longest side (known as the ) of a right triangle. Reminder: a right triangle is a triangle that has one 90˚ angle. The letters a and b represent the other two sides. Stated another way, the Pythagorean Theorem holds that, in a right triangle, the square of the is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, if side a measures 3 and side b measures 4, you can that side c will measure 5 (32 + 42 = 52 or 9 + 16 = 25). It will help you to know how to square roots, and you can also use basic algebra to figure out any missing side of a right triangle as long as you know two of its . The Pythagorean Theorem is credited to Pythagoras, who was a Greek philosopher and mathematician that lived in the 5th century B.C. However, historians have discovered that other ancient knew about the basic mathematics of the Pythagorean Theorem thousands of years earlier. For example, new studies show that the ancient pillars of Stonehenge may have been placed very precisely using the geometry of the Pythagorean Theorem. Although no one knows who built Stonehenge, historians believe it was over 2,000 years before Pythagoras was born. Does the Pythagorean Theorem have any usefulness in real life? You bet it does! First, it's often used as the basis for more complicated mathematics, including calculating areas, volumes, and perimeters of all sorts of geometric shapes. On a day to day basis, you might find yourself using the Pythagorean Theorem in certain types of jobs and tasks. These might include architecture, construction, navigation, and surveying. Basically, any time you build something and you need to use square angles or know how long one side of a triangle needs to be, you'll be using the Pythagorean Theorem!

It is also called an ""Equation of Degree 2"" (because of the ""2"" on the x) Standard Form The Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation looks like this: a, b and c are known values. a can't be 0. ""x"" is the or unknown (we don't know it yet). Here are some examples: 2x2 + 5x + 3 = 0 In this one a=2, b=5 and c=3 x2 − 3x = 0 This one is a little more tricky: Where is a? Well a=1, as we don't usually write ""1x2"" b = −3 And where is c? Well c=0, so is not shown. 5x − 3 = 0 Oops! This one is not a quadratic equation: it is missing x2 (in other words a=0, which means it can't be quadratic) Have a Play With It Play with the """" so you can see: the function's graph, and the solutions (called ""roots""). Hidden Quadratic Equations! As we saw before, the Standard Form of a Quadratic Equation is ax2 + bx + c = 0 But sometimes a quadratic equation does not look like that! For example: In disguise In Standard Form a, b and c x2 = 3x − 1 Move all terms to left hand side x2 − 3x + 1 = 0 a=1, b=−3, c=1 2(w2 − 2w) = 5 (undo the ), and move 5 to left 2w2 − 4w − 5 = 0 a=2, b=−4, c=−5 z(z−1) = 3 Expand, and move 3 to left z2 − z − 3 = 0 a=1, b=−1, c=−3 How To Solve Them? The ""solutions"" to the Quadratic Equation are where it is equal to zero. They are also called ""roots"", or sometimes ""zeros"" There are usually 2 solutions (as shown in this graph). And there are a few different ways to find the solutions: We can (find what to multiply to make the Quadratic Equation) Or we can Or we can use the special Quadratic Formula: Just plug in the values of a, b and c, and do the calculations. We will look at this method in more detail now. About the Quadratic Formula Plus/Minus First of all what is that plus/minus thing that looks like ± ? The ± means there are TWO answers: x = −b + √(b2 − 4ac) 2a x = −b − √(b2 − 4ac) 2a Here is an example with two answers: But it does not always work out like that! Imagine if the curve ""just touches"" the x-axis. Or imagine the curve is so high it doesn't even cross the x-axis! This is where the ""Discriminant"" helps us ... Discriminant Do you see b2 − 4ac in the formula above? It is called the Discriminant, because it can ""discriminate"" between the possible types of answer: when b2 − 4ac is positive, we get two Real solutions when it is zero we get just ONE real solution (both answers are the same) when it is negative we get a pair of solutions Complex solutions? Let's talk about them after we see how to use the formula. Using the Quadratic Formula Just put the values of a, b and c into the Quadratic Formula, and do the calculations. Example: Solve 5x2 + 6x + 1 = 0 Coefficients are:a = 5, b = 6, c = 1 Quadratic Formula:x = −b ± √(b2 − 4ac) 2a Put in a, b and c:x = −6 ± √(62 − 4×5×1) 2×5 Solve:x = −6 ± √(36− 20) 10 x = −6 ± √(16) 10 x = −6 ± 4 10 x = −0.2 or −1 Answer: x = −0.2 or x = −1 And we see them on this graph. Check -0.2: 5×(−0.2)2 + 6×(−0.2) + 1 = 5×(0.04) + 6×(−0.2) + 1 = 0.2 − 1.2 + 1 = 0 Check -1: 5×(−1)2 + 6×(−1) + 1 = 5×(1) + 6×(−1) + 1 = 5 − 6 + 1 = 0 Remembering The Formula A kind reader suggested singing it to ""Pop Goes the Weasel"": ♫ ""x is equal to minus b ♫ ""All around the mulberry bush plus or minus the square root The monkey chased the weasel of b-squared minus four a c The monkey thought 'twas all in fun ALL over two a"" Pop! goes the weasel"" Try singing it a few times and it will get stuck in your head! Or you can remember this story: x = −b ± √(b2 − 4ac) 2a ""A negative boy was thinking yes or no about going to a party, at the party he talked to a square boy but not to the 4 awesome chicks. It was all over at 2 am."" Complex Solutions? When the Discriminant (the value b2 − 4ac) is negative we get a pair of Complex solutions ... what does that mean? It means our answer will include . Wow! Example: Solve 5x2 + 2x + 1 = 0 Coefficients are:a=5, b=2, c=1 Note that the Discriminant is negative:b2 − 4ac = 22 − 4×5×1 = −16 Use the Quadratic Formula:x = −2 ± √(−16) 10 √(−16) = 4i (where i is the imaginary number √−1) So:x = −2 ± 4i 10 Answer: x = −0.2 ± 0.4i The graph does not cross the x-axis. That is why we ended up with complex numbers. In a way it is easier: we don't need more calculation, we leave it as −0.2 ± 0.4i. Example: Solve x2 − 4x + 6.25 = 0 Coefficients are:a=1, b=−4, c=6.25 Note that the Discriminant is negative:b2 − 4ac = (−4)2 − 4×1×6.25 = −9 Use the Quadratic Formula:x = −(−4) ± √(−9) 2 √(−9) = 3i (where i is the imaginary number √−1) So:x = 4 ± 3i 2 Answer: x = 2 ± 1.5i The graph does not cross the x-axis. That is why we ended up with complex numbers. BUT an upside-down mirror image of our equation does cross the x-axis at 2 ± 1.5 (note: missing the i). Just an interesting fact for you! Summary Quadratic Equation in Standard Form: ax2 + bx + c = 0 Quadratic Equations can be Quadratic Formula: x = −b ± √(b2 − 4ac) 2a When the Discriminant (b2−4ac) is: positive, there are 2 real solutions zero, there is one real solution negative, there are 2 complex solutions 360, 361, 1201, 1202, 2333, 2334, 3894, 3895, 2335, 2336 Copyright © 2021 MathsIsFun.com"

Solving Quadratic Equations Solving Quadratic Equations A quadratic equation is an equation that could be written as ax 2 + bx + c = 0 when a 0. There are three basic methods for solving quadratic equations: factoring, using the quadratic formula, and completing the square. FactoringTo solve a quadratic equation by factoring, Put all terms on one side of the equal sign, leaving zero on the other side. Factor. Set each factor equal to zero. Solve each of these equations. Check by inserting your answer in the original equation. Example 1Solve x 2 – 6 x = 16. Following the steps, x 2 – 6 x = 16 becomes x 2 – 6 x – 16 = 0 Factor.( x – 8)( x + 2) = 0 Setting each factor to zero, Then to check, Both values, 8 and –2, are solutions to the original equation.Example 2Solve y 2 = – 6 y – 5. Setting all terms equal to zero, y 2 + 6 y + 5 = 0 Factor.( y + 5)( y + 1) = 0 Setting each factor to 0, To check, y 2 = –6 y – 5 A quadratic with a term missing is called an incomplete quadratic (as long as the ax 2 term isn't missing). Example 3Solve x 2 – 16 = 0. Factor. To check, x 2 – 16 = 0 Example 4Solve x 2 + 6 x = 0. Factor. To check, x 2 + 6 x = 0 Example 5Solve 2 x 2 + 2 x – 1 = x 2 + 6 x – 5. First, simplify by putting all terms on one side and combining like terms. Now, factor. To check, 2 x 2 + 2 x – 1 = x 2 + 6 x – 5 The quadratic formulaMany quadratic equations cannot be solved by factoring. This is generally true when the roots, or answers, are not rational numbers. A second method of solving quadratic equations involves the use of the following formula: a, b, and c are taken from the quadratic equation written in its general form of ax 2 + bx + c = 0 where a is the numeral that goes in front of x 2, b is the numeral that goes in front of x, and c is the numeral with no variable next to it (a.k.a., “the constant”). When using the quadratic formula, you should be aware of three possibilities. These three possibilities are distinguished by a part of the formula called the discriminant. The discriminant is the value under the radical sign, b 2 – 4 ac. A quadratic equation with real numbers as coefficients can have the following: Two different real roots if the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is a positive number. One real root if the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is equal to 0. No real root if the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is a negative number. Example 6Solve for x: x 2 – 5 x = –6. Setting all terms equal to 0, x 2 – 5 x + 6 = 0 Then substitute 1 (which is understood to be in front of the x 2), –5, and 6 for a, b, and c, respectively, in the quadratic formula and simplify. Because the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is positive, you get two different real roots. Example produces rational roots. In Example , the quadratic formula is used to solve an equation whose roots are not rational. Example 7Solve for y: y 2 = –2y + 2. Setting all terms equal to 0, y 2 + 2 y – 2 = 0 Then substitute 1, 2, and –2 for a, b, and c, respectively, in the quadratic formula and simplify. Note that the two roots are irrational.Example 8Solve for x: x 2 + 2 x + 1 = 0. Substituting in the quadratic formula, Since the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is 0, the equation has one root. The quadratic formula can also be used to solve quadratic equations whose roots are imaginary numbers, that is, they have no solution in the real number system.Example 9Solve for x: x( x + 2) + 2 = 0, or x 2 + 2 x + 2 = 0. Substituting in the quadratic formula, Since the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is negative, this equation has no solution in the real number system. But if you were to express the solution using imaginary numbers, the solutions would be . Completing the squareA third method of solving quadratic equations that works with both real and imaginary roots is called completing the square. Put the equation into the form ax 2 + bx = – c. Make sure that a = 1 (if a ≠ 1, multiply through the equation by before proceeding). Using the value of b from this new equation, add to both sides of the equation to form a perfect square on the left side of the equation. Find the square root of both sides of the equation. Solve the resulting equation. Example 10Solve for x: x 2 – 6 x + 5 = 0. Arrange in the form of Because a = 1, add , or 9, to both sides to complete the square. Take the square root of both sides. x – 3 = ±2 Solve. Example 11Solve for y: y 2+ 2 y – 4 = 0. Arrange in the form of Because a = 1, add , or 1, to both sides to complete the square. Take the square root of both sides. Solve. Example 12Solve for x: 2 x 2 + 3 x + 2 = 0. Arrange in the form of Because a ≠ 1, multiply through the equation by . Add or to both sides. Take the square root of both sides. There is no solution in the real number system. It may interest you to know that the completing the square process for solving quadratic equations was used on the equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 to derive the quadratic formula.

To solve \[x^{2}-2x-24=0\] Fully factorise the quadratic equation. We can factorise a quadratic into two brackets when it is in the form ax2 + bx + c or when two square numbers (perfect squares) are subtracted from each other in the form a2 − b2, also known as the difference of two squares. \[x^{2}-2x-24=0\] Factors1, 242, 123, 84, 6 \[\begin{aligned} -6+4&=-2\\ -6\times 4&=-24 \end{aligned}\] \[(x-6)(x+4)=0\] 2 Set each bracket equal to 0. \[x-6=0\qquad \qquad x+4=0\] 3 Solve each equation to find x. \[\begin{aligned} x-6&=0 \quad &x+4&=0\\ x&=6 \quad &x&=-4 \end{aligned}\] We can check that our solution is correct by substituting it into the original equation.

The opposite of − 25 is + 25, so + 25 to both sides of the equation. The opposite of squaring is square root, so take the square root of the left hand side, and the right hand side. Remember a square root has a positive and a negative solution, so use the ± sign. 3 The square root has a + and – answer, write down both versions of the calculation to find the two solutions of x. \[\begin{aligned} x&=\sqrt{25}+1 \quad &x&=-\sqrt{25}+1\\ x&=5+1 \quad &x&=-5+1\\ x&=6 \quad &x&=-4 \end{aligned}\] We can check that our solution is correct by substituting it into the original equation. Example 4: quadratic equation – solve by drawing a graph We can plot a quadratic equation to form a quadratic graph to help us to solve it. We can substitute values for x into quadratic function to produce values for y. When we plot these values on an x, y grid we get a special ‘U’ shaped curve called a parabola. Example of solving a quadratic equation by drawing the graph: To solve \[x^{2}-2x-24=0\] we need to: Draw the quadratic graph 2 The solutions/roots of equation are where the graph crosses the x -axis (when y =0) We know that to solve"

Yes, the expression under the radical of the Quadratic Formula makes it easy for us to determine the number and type of solutions. This expression is called the discriminant.

Methods for Solving Quadratic Equations Factoring Square Root Property Completing the Square Quadratic Formula Given that we have four methods to use to solve a quadratic equation, how do you decide which one to use? Factoring is often the quickest method and so we try it first. If the equation is or we use the Square Root Property. For any other equation, it is probably best to use the Quadratic Formula. Remember, you can solve any quadratic equation by using the Quadratic Formula, but that is not always the easiest method. What about the method of Completing the Square?

There are usually two values of 𝑥, corresponding to the positive and negative square roots of 𝑏−4𝑎𝑐, but sometimes there is only one, or even no real solutions, depending on the values of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐.We will discuss how to solve a quadratic equation which is already in the form 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0, 𝑎≠0 in our first example.Example 1: Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic FormulaFind the solution set of the equation 6𝑥−8𝑥+1=0, giving values to two decimal places.Answer As the equation 6𝑥−8𝑥+1=0 is a quadratic equation, then we can use one of the methods for solving quadratics. In this case, we are going to use the quadratic formula in order to solve. Recall, that for a quadratic equation in the form 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0, 𝑎≠0, then 𝑥=−𝑏±√𝑏−4𝑎𝑐2𝑎.Since 6𝑥−8𝑥+1=0 is already in the same form as 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0 since it is equal to zero, fully simplified, and written in descending powers of 𝑥, then we can identify the values of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐: 𝑎=6,𝑏=−8,𝑐=1.andSubstituting these values into the quadratic formula and solving for 𝑥, we get 𝑥=−𝑏±√𝑏−4𝑎𝑐2𝑎=−(−8)±(−8)−4(6)(1)2(6)=8±√64−2412=8±√4012=8±2√1012=4±√106.As we are asked to give the solution set to 2 decimal places, then evaluating 𝑥, we get 𝑥=1.19…0.14….orSo, the solution set of the equation 6𝑥−8𝑥+1=0 is {0.14,1.19} correct to 2 decimal places.In the next example, we will consider how to solve a quadratic equation that is not in the form 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0 initially but, by rearranging, can be put in this form and then solved using the quadratic formula.Example 2: Solving Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic FormulaFind the solution set of 𝑥−6(𝑥−1)=2 in ℝ, giving values to two decimal places.Answer As the equation 𝑥−6(𝑥−1)=2 contains a term with 𝑥, then this is likely to be a quadratic equation. To check, we can simplify by expanding brackets and making the equation equal to zero, as follows: 𝑥−6(𝑥−1)=2𝑥−6𝑥+6=2𝑥−6𝑥+4=0.As the highest power in the equation is 2, then we can see this is a quadratic equation. Since it is now written in the form 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0, 𝑎≠0 then we can apply the quadratic formula, which states 𝑥=−𝑏±√𝑏−4𝑎𝑐2𝑎.We can see that for 𝑥−6𝑥+4=0, 𝑎=1, 𝑏=−6, and 𝑐=4. Substituting this into the quadratic formula, we get 𝑥=−(−6)±(−6)−4(1)(4)2(1).Simplifying, we get 𝑥=6±√36−162=6±√202=6±2√52=3±√5.As we are asked to give the solution set to 2 decimal places, then evaluating 𝑥, we get 𝑥=5.24…𝑥=0.76….orSo, the solution set of 𝑥−6(𝑥−1)=2 correct to 2 decimal places is {0.76,5.24}.We can use the solutions of quadratic equations to find unknown parts of the equation, such as coefficients or constants. We can do this by substituting known and unknown parts into the quadratic formula and solving for the unknown part. We will explore how to do this in the next example.Example 3: Finding Unknowns in Quadratic Equations Using the Quadratic FormulaGiven that 𝑥=−2 is a root of the equation 𝑥−4𝑚𝑥−𝑚−6=0, find the set of possible values of 𝑚.Answer Since 𝑥−4𝑚𝑥−𝑚−6=0 is of the form of a quadratic equation, then we can use the quadratic formula to find the values of 𝑚.The quadratic formula states that for an equation in the form 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0, 𝑎≠0 then 𝑥=−𝑏±√𝑏−4𝑎𝑐2𝑎.We can see by comparing 𝑥−4𝑚𝑥−𝑚−6=0 with 𝑎𝑥+𝑏𝑥+𝑐=0 that 𝑎=1, 𝑏=−4𝑚, and 𝑐=−𝑚−6. Since we also know that one of the roots of the equation is 𝑥=−2 then we can substitute 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 and 𝑥 into the quadratic formula: 𝑥=−𝑏±√𝑏−4𝑎𝑐2𝑎−2=−(−4𝑚)±(−4𝑚)−4(−(𝑚−6)(1))2(1).Simplifying, we get −2=4𝑚±√16𝑚+4(𝑚−6)2=4𝑚±√16𝑚+4𝑚−242=4𝑚±√20𝑚−242.We can simplify further by factoring out 4 and putting it outside the radical: −2=4𝑚±√4(5𝑚−6)2=4𝑚±2√(5𝑚−6)2=2𝑚±√(5𝑚−6).Next, we need to solve"

So we factored by substitution allowing us to make it fit the \(ax^{2}+bx+c\) form. We used the standard \(u\) for the substitution. To factor the expression \(x^{4}-4 x^{2}-5\), we noticed the variable part of the middle term is \(x^{2}\) and its square, \(x^{4}\), is the variable part of the first term. (We know \(\left(x^{2}\right)^{2}=x^{4}\).) So we let \(u=x^{2}\) and factored. \(x^{4}-4 x^{2}-5\) \(\left(\color{red}x^2 \color{black} \right)^{2}-4\left( \color{red}x^{2} \color{black}\right)-5\) Let \(u=x^{2}\) and substitute. \(\color{red}u \color{black}^{2}-4 \color{red}u \color{black}-5\) Factor the trinomial. \((u+1)(u-5)\) Replace \(u\) with \(x^{2}\). \(\left( \color{red}x^{2} \color{black} + 1\right)\left( \color{red}x^2 \color{black}-5\right)\) Similarly, sometimes an equation is not in the \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\) form but looks much like a quadratic equation. Then, we can often make a thoughtful substitution that will allow us to make it fit the \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\) form. If we can make it fit the form, we can then use all of our methods to solve quadratic equations. Notice that in the quadratic equation \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), the middle term has a variable, \(x\), and its square, \(x^{2}\), is the variable part of the first term. Look for this relationship as you try to find a substitution. Again, we will use the standard \(u\) to make a substitution that will put the equation in quadratic form. If the substitution gives us an equation of the form \(ax^{2}+bx+c=0\), we say the original equation was of quadratic form. The next example shows the steps for solving an equation in quadratic form. Example \(\PageIndex{1}\) How to Solve Equations in Quadratic Form Solve: \(6 x^{4}-7 x^{2}+2=0\) Solution: Step 1: Identify a substitution that will put the equation in quadratic form. Since \(\left(x^{2}\right)^{2}=x^{4}\), we let \(u=x^{2}\). \(6 x^{4}-7 x^{2}+2=0\) Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the substitution to put it in quadratic form. Rewrite to prepare for the substitution. Substitute \(u=x^{2}\). \(\begin{aligned}6\color{black}{\left(\color{red}{x^{2}}\right)}^{2}-7\color{red}{ x^{2}}\color{black}{+}2&=0 \\ \color{black}{6 \color{red}{u}^{2}}-7 \color{red}{u}\color{black}{+}2&=0\end{aligned}\) Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation for \(u\). We can solve by factoring. Use the Zero Product Property. \(\begin{aligned}(2 u-1)(3 u-2) &=0 \\ 2 u-1=0, 3 u-2&=0 \\ 2 u =1,3 u&=2 \\ u =\frac{1}{2} u&=\frac{2}{3} \end{aligned}\) Step 4: Substitute the original variable back into the results, using the substitution. Replace \(u\) with \(x^{2}\). \(x^{2}=\frac{1}{2} \quad x^{2}=\frac{2}{3}\) Step 5: Solve for the original variable. Solve for \(x\), using the Square Root Property. \(\begin{array}{ll}{x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}}} & {x=\pm \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}} \\ {x=\pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} & {x=\pm \frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}}\end{array}\) There are four solutions. \(\begin{array}{ll}{x=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} & {x=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}} \\ {x=-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} & {x=-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{3}}\end{array}\) Step 6: Check the solutions. Check all four solutions. We will show one check here. \(\begin{aligned}x&=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ 6 x^{4}-7 x^{2}+2&=0 \\ 6\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^{4}-7\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^{2}+2 &\stackrel{?}{=} 0\\ 6\left(\frac{4}{16} \right)-7\left(\frac{2}{4} \right)^{2}+2&\stackrel{?}{=}0 \\ \frac{3}{2}-\frac{7}{2}+\frac{4}{2}&\stackrel{?}{=}0 \\ 0&=0 \end{aligned}\) We leave the other checks to you!

Solve Equations in Quadratic Form Identify a substitution that will put the equation in quadratic form. Rewrite the equation with the substitution to put it in quadratic form. Solve the quadratic equation for \(u\). Substitute the original variable back into the results, using the substitution. Solve for the original variable. Check the solutions. In the next example, the binomial in the middle term, \((x-2)\) is squared in the first term. If we let \(u=x-2\) and substitute, our trinomial will be in \(a x^{2}+b x+c\) form.

The Principle of Zero Products The Principle of Zero Products states that if the product of two numbers is 0, then at least one of the factors is 0. (This is not really new.) Principle of Zero Products If ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0, or both a and b are 0. This property may seem fairly obvious, but it has big implications for solving quadratic equations. If you have a factored polynomial that is equal to 0, you know that at least one of the factors or both factors equal 0. You can use this method to solve quadratic equations. Let’s start with one that is already factored. Example Problem Solve (x + 4)(x – 3) = 0 for x. (x + 4)(x – 3) = 0 Applying the Principle of Zero Products, you know that if the product is 0, then one or both of the factors has to be 0. x + 4 = 0 or x – 3 = 0 Set each factor equal to 0. x + 4 – 4 = 0 – 4 x – 3 + 3 = 0 + 3 x = −4 or x = 3 Solve each equation. Answer x = −4 OR x = 3 You can check these solutions by substituting each one at a time into the original equation, (x + 4)(x – 3) = 0. You can also try another number to see what happens. Checking x = −4 Checking x = 3 Trying x = 5 (x + 4)(x – 3) = 0 (x + 4)(x – 3) = 0 (x+ 4)(x – 3) = 0 (−4 + 4)(−4 – 3) = 0 (3 + 4)(3 – 3) = 0 (5 + 4)(5 – 2) = 0 (0)( −7) = 0 (7)(0) = 0 (9)(3) = 0 0 = 0 0 = 0 27 ≠ 0 The two values that we found via factoring, x = −4 and x = 3, lead to true statements: 0 = 0. So, the solutions are correct. But x = 5, the value not found by factoring, creates an untrue statement—27 does not equal 0! Solve for x. (x – 5)(2x + 7) = 0 A) x = 5 or B) x = 5 or −7 C) x = 0 or D) x = 0 A) x = 5 or Correct. To find the roots of this equation, apply the Principle of Zero Products and set each factor, (x – 5) and (2x + 7), equal to 0. x – 5 = 0, so x = 5; you also find that 2x + 7 = 0, so 2x = −7, and x = . Both answers, x = 5 and , are solutions. B) x = 5 or −7 Incorrect. While x = 5 does make the equation true, the Principle of Zero Products states if (x – 5)(2x + 7) = 0 then either x – 5 = 0 or 2x + 7 = 0. This happens when x = 5 or. C) x = 0 or Incorrect. While x = does make the equation true, the Principle of Zero Products states if (x – 5)(2x + 7) = 0 then either x – 5 = 0 or 2x + 7 = 0. This happens when x = 5 or. D) x = 0 Incorrect. A value of x = 0 does not make the equation true: (0 – 5)[2(0) + 7] = (−5)(7) = −35, not 0. The Principle of Zero Products states if (x – 5)(2x + 7) = 0 then either x – 5 = 0 or 2x + 7 = 0. This happens when x = 5 or. Solving Quadratics Let’s try solving an equation that looks a bit different: 5a2 + 15a = 0. Example Problem Solve for a: 5a2 + 15a = 0. 5a2 + 15a = 0 Begin by factoring the left side of the equation. 5a(a + 3) = 0 Factor out 5a, which is a common factor of 5a2 and 15a. 5a = 0 or a + 3 = 0 Set each factor equal to zero. or a = 0 a + 3 – 3 = 0 – 3 a = −3 Solve each equation. Answer a = 0 OR a = −3 To check your answers, you can substitute both values directly into the original equation and see if you get a true sentence for each. Checking a = 0 Checking a = −3 5a2 + 15a = 0 5a2 + 15a = 0 5(0)2 + 15(0) = 0 5(−3)2 + (15)(−3) = 0 5(0) + 0 = 0 5(9) – 45 = 0 0 + 0 = 0 45 – 45 = 0 0 = 0 0 = 0 Both solutions check. You can use the Principle of Zero Products to solve quadratic equations in the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. First factor the expression, and set each factor equal to 0. Example Problem Solve for r: r2 – 5r + 6 = 0. r2 – 3r + −2r + 6 = 0 Rewrite −5r as −3r – 2r, as (−3)(−2) = 6, and −3 + −2 = −5. (r2 – 3r) + (−2r + 6) = 0 Group pairs. r(r – 3) – 2(r – 3) = 0 Factor out r from the first pair and factor out −2 from the second pair. (r – 3)(r – 2) = 0 Factor out (r – 3). r – 3 = 0 or r – 2 = 0 Use the Principle of Zero Products to set each factor equal to 0. r = 3 or r = 2 Solve each equation. Answer r = 3 OR r = 2 The roots of the original equation are 3 or 2. Note in the example above, if the common factor of 2 had been factored out, the resulting factor would be (−r + 3), which is the negative of (r – 3). So factoring out −2 will result in the common factor of (r – 3). If we had gotten (−r + 3) as a factor, then when setting that factor equal to zero and solving for r we would have gotten: (−r + 3) = 0 Principle of Zero Products (−1)(−r + 3) = (−1)0 Multiplying both sides by −1. r − 3 = 0 Multiplying. r = 3 Adding 3 to both sides. More work, but the same result as before, r = 3 or r = 2. Solve"
0,purplemath,Solving Quadratic Equations - Math help from the Learning ...,https://www.purplemath.com/modules/solvquad.htm,"solve the quadratic equation by factoring. Solve (x − 3)(x − 4) = 0 by factoring. Okay, this quadratic is already factored for me. But how do I use this factorisation to solve the equation? The Zero Factor Principle tells me that at least one of the factors must be equal to zero. Since at least one of the factors must be zero, then I can set each of the factors equal to zero: x − 3 = 0 or x − 4 = 0 This gives me simple linear equations, and they're easy to : x = 3 or x = 4 And these two values are the solution they're looking for: x = 3, 4 Note that ""x = 3, 4"" means the same thing as ""x = 3 or x = 4""; the only difference is the formatting. The ""x = 3, 4"" format is more common. Affiliate Affordable tutors for hireFind tutors Solve x2 + 5x + 6 = 0, and check. Affiliate Affordable tutors for hireFind tutors This equation is already in the form ""(quadratic) equals (zero)"" but, unlike the previous example, this isn't yet factored. I MUST factor the quadratic first, because it is only when I MULTIPLY and get zero that I can say anything about the factors and solutions. I can't conclude anything about the individual terms of the unfactored quadratic (like the 5x or the 6), because I can add lots of stuff that totals to zero. So the first thing I have to do is factor: x2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3) Now I can restate the original equation in terms of a product of factors, with this product being equal to zero: (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 Now I can solve each factor by setting each one equal to zero and solving the resulting linear equations: x + 2 = 0 or x + 3 = 0 x = −2 or x = − 3 These two values are the solution to the original quadratic equation. So my answer is: x = −3, −2 I'm not done, though, because the original exercise told me to ""check"", which means that I need to plug my answers back into the original equation, and make sure it comes out right. In this case, I'll be plugging into the expression on the left-hand side of the original equation, and verifying that I end up with the right-hand side; in other words, I need to confirm that plugging in these solution values results with the left-hand side equalling 0: checking x = −3: [−3]2 + 5[−3] + 6 9 − 15 + 6 9 + 6 − 15 15 − 15 0 checking x = −2: [−2]2 + 5[−2] + 6 4 − 10 + 6 4 + 6 − 10 10 − 10 0 When an exercise specifies that you should solve ""and check"", they're looking for you to show that you've plugged your answers into the original exercise and gotten something that worked out right. The above, where I showed my checks, is all they're wanting. Just make sure to do your work neatly. By the way, you can use this ""checking"" technique to your answers to any ""solving"" exercise. So, for instance, if you're not sure of your answer to a ""factor and solve"" question on the next test, try plugging your answers into the original equation, and confirming that your solutions lead to true statements.

We have seen that some quadratic equations can be solved by factoring. In this chapter, we will use three other methods to solve quadratic equations. Solve Quadratic Equations of the Form ax2 = k Using the Square Root Property We have already solved some quadratic equations by factoring. Let’s review how we used factoring to solve the quadratic equation x2=9x2=9. x2=9Put the equation in standard form.x2−9=0Factor the left side.(x−3)(x+3)=0Use the Zero Product Property.(x−3)=0,(x+3)=0Solve each equation.x=3,x=−3Combine the two solutions into±form.x=±3(The solution is read‘xis equal to positive or negative 3.’)x2=9Put the equation in standard form.x2−9=0Factor the left side.(x−3)(x+3)=0Use the Zero Product Property.(x−3)=0,(x+3)=0Solve each equation.x=3,x=−3Combine the two solutions into±form.x=±3(The solution is read‘xis equal to positive or negative 3.’) We can easily use factoring to find the solutions of similar equations, like x2=16x2=16 and x2=25x2=25, because 16 and 25 are perfect squares. But what happens when we have an equation like x2=7x2=7? Since 7 is not a perfect square, we cannot solve the equation by factoring. These equations are all of the form x2=kx2=k.We defined the square root of a number in this way: Ifn2=m,thennis a square root ofm.Ifn2=m,thennis a square root ofm. This leads to the Square Root Property. Square Root Property If x2=kx2=k, and k≥0k≥0, then x=korx=−kx=korx=−k. Notice that the Square Root Property gives two solutions to an equation of the form x2=kx2=k: the principal square root of kk and its opposite. We could also write the solution as x=±kx=±k. Now, we will solve the equation x2=9x2=9 again, this time using the Square Root Property. x2=9Use the Square Root Property.x=±9Simplify the radical.x=±3Rewrite to show the two solutions.x=3,x=−3x2=9Use the Square Root Property.x=±9Simplify the radical.x=±3Rewrite to show the two solutions.x=3,x=−3 What happens when the constant is not a perfect square?

Step 3. Simplify the radical. Step 4. Check the solutions. To use the Square Root Property, the coefficient of the variable term must equal 1. In the next example, we must divide both sides of the equation by 5 before using the Square Root Property. Example 10.3 Solve: 5m2=805m2=80. Solution The quadratic term is isolated. 5m2=805m2=80 Divide by 5 to make its cofficient 1. 5m25=8055m25=805 Simplify. m2=16m2=16 Use the Square Root Property. m=±16m=±16 Simplify the radical. m=±4m=±4 Rewrite to show two solutions. m=4,m=−4m=4,m=−4 Check the solutions.

We’ll also take a closer look at how these methods are connected to each other.Let’s get started.How To Solve Quadratic EquationsHere are four methods you can use to solve a :Graphing – this is a good visual method if you have the vertex form of a parabola or if you have a parabola-like curve from a data set. If you function f(x) = ax2 + bx + c, you can find out where it intersects the x-axis. The only drawback is that it can be difficult to find exact values of x. Also, the graph will not intersect the x-axis if the solutions are complex (in the case of a negative discriminant).– this method is helpful in some cases to avoid the work of graphing, completing the square, or using the . However, some quadratics are difficult to factor, and the quadratic formula would be more helpful in those cases. – this method is a long one, but it works. The quadratic formula is a shortcut for this method. We also use the method of completing the square to put certain circle equations into the proper form. – this method always works. It is derived from using the previous method (complete the square) on a general quadratic in standard form: ax2 + bx + c = 0. The only drawback is that the calculations can become tedious, as they involve multiplication, addition, radicals, and division (fractions).Here is how these methods are connected to one another:When the method of completing the square is used on the general quadratic equation in standard form, ax2 + bx + c = 0, we get the quadratic formula as a result.When we use the quadratic formula on a quadratic equation, we get two solutions to the equation: r and s. These solutions may be distinct and real (positive discriminant), double real (zero discriminant), or complex conjugates (negative discriminant).If we use the coefficient ‘a’ together with the solutions r and s, we can write the factored form of the quadratic equation as a(x – r)(x – s) = 0.If we take the average of the two solutions r and s, we can find the x-coordinate of the parabola’s vertex (that is, the axis of symmetry). If r and s are real, we also have x-intercepts for the parabola, which makes it easier to graph.Let’s take a look at some examples of each method, starting with graphing.When Does A Quadratic Have No Solut...Please enable JavaScriptHow To Solve"

The ''U'' shaped graph of a quadratic is called a parabola. A quadratic equation has two solutions. Either two distinct real solutions, one double real solution or two imaginary solutions. There are several methods you can use to solve a quadratic equation: Factoring Completing the Square Quadratic Formula Graphing All methods start with setting the equation equal to zero. Solve for x in the following equation. Example 1: The equation is already set to zero. Method 1: Factoring Method 2: Completing the square Divide both sides of the equation by 2. Add to both sides of the equation. Add to both sides of the equation: Factor the left side and simplify the right side : Take the square root of both sides of the equation : Add to both sides of the equation : Method 3: Quadratic Formula The quadratic formula is In the equation ,a is the coefficient of the term, b is the coefficient of the x term, and c is the constant. Substitute 2 for a, -1 for b, and -1 for c in the quadratic formula and simplify. Method 4: Graphing Graph y= the left side of the equation or and graph y= the right side of the equation or y=0. The graph of y=0 is nothing more than the x-axis. So what you will be looking for is where the graph of crosses the x-axis. Another way of saying this is that the x-intercepts are the solutions to this equation. You can see from the graph that there are two x-intercepts, one at 1 and one at . The answers are 1 and These answers may or may not be solutions to the original equations. You must verify that these answers are solutions. Check these answers in the original equation. Check the solution x=1 by substituting 1 in the original equation for x. If the left side of the equation equals the right side of the equation after the substitution, you have found the correct answer. Left Side: Right Side: Since the left side of the original equation is equal to the right side of the original equation after we substitute the value 1 for x, then x=1 is a solution. Check the solution by substituting in the original equation for x. If the left side of the equation equals the right side of the equation after the substitution, you have found the correct answer. Left Side: Right Side: Since the left side of the original equation is equal to the right side of the original equation after we substitute the value for x, then is a solution.

The Zero-Product Property and Quadratic Equations The zero-product property states [latex]\text{If }a\cdot b=0,\text{ then }a=0\text{ or }b=0,[/latex] where a and b are real numbers or algebraic expressions. A quadratic equation is an equation containing a second-degree polynomial; for example [latex]a{x}^{2}+bx+c=0[/latex] where a, b, and c are real numbers, and if[latex]\,a\ne 0,[/latex]it is in standard form. Solving Quadratics with a Leading Coefficient of 1 In the quadratic equation[latex]\,{x}^{2}+x-6=0,[/latex]the leading coefficient, or the coefficient of[latex]\,{x}^{2},[/latex]is 1. We have one method of factoring quadratic equations in this form. How To Given a quadratic equation with the leading coefficient of 1, factor it. Find two numbers whose product equals c and whose sum equals b. Use those numbers to write two factors of the form[latex]\,\left(x+k\right)\text{ or }\left(x-k\right),[/latex]where k is one of the numbers found in step 1. Use the numbers exactly as they are. In other words, if the two numbers are 1 and[latex]\,-2,[/latex]the factors are[latex]\,\left(x+1\right)\left(x-2\right).[/latex] Solve using the zero-product property by setting each factor equal to zero and solving for the variable. Solving a Quadratic Equation by Factoring when the Leading Coefficient is not 1 Factor and solve the equation:[latex]\,{x}^{2}+x-6=0.[/latex] Show Solution To factor[latex]\,{x}^{2}+x-6=0,[/latex]we look for two numbers whose product equals[latex]\,-6\,[/latex]and whose sum equals 1. Begin by looking at the possible factors of[latex]\,-6.[/latex] [latex]\begin{array}{c}1\cdot \left(-6\right)\\ \left(-6\right)\cdot 1\\ 2\cdot \left(-3\right)\\ 3\cdot \left(-2\right)\end{array}[/latex] The last pair,[latex]\,3\cdot \left(-2\right)\,[/latex]sums to 1, so these are the numbers. Note that only one pair of numbers will work. Then, write the factors. [latex]\left(x-2\right)\left(x+3\right)=0[/latex] To solve this equation, we use the zero-product property. Set each factor equal to zero and solve. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \left(x-2\right)\left(x+3\right)& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill \left(x-2\right)& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& 2\hfill \\ \hfill \left(x+3\right)& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& -3\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The two solutions are [latex]\,2\,[/latex] and [latex]\,-3.\,[/latex]We can see how the solutions relate to the graph in .

With the equation in standard form, let’s review the grouping procedures: With the quadratic in standard form,[latex]\,a{x}^{2}+bx+c=0,[/latex]multiply[latex]\,a\cdot c.[/latex] Find two numbers whose product equals[latex]\,ac\,[/latex]and whose sum equals[latex]\,b.[/latex] Rewrite the equation replacing the[latex]\,bx\,[/latex]term with two terms using the numbers found in step 1 as coefficients of x. Factor the first two terms and then factor the last two terms. The expressions in parentheses must be exactly the same to use grouping. Factor out the expression in parentheses. Set the expressions equal to zero and solve for the variable. Solving a Quadratic Equation Using Grouping Use grouping to factor and solve the quadratic equation:[latex]\,4{x}^{2}+15x+9=0.[/latex] Show Solution First, multiply[latex]\,ac:4\left(9\right)=36.\,[/latex]Then list the factors of[latex]\,36.[/latex] [latex]\begin{array}{l}1\cdot 36\hfill \\ 2\cdot 18\hfill \\ 3\cdot 12\hfill \\ 4\cdot 9\hfill \\ 6\cdot 6\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The only pair of factors that sums to[latex]\,15\,[/latex]is[latex]\,3+12.\,[/latex]Rewrite the equation replacing the b term,[latex]\,15x,[/latex]with two terms using 3 and 12 as coefficients of x. Factor the first two terms, and then factor the last two terms. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill 4{x}^{2}+3x+12x+9& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill x\left(4x+3\right)+3\left(4x+3\right)& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill \left(4x+3\right)\left(x+3\right)& =& 0\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Solve using the zero-product property.

Try It Solve using factoring by grouping:[latex]\,12{x}^{2}+11x+2=0.[/latex] Show Solution [latex]\left(3x+2\right)\left(4x+1\right)=0,[/latex][latex]x=-\frac{2}{3},[/latex][latex]x=-\frac{1}{4}[/latex] Solving a Polynomial of Higher Degree by Factoring Solve the equation by factoring:[latex]\,-3{x}^{3}-5{x}^{2}-2x=0.[/latex] Show Solution This equation does not look like a quadratic, as the highest power is 3, not 2. Recall that the first thing we want to do when solving any equation is to factor out the GCF, if one exists. And it does here. We can factor out[latex]\,-x\,[/latex]from all of the terms and then proceed with grouping. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill -3{x}^{3}-5{x}^{2}-2x& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill -x\left(3{x}^{2}+5x+2\right)& =& 0\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Use grouping on the expression in parentheses.

Notice that we have three factors. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill -x& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill 3x+2& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& -\frac{2}{3}\hfill \\ \hfill x+1& =& 0\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& -1\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The solutions are [latex]\,0,[/latex][latex]-\frac{2}{3},[/latex]and[latex]\,-1.[/latex] Try It Solve by factoring:[latex]\,{x}^{3}+11{x}^{2}+10x=0.[/latex] Show Solution [latex]x=0,x=-10,x=-1[/latex] Using the Square Root Property When there is no linear term in the equation, another method of solving a quadratic equation is by using the square root property, in which we isolate the[latex]\,{x}^{2}\,[/latex]term and take the square root of the number on the other side of the equals sign. Keep in mind that sometimes we may have to manipulate the equation to isolate the[latex]\,{x}^{2}\,[/latex]term so that the square root property can be used. The Square Root Property With the[latex]\,{x}^{2}\,[/latex]term isolated, the square root property states that: [latex]\text{if}\,{x}^{2}=k,\text{then}\,x=±\sqrt{k}[/latex] where k is a nonzero real number. How To Given a quadratic equation with an[latex]\,{x}^{2}\,[/latex]term but no[latex]\,x\,[/latex]term, use the square root property to solve it. Isolate the[latex]\,{x}^{2}\,[/latex]term on one side of the equal sign. Take the square root of both sides of the equation, putting a[latex]\,±\,[/latex]sign before the expression on the side opposite the squared term. Simplify the numbers on the side with the[latex]\,±\,[/latex]sign. Solving a Simple Quadratic Equation Using the Square Root Property Solve the quadratic using the square root property:[latex]\,{x}^{2}=8.[/latex] Show Solution Take the square root of both sides, and then simplify the radical. Remember to use a[latex]\,±\,[/latex]sign before the radical symbol. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill {x}^{2}& =& 8\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& ±\sqrt{8}\hfill \\ & =& ±2\sqrt{2}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The solutions are [latex]\,2\sqrt{2},[/latex][latex]-2\sqrt{2}.[/latex] Solving a Quadratic Equation Using the Square Root Property Solve the quadratic equation:[latex]\,4{x}^{2}+1=\text{7.}[/latex] Show Solution First, isolate the[latex]\,{x}^{2}\,[/latex]term. Then take the square root of both sides. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill 4{x}^{2}+1& =& 7\hfill \\ \hfill 4{x}^{2}& =& 6\hfill \\ \hfill {x}^{2}& =& \frac{6}{4}\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& ±\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The solutions are [latex]\,\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2},[/latex][latex]\text{and}-\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}.[/latex] Try It Solve the quadratic equation using the square root property:[latex]\,3{\left(x-4\right)}^{2}=15.[/latex] Show Solution [latex]x=4±\sqrt{5}[/latex] Completing the Square Not all quadratic equations can be factored or can be solved in their original form using the square root property. In these cases, we may use a method for solving a quadratic equation known as completing the square. Using this method, we add or subtract terms to both sides of the equation until we have a perfect square trinomial on one side of the equal sign. We then apply the square root property. To complete the square, the leading coefficient, a, must equal 1. If it does not, then divide the entire equation by a. Then, we can use the following procedures to solve a quadratic equation by completing the square. We will use the example[latex]\,{x}^{2}+4x+1=0\,[/latex]to illustrate each step. Given a quadratic equation that cannot be factored, and with[latex]\,a=1,[/latex]first add or subtract the constant term to the right sign of the equal sign. [latex]{x}^{2}+4x=-1[/latex] Multiply the b term by[latex]\,\frac{1}{2}\,[/latex]and square it. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \frac{1}{2}\left(4\right)& =& 2\hfill \\ \hfill {2}^{2}& =& 4\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Add[latex]\,{\left(\frac{1}{2}b\right)}^{2}\,[/latex]to both sides of the equal sign and simplify the right side. We have [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill {x}^{2}+4x+4& =& -1+4\hfill \\ \hfill {x}^{2}+4x+4& =& 3\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The left side of the equation can now be factored as a perfect square. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill {x}^{2}+4x+4& =& 3\hfill \\ \hfill {\left(x+2\right)}^{2}& =& 3\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Use the square root property and solve. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \sqrt{{\left(x+2\right)}^{2}}& =& ±\sqrt{3}\hfill \\ \hfill x+2& =& ±\sqrt{3}\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& -2±\sqrt{3}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The solutions are [latex]\,-2+\sqrt{3},[/latex][latex]\text{and}-2-\sqrt{3}.[/latex] Solving a Quadratic by Completing the Square Solve the quadratic equation by completing the square:[latex]\,{x}^{2}-3x-5=0.[/latex] Show Solution First, move the constant term to the right side of the equal sign. [latex]{x}^{2}-3x=5[/latex] Then, take[latex]\,\frac{1}{2}\,[/latex]of the b term and square it. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \frac{1}{2}\left(-3\right)& =& -\frac{3}{2}\hfill \\ \hfill {\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^{2}& =& \frac{9}{4}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Add the result to both sides of the equal sign. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill {x}^{2}-3x+{\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^{2}& =& 5+{\left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^{2}\hfill \\ \hfill {x}^{2}-3x+\frac{9}{4}& =& 5+\frac{9}{4}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Factor the left side as a perfect square and simplify the right side. [latex]{\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^{2}=\frac{29}{4}[/latex] Use the square root property and solve. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill \sqrt{{\left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)}^{2}}& =& ±\sqrt{\frac{29}{4}}\hfill \\ \hfill \left(x-\frac{3}{2}\right)& =& ±\frac{\sqrt{29}}{2}\hfill \\ \hfill x& =& \frac{3}{2}±\frac{\sqrt{29}}{2}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] The solutions are [latex]\,\frac{3}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{29}}{2},[/latex][latex]\text{and}\frac{3}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{29}}{2}.[/latex] Try It Solve by completing the square:[latex]\,{x}^{2}-6x=13.[/latex] Show Solution [latex]x=3±\sqrt{22}[/latex] Using the Quadratic Formula The fourth method of solving a quadratic equation is by using the quadratic formula, a formula that will solve all quadratic equations. Although the quadratic formula works on any quadratic equation in standard form, it is easy to make errors in substituting the values into the formula. Pay close attention when substituting, and use parentheses when inserting a negative number. We can derive the quadratic formula by completing the square. We will assume that the leading coefficient is positive; if it is negative, we can multiply the equation by[latex]\,-1\,[/latex]and obtain a positive a. Given[latex]\,a{x}^{2}+bx+c=0,[/latex][latex]a\ne 0,[/latex]we will complete the square as follows: First, move the constant term to the right side of the equal sign: [latex]a{x}^{2}+bx=-c[/latex] As we want the leading coefficient to equal 1, divide through by a: [latex]{x}^{2}+\frac{b}{a}x=-\frac{c}{a}[/latex] Then, find[latex]\,\frac{1}{2}\,[/latex]of the middle term, and add[latex]\,{\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{b}{a}\right)}^{2}=\frac{{b}^{2}}{4{a}^{2}}\,[/latex]to both sides of the equal sign: [latex]{x}^{2}+\frac{b}{a}x+\frac{{b}^{2}}{4{a}^{2}}=\frac{{b}^{2}}{4{a}^{2}}-\frac{c}{a}[/latex] Next, write the left side as a perfect square. Find the common denominator of the right side and write it as a single fraction: [latex]{\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)}^{2}=\frac{{b}^{2}-4ac}{4{a}^{2}}[/latex] Now, use the square root property, which gives [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill x+\frac{b}{2a}& =& ±\sqrt{\frac{{b}^{2}-4ac}{4{a}^{2}}}\hfill \\ \hfill x+\frac{b}{2a}& =& \frac{±\sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Finally, add[latex]\,-\frac{b}{2a}\,[/latex]to both sides of the equation and combine the terms on the right side. Thus, [latex]x=\frac{-b±\sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a}[/latex] The Quadratic Formula Written in standard form,[latex]\,a{x}^{2}+bx+c=0,[/latex]any quadratic equation can be solved using the quadratic formula: [latex]x=\frac{-b±\sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a}[/latex] where a, b, and c are real numbers and[latex]\,a\ne 0.[/latex] How To Given a quadratic equation, solve it using the quadratic formula Make sure the equation is in standard form:[latex]\,a{x}^{2}+bx+c=0.[/latex] Make note of the values of the coefficients and constant term,[latex]\,a,b,[/latex]and[latex]\,c.[/latex] Carefully substitute the values noted in step 2 into the equation. To avoid needless errors, use parentheses around each number input into the formula. Calculate and solve. Solve the Quadratic Equation Using the Quadratic Formula Solve the quadratic equation:[latex]\,{x}^{2}+5x+1=0.[/latex] Show Solution Identify the coefficients:[latex]\,a=1,b=5,c=1.\,[/latex]Then use the quadratic formula. [latex]\begin{array}{ccc}\hfill x& =& \hfill \frac{-\left(5\right)±\sqrt{{\left(5\right)}^{2}-4\left(1\right)\left(1\right)}}{2\left(1\right)}\\ & =& \frac{-5±\sqrt{25-4}}{2}\hfill \\ & =& \frac{-5±\sqrt{21}}{2}\hfill \end{array}[/latex] Solving a Quadratic Equation with the Quadratic Formula Use the quadratic formula to solve[latex]\,{x}^{2}+x+2=0.[/latex] Show Solution First, we identify the coefficients:[latex]\,a=1,b=1,[/latex]and[latex]\,c=2.[/latex] Substitute these values into the quadratic formula.

Using the Discriminant to Find the Nature of the Solutions to a Quadratic Equation Use the discriminant to find the nature of the solutions to the following quadratic equations: [latex]{x}^{2}+4x+4=0[/latex] [latex]8{x}^{2}+14x+3=0[/latex] [latex]3{x}^{2}-5x-2=0[/latex] [latex]3{x}^{2}-10x+15=0[/latex] Show Solution Calculate the discriminant[latex]\,{b}^{2}-4ac\,[/latex]for each equation and state the expected type of solutions.

Using the Pythagorean Theorem One of the most famous formulas in mathematics is the Pythagorean Theorem. It is based on a right triangle, and states the relationship among the lengths of the sides as[latex]\,{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}={c}^{2},[/latex]where[latex]\,a\,[/latex]and[latex]\,b\,[/latex]refer to the legs of a right triangle adjacent to the[latex]\,90°\,[/latex]angle, and[latex]\,c\,[/latex]refers to the hypotenuse. It has immeasurable uses in architecture, engineering, the sciences, geometry, trigonometry, and algebra, and in everyday applications. We use the Pythagorean Theorem to solve for the length of one side of a triangle when we have the lengths of the other two. Because each of the terms is squared in the theorem, when we are solving for a side of a triangle, we have a quadratic equation. We can use the methods for solving quadratic equations that we learned in this section to solve for the missing side. The Pythagorean Theorem is given as [latex]{a}^{2}+{b}^{2}={c}^{2}[/latex] where[latex]\,a\,[/latex]and[latex]\,b\,[/latex]refer to the legs of a right triangle adjacent to the[latex]\,{90}^{\circ }\,[/latex]angle, and[latex]\,c\,[/latex]refers to the hypotenuse, as shown in .

Key Equations quadratic formula [latex]x=\frac{-b±\sqrt{{b}^{2}-4ac}}{2a}[/latex] Key Concepts Many quadratic equations can be solved by factoring when the equation has a leading coefficient of 1 or if the equation is a difference of squares. The zero-factor property is then used to find solutions. See , , and . Many quadratic equations with a leading coefficient other than 1 can be solved by factoring using the grouping method. See and . Another method for solving quadratics is the square root property. The variable is squared. We isolate the squared term and take the square root of both sides of the equation. The solution will yield a positive and negative solution. See and . Completing the square is a method of solving quadratic equations when the equation cannot be factored. See . A highly dependable method for solving quadratic equations is the quadratic formula, based on the coefficients and the constant term in the equation. See . The discriminant is used to indicate the nature of the roots that the quadratic equation will yield: real or complex, rational or irrational, and how many of each. See . The Pythagorean Theorem, among the most famous theorems in history, is used to solve right-triangle problems and has applications in numerous fields. Solving for the length of one side of a right triangle requires solving a quadratic equation. See . Section Exercises Verbal How do we recognize when an equation is quadratic?

Trigonometric proof using the law of cosines[] A modern proof, which uses and is quite different from the one provided by Heron, follows. Let a, b, c be the sides of the triangle and α, β, γ the opposite those sides. Applying the we get cos ⁡ γ = a 2 + b 2 − c 2 2 a b {\displaystyle \cos \gamma ={\frac {a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2}}{2ab}}} From this proof, we get the algebraic statement that sin ⁡ γ = 1 − cos 2 ⁡ γ = 4 a 2 b 2 − ( a 2 + b 2 − c 2 ) 2 2 a b . {\displaystyle \sin \gamma ={\sqrt {1-\cos ^{2}\gamma }}={\frac {\sqrt {4a^{2}b^{2}-(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2})^{2}}}{2ab}}.} The of the triangle on base a has length b sin γ, and it follows A = 1 2 ( base ) ( altitude ) = 1 2 a b sin ⁡ γ = a b 4 a b 4 a 2 b 2 − ( a 2 + b 2 − c 2 ) 2 = 1 4 − a 4 − b 4 − c 4 + 2 a 2 b 2 + 2 a 2 c 2 + 2 b 2 c 2 = 1 4 ( a + b + c ) ( − a + b + c ) ( a − b + c ) ( a + b − c ) = ( a + b + c 2 ) ( − a + b + c 2 ) ( a − b + c 2 ) ( a + b − c 2 ) = s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&={\tfrac {1}{2}}({\mbox{base}})({\mbox{altitude}})\\[6mu]&={\tfrac {1}{2}}ab\sin \gamma \\[6mu]&={\frac {ab}{4ab}}{\sqrt {4a^{2}b^{2}-(a^{2}+b^{2}-c^{2})^{2}}}\\[6mu]&={\tfrac {1}{4}}{\sqrt {-a^{4}-b^{4}-c^{4}+2a^{2}b^{2}+2a^{2}c^{2}+2b^{2}c^{2}}}\\[6mu]&={\tfrac {1}{4}}{\sqrt {(a+b+c)(-a+b+c)(a-b+c)(a+b-c)}}\\[6mu]&={\sqrt {\left({\frac {a+b+c}{2}}\right)\left({\frac {-a+b+c}{2}}\right)\left({\frac {a-b+c}{2}}\right)\left({\frac {a+b-c}{2}}\right)}}\\[6mu]&={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}.\end{aligned}}} Algebraic proof using the Pythagorean theorem[] Triangle with altitude h cutting base c into d + (c − d) The following proof is very similar to one given by Raifaizen. By the we have b2 = h2 + d2 and a2 = h2 + (c − d)2 according to the figure at the right. Subtracting these yields a2 − b2 = c2 − 2cd. This equation allows us to express d in terms of the sides of the triangle: d = − a 2 + b 2 + c 2 2 c . {\displaystyle d={\frac {-a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}{2c}}.} For the height of the triangle we have that h2 = b2 − d2. By replacing d with the formula given above and applying the identity we get h 2 = b 2 − ( − a 2 + b 2 + c 2 2 c ) 2 = ( 2 b c − a 2 + b 2 + c 2 ) ( 2 b c + a 2 − b 2 − c 2 ) 4 c 2 = ( ( b + c ) 2 − a 2 ) ( a 2 − ( b − c ) 2 ) 4 c 2 = ( b + c − a ) ( b + c + a ) ( a + b − c ) ( a − b + c ) 4 c 2 = 2 ( s − a ) ⋅ 2 s ⋅ 2 ( s − c ) ⋅ 2 ( s − b ) 4 c 2 = 4 s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) c 2 . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}h^{2}&=b^{2}-\left({\frac {-a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}}{2c}}\right)^{2}\\&={\frac {(2bc-a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2})(2bc+a^{2}-b^{2}-c^{2})}{4c^{2}}}\\&={\frac {{\big (}(b+c)^{2}-a^{2}{\big )}{\big (}a^{2}-(b-c)^{2}{\big )}}{4c^{2}}}\\&={\frac {(b+c-a)(b+c+a)(a+b-c)(a-b+c)}{4c^{2}}}\\&={\frac {2(s-a)\cdot 2s\cdot 2(s-c)\cdot 2(s-b)}{4c^{2}}}\\&={\frac {4s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{c^{2}}}.\end{aligned}}} We now apply this result to the formula that calculates the area of a triangle from its height: A = c h 2 = c 2 4 ⋅ 4 s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) c 2 = s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&={\frac {ch}{2}}\\&={\sqrt {{\frac {c^{2}}{4}}\cdot {\frac {4s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{c^{2}}}}}\\&={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}.\end{aligned}}} Trigonometric proof using the law of cotangents[] Geometrical significance of s − a, s − b, and s − c. See the for the reasoning behind this. If r is the radius of the of the triangle, then the triangle can be broken into three triangles of equal altitude r and bases a, b, and c. Their combined area is A = 1 2 a r + 1 2 b r + 1 2 c r = r s , {\displaystyle A={\tfrac {1}{2}}ar+{\tfrac {1}{2}}br+{\tfrac {1}{2}}cr=rs,} where s = 1 2 ( a + b + c ) {\textstyle s={\tfrac {1}{2}}(a+b+c)} is the semiperimeter. The triangle can alternately be broken into six triangles (in congruent pairs) of altitude r and bases s − a, s − b, and s − c, of combined area (see ) A = r ( s − a ) + r ( s − b ) + r ( s − c ) = r 2 ( s − a r + s − b r + s − c r ) = r 2 ( cot ⁡ α 2 + cot ⁡ β 2 + cot ⁡ γ 2 ) = r 2 ( cot ⁡ α 2 cot ⁡ β 2 cot ⁡ γ 2 ) = r 2 ( s − a r ⋅ s − b r ⋅ s − c r ) = ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) r . {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&=r(s-a)+r(s-b)+r(s-c)\\[2mu]&=r^{2}\left({\frac {s-a}{r}}+{\frac {s-b}{r}}+{\frac {s-c}{r}}\right)\\[2mu]&=r^{2}\left(\cot {\frac {\alpha }{2}}+\cot {\frac {\beta }{2}}+\cot {\frac {\gamma }{2}}\right)\\[3mu]&=r^{2}\left(\cot {\frac {\alpha }{2}}\cot {\frac {\beta }{2}}\cot {\frac {\gamma }{2}}\right)\\[3mu]&=r^{2}\left({\frac {s-a}{r}}\cdot {\frac {s-b}{r}}\cdot {\frac {s-c}{r}}\right)\\[3mu]&={\frac {(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{r}}.\end{aligned}}} The middle step above is cot ⁡ α 2 + cot ⁡ β 2 + cot ⁡ γ 2 = cot ⁡ α 2 cot ⁡ β 2 cot ⁡ γ 2 , {\textstyle \cot {\tfrac {\alpha }{2}}+\cot {\tfrac {\beta }{2}}+\cot {\tfrac {\gamma }{2}}=\cot {\tfrac {\alpha }{2}}\cot {\tfrac {\beta }{2}}\cot {\tfrac {\gamma }{2}},} the , which applies because the sum of half-angles is α 2 + β 2 + γ 2 = π 2 . {\textstyle {\tfrac {\alpha }{2}}+{\tfrac {\beta }{2}}+{\tfrac {\gamma }{2}}={\tfrac {\pi }{2}}.} Combining the two, we get A 2 = s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) , {\displaystyle A^{2}=s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c),} from which the result follows. Numerical stability[] Heron's formula as given above is for triangles with a very small angle when using . A stable alternative involves arranging the lengths of the sides so that a ≥ b ≥ c and computing A = 1 4 ( a + ( b + c ) ) ( c − ( a − b ) ) ( c + ( a − b ) ) ( a + ( b − c ) ) . {\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{4}}{\sqrt {{\big (}a+(b+c){\big )}{\big (}c-(a-b){\big )}{\big (}c+(a-b){\big )}{\big (}a+(b-c){\big )}}}.} The brackets in the above formula are required in order to prevent numerical instability in the evaluation.

This formula is also used to find the area of the quadrilateral, by dividing the into two triangles, along its diagonal. If a, b and c are the three sides of a triangle, respectively, then Heron’s formula is given by: \(\begin{array}{l}Area~of~triangle~using~three~sides =\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\end{array} \) Semiperimeter, s = Perimeter of triangle/2 = (a+b+c)/2 History of Heron’s Formula Hero of Alexandria was a great mathematician who derived the formula for the calculation of the area of a triangle using the length of all three sides. He also extended this idea to find the area of quadrilateral and also higher-order polygons. This formula has its huge applications in trigonometry such as proving the law of cosines or the law of cotangents, etc. Heron’s Formula for Triangles According to Heron, we can find the area of any given triangle, whether it is a scalene, isosceles or equilateral, by using the formula, provided the sides of the triangle. Suppose, a triangle ABC, whose sides are a, b and c, respectively. Thus, the area of a triangle can be given by; \(\begin{array}{l}Area =\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\end{array} \) Where “s” is semi-perimeter = (a+b+c) / 2 And a, b, c are the three sides of the triangle. Proof of Heron’s Formula There are two methods by which we can derive Heron’s formula. First, by using trigonometric identities and cosine rule. Secondly, solving algebraic expressions using the Pythagoras theorem. Let us see one by one both the proofs or derivation. Using Cosine Rule Let us prove the result using the law of cosines: Let a, b, c be the sides of the triangle and α, β, γ are opposite angles to the sides. We know that, the law of cosines is \(\begin{array}{l} cos \gamma =\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab}\end{array} \) Again, using trig identity, we have \(\begin{array}{l}sin \gamma = \sqrt{1-cos^2γ} \end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}= \frac{\sqrt{4a^2b^2-(a^2+b^2-c^2)^2}}{2ab}\end{array} \) Here, Base of triangle = a Altitude = b sinγ Now, Using Pythagoras Theorem Area of a Triangle with 3 Sides Area of ∆ABC is given by A = 1/2 bh _ _ _ _ (i) Draw a perpendicular BD on AC Consider a ∆ADB x2 + h2 = c2 x2 = c2 − h2—(ii) ⇒ x = √(c2−h2)−−−−−−—(iii) Consider a ∆CDB, (b−x)2 + h2 = a2 (b−x)2 = a2 − h2 b2 − 2bx + x2 = a2–h2 Substituting the value of x and x2 from equation (ii) and (iii), we get b2 – 2b√(c2−h2)+ c2−h2 = a2 − h2 b2 + c2 − a2 = 2b√(c2 − h2) Squaring on both sides, we get; (b2+c2–a2)2 = 4b2(c2−h2) \(\begin{array}{l}\frac{(b^2 + c^2 -a^2 )^2}{4b^2} = c^2 – h^2\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~ = ~c^2 ~-~\frac{(b^2 +c^2 -a^2 )^2}{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~ =~\frac{4b^2 c^2 – (b^2 +c^2 -a^2 )^2 }{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~=~\frac{(2bc)^2 -(b^2+c^2- a^2 )^2}{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~=~\frac{[2bc+(b^2 +c^2 -a^2 )][2bc-(b^2+c^2-a^2)]} {4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~ =~\frac{[(b^2+2bc+c^2)-a^2][a^2-(b^2- 2bc+c^2)]}{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~=~\frac{[(b+c)^2 – a^2 ].[a^2 -(b-c)^2 ]}{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~=~\frac{[(b+c)+a][(b+c)-a].[a+(b-c)][a-(b-c)]}{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}h^2~=~\frac{(a+b+c)(b+c-a)(a+c-b)(a+b-c)}{4b^2}\end{array} \) The perimeter of a ∆ABC is given by: P = a + b + c Thus, substituting a + b + c = P in the above equation, we get; \(\begin{array}{l}⇒~h^2~ =~\frac{P(P – 2a)(P – 2b)(P -2c)}{4b^2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}⇒~h~ = \frac{\sqrt{P(P – 2a)(P – 2b)(P -2c)}}{{2b}}\end{array} \) Substituting the value of h in equation (i), we get; \(\begin{array}{l}A~=~\frac{1}{2} b \frac{\sqrt{P(P – 2a)(P – 2b)(P -2c)}}{2b}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}A~=~\frac{1}{4}\sqrt{(P(P – 2a)(P – 2b)(P -2c)}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}A~=~\sqrt{\frac{1}{16} P(P – 2a)(P – 2b)(P -2c)}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}A~=~\sqrt{\frac{P}{2}\left(\frac{P – 2a}{2}\right)\left(\frac{P – 2b}{2}\right)\left(\frac{P -2c}{2}\right)}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}Semi\ perimeter(s) =\frac{perimeter}{2}~=~\frac{P}{2}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}~A~=~\sqrt{s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)}\end{array} \) Note: Heron’s formula is applicable to all types of triangles and the formula can also be derived using the law of cosines and the law of Cotangents. How to Find the Area Using Heron’s Formula? To find the area of a triangle using Heron’s formula, we have to follow two steps: Find the perimeter of the given triangle Then, find the value of the semi-perimeter of the given triangle; s = (a + b + c)/2 Now use Heron’s formula to find the area of a triangle (√(s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c))) Finally, represent the area with the accurate square units (such as m2, cm2, in2, etc.) Heron’s Formula for Equilateral Triangle As we know the equilateral triangle has all its sides equal. To find the area of the equilateral triangle let us first find the semi perimeter of the equilateral triangle will be: s = (a + a + a)/2 s = 3a/2 where a is the length of the side. Now, as per the heron’s formula, we know; \(\begin{array}{l}Area =\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\end{array} \) Since, a = b = c Therefore, A = √[s(s – a)3] which is the required formula. Heron’s Formula for Isosceles Triangle An isosceles triangle has two of its sides equal and the angles corresponding to these sides are congruent. To find the area of an isosceles triangle, we can derive the heron’s formula as given below: Let a be the length of the congruent sides and b be the length of the base. Semi-perimeter (s) = (a + a + b)/2 s = (2a + b)/2 Using the heron’s formula of a triangle, Area = √[s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)] By substituting the sides of an isosceles triangle, Area = √[s(s – a)(s – a)(s – b)] = √[s(s – a)2(s – b)] Or = (s – a)√[s(s – b)] which is the required formula to find the area for the given isosceles triangle. Heron’s Formula for Scalene Triangle As we know, a scalene triangle has all three unequal sides, thus, we can directly use the original Heron’s formula to find the area. Area of scalene triangle = √s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c), where s = (a + b + c)/2 Heron’s Formula For Quadrilateral Let us learn how to find the area of quadrilateral using Heron’s formula here. If ABCD is a quadrilateral, where AB||CD and AC & BD are the diagonals. AC divides the quad.ABCD into two triangles ADC and ABC. Now we have two triangles here. Area of quad.ABCD = Area of ∆ADC + Area of ∆ABC So, if we know the lengths of all sides of a quadrilateral and the length of diagonal AC, then we can use Heron’s formula to find the total area. Hence, we will first find the area of ∆ADC and area of ∆ABC using Heron’s formula and at last, will add them to get the final value. Applications of Heron’s Formula The two major applications of Heron’s formula are: To find the area of different types of a triangle (when the length of three sides are given) To find the area of a quadrilateral (when the length of all three sides are given) Solved Examples Let us now look into some examples to have a brief insight into the topic: Example 1: Find the area of a trapezium, the length of whose parallel sides is given as 22 cm and 12 cm and the length of other sides is 14 cm each. Solution: Let PQRS be the given trapezium in which PQ = 22 cm, SR = 12 cm, PS = QR = 14 cm. Constructions: Draw OR||PS Now, PORS is a parallelogram in which PS||OR and PO||SR Therefore, PO = SR = 12 cm ⇒ OQ = PQ – PO = 22 – 12 = 10 cm In ∆OQR , we have \(\begin{array}{l}s~ = ~\frac{14+14+10}{2}~ =~\frac{38}{2}~=~19\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\text {Area of ∆OQR} =\sqrt{s(s – a)(s – b)(s –C)}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l} =\sqrt{ (19(19 – 14)(19 – 14)(19 –10))}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l} = \sqrt{4275}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}= 15 \sqrt{19} cm^2 ………(i)\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\text{We know that Area} =\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\Rightarrow 15\sqrt{19} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times h\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\Rightarrow h = 5\sqrt{19} …………..(ii)\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\text{Area of trapezium} = \frac{1}{2}~ (PQ+SR) × h \end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}=\frac{1}{2}(22+12) × 3 \sqrt{19} \end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}=51 \sqrt{19} cm^2\end{array} \) Example 2: Find the area of the triangle whose sides measure 10 cm, 17 cm and 21 cm. Also, determine the length of the altitude on the side which measures 17 cm. Solution: \(\begin{array}{l} s = \frac{a+b+c}{2} =\frac{10+17+21}{2}= 24\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\text{Area of Triangle} =\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\sqrt{24 \times 14 \times 7 \times 3}\end{array} \) \(\begin{array}{l}\sqrt{7056}= 84 \ square\ cm\end{array} \) Taking 17 cm as the base length we need to find the height Area, A = 1/2 × base × height 1/2 × 17 × h = 84 or h = 168/17 = 9.88 cm (Rounded to the nearest hundredth). Example 3: A triangle PQR has sides 4 cm, 13 cm and 15 cm. Find the area of the triangle. Solution: Semiperimeter of triangle PQR, s = (4 + 13 + 15)/2 = 32/2 = 16 By heron’s formula, we know; A = √[s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)] Hence, A = √[16(16 – 4)(16 – 13)(16 – 15)] = √(16 × 12 × 3 × 1) = √576 = 24 sq.cm Heron’s Formula – Practice Questions A few practice questions are given below that will help you in improving your knowledge of how to find the area of a given triangle.

Then you get a negative value for the square root which means there is an imaginary result for the area. This cannot be correct. How is this resolved? lavanya Sides of a triangle is less than the semi-perimeter of triangle. As we know, the sum of two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third side. Let a,b and c are three sides of a triangle. Hence, a < b + c Add a on both the sides. a+a < a+b+c 2a < a+b+c a<(a+b+c)/2 (a+b+c)/2 = semi perimeter You can also repeat the same for sides b and c. Thus, you will get; b<(a+b+c)/2 c<(a+b+c)/2 Therefore, semiperimeter is always greater than sides of the triangle and we cannot get any negative value under the root in Heron's formula.

0,cuemath,Heron's Formula: Area of a Triangle | Free Homework Help,https://www.cuemath.com/herons-formula/,"Heron's Formula? Heron's formula is used to determine the area of when lengths of all their sides are given or to find the area of . We also know it as Hero's formula. This formula for finding the area does not depend on the angles of a triangle. It solely depends on the lengths of all sides of triangles. It contains the term ""s"" which is known as semi-perimeter, which is obtained by halving the of a triangle. Similarly, this concept of finding the area is further extended to determine the area of quadrilaterals as well. History of Heron's Formula Heron's formula was written in 60 CE by Heron of Alexandria. He was a Greek Engineer and Mathematician who determined the value of the area of the triangle using only the lengths of its sides and further extended it to calculate areas of quadrilaterals. He used this formula to prove the trigonometric laws such as or Laws of cotangents. Heron's Formula Definition As per Heron's formula, the value of the area of any triangle having lengths, a, b, c, perimeter of the triangle, P, and semi-perimeter of the triangle as 's' is determined using the below-given formula: Area of triangle ABC = √s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where s = Perimeter/2 = (a + b + c)/2 Example: Find the area of a triangle whose lengths are 5 units, 6 units, and 9 units respectively. Solution: As we know, a = 5 units, b = 6 units and c = 9 units Thus, Semi-perimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2 = (5 + 6 + 9)/2 = 10 units Area of triangle = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = √(10(10-5)(10-6)(10-9)) ⇒ Area of triangle = √(10 × 5 × 4 × 1) = √200 = 14.142 unit2 ∴ The area of the triangle is 14.142 unit2 Heron's Formula for Area of Triangle Proof We will use some , formula, and to derive Heron's formula. Let us take a triangle having lengths of sides, a, b, and c. Let the semi-perimeter of the triangle ABC be ""s"", the perimeter of the triangle ABC is ""P"" and the area of triangle ABC is ""A"". Let us assume the side length b is divided into two parts p and q as a perpendicular(h) falls from the vertex B on the side AC at point M. Consider the triangle below: As we know, the area of a triangle = (1/2) b × h where b is the base and h is the height of the triangle. Let us begin to calculate the value of h. Thus, as per the image, b = p + q ⇒ q = b - p ....(1) On squaring both sides we get, ⇒ q2 = b2 + p2 - 2bp ....(2) Adding h2 on both sides we get, q2 + h2 = b2 + p2 - 2bp + h2 ....(3) Applying Pythagoras Theorem in the triangle BCM we get, h2 + q2 = a2 ....(4) Applying Pythagoras Theorem in the triangle MBA we get, p2 + h2 = c2 ....(5) Substituting the value of (4) and (5) in (3) we get, q2 + h2 = b2 + p2 - 2bp + h2 ⇒ a2 = b2 + c2 - 2bp ⇒ p = (b2 + c2 - a2)/2b ....(6) From (5) p2 + h2 = c2 ⇒ h2 = c2 - p2 = (c + p) (c - p) ....(7) (As a2 - b2 = (a+b)(a-b)) Substituting (6) in (7) we get, h2 = (c + p) (c - p) ⇒ h2 = (c + (b2 + c2 - a2)/2b) (c - (b2 + c2 - a2)/2b) ⇒ h2 = ((2bc + b2 + c2 - a2)/2b) ((2bc - b2 - c2 + a2)/2b) ⇒ h2 = ((b + c)2 - a2)/2b) ((a2 - (b - c)2)/2b) ⇒ h2 = ((b + c + a)(b + c - a)(a + b - c)(a - b + c))/4b2) ....(8) (As a2 - b2 = (a+b)(a-b)) As perimeter of triangle is P = a + b + c and P = 2s. (Here s = semi-perimeter and s = P/2) ∴ 2s = a + b + c ....(9) Substituting (9) in (8) we get, h2 = ((b + c + a)(b + c - a)(a + b - c)(a - b + c))/4b2) ⇒ h2 = (2s × (2s - 2a) × (2s - 2b) × (2s - 2c))/4b2) ⇒ h2 = (2s × 2(s - a) × 2(s - b) × 2(s - c))/4b2) ⇒ h2 = 16s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)/4b2 ⇒ h = √(4s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)/b2) ⇒ h = 2√(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))/b ....(10) Area of triangle ABC, A = (1/2) × base × height ⇒ A = (1/2) × b × h ⇒ A = (1/2) × b × 2√(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c))/b (From (10)) ⇒ A = √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) ∴ Area of the triangle ABC = √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)) unit2 Area of Triangle By Heron's Formula? The steps to determine the area using Heron's formula are: Step 1: Find the perimeter of the given triangle. Step 2: Find the semi-perimeter by halving the perimeter. Step 3: Find the area of the triangle using Heron's formula √(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)). Step 4: Once the value is determined, write the unit at the end (For example, m2, cm2, or in2). Heron's Formula for Equilateral Triangle An has all sides of the same length. Thus, in this case, the lengths of all sides are equal. Let us assume the length of all sides is ""a"", semi-perimeter is ""s"" and the area of the equilateral triangle is ""A"". Thus, the semi-perimeter of the triangle is s = (a + a + a)/2 = 3a/2 Area of the equilateral triangle, A = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = √((3a/2)((3a/2)-a)((3a/2)-a)((3a/2)-a)) ⇒ A = √((3a/2)(3a/2-a)3) = √((3a/2)(a/2)3) ⇒ A = √((3a × a3)/2 × 8) = √(3a4/16) = (√3 × a2)/4 Heron's Formula for Scalene Triangle A has all lengths of different sides. Let us assume the length of sides is a, b, c, semi-perimeter is ""s"" and the area of the scalene triangle is ""A"". Area of scalene triangle = √s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c), where s = (a + b + c)/2 Heron's Formula for Isosceles Triangle An has two sides of equal length. Let us assume the length of the two sides is a and one side is b, semi-perimeter is ""s"" and the area of the isosceles triangle is ""A"". Thus, the semi-perimeter of the triangle is s = (a + a + b)/2 = (a+b/2) Area of the isosceles triangle, A = √(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = √(a+b/2)((a+b/2)-a)((a+b/2)-a)((a+b/2)-b)) ⇒ A = √(a+b/2)((b/2)(b/2)(a-b/2))= √((a2 - (b/2)2)(b/2)2) ⇒ A = √(a2 - (b2/4))× (b2/4)) = (b/4)√(4a2- b2) Heron's Formula for Area of Quadrilateral We can use Heron's formula to determine the formula for the by dividing it into two triangles. Let us say we have a quadrilateral ABCD with the length of its sides measuring a, b, c, and d. Let us say A and B are joined to show the diagonal of the quadrilateral having length e. The area of triangle ADC = √(s(s - a)(s - d)(s - e)), where s = (a + d + e)/2 The area of triangle ABC = √(s'(s' - b)(s' - c)(s' - e)), where s' = (b + c + e)/2 Thus, area of quadrilateral ABCD = Area of triangle ADC + Area of triangle ABC ⇒ Area of quadrilateral ABCD = √(s(s - a)(s - d)(s - e)) + √(s'(s' - b)(s' - c)(s' - e)) Applications of Heron's Formula Heron's formula has numerous applications. They are: It can be used to determine the area of different types of triangles if the lengths of their different sides are given. It can be used to find the area of the quadrilateral if the lengths of all its sides are given. Application of Heron's Formula in Finding Area of Quadrilateral The application of Heron's formula in finding the area of the quadrilateral is that it can be used to determine the area of any irregular quadrilateral by converting the quadrilateral into triangles. Important Notes on Heron's Formula Heron's formula is used to find the area of a triangle when all its sides are given. We can use heron's formula to find the area of the quadrilateral by dividing it into two triangles. The formula uses the semi-perimeter and side of lengths of a triangle.

For a triangle having three sides, a, b, and c, semi-perimeter, s, and area of triangle A, the semi-perimeter and area of the triangle are given as (a + b + c)/2 and √s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) respectively.How Does Heron's Formula Work?The heron's formula depends only on the semi-perimeter of a triangle and the length of its three sides. We first determine the value of the semi-perimeter using the lengths of three sides of the triangle. Once the value of the semi-perimeter is obtained we can find the area of the shape.Who Discovered Heron's Formula?Heron's Formula was discovered by Heron of Alexandria (also known as Hero of Alexandria) who was a Greek Engineer and Mathematician. He found the area of the triangle using only the lengths of its sides which made it possible to apply to any type of triangle be it, equilateral, isosceles, or scalene. This formula was further extended by him to calculate areas of quadrilaterals and proved the trigonometric laws such as Laws of cosines or Laws of cotangents.What Does S Stand for in Heron's Formula?S stands for semi-perimeter in Heron's formula. It is obtained by halving the value of the perimeter.Can We Use Heron's Formula In Equilateral Triangle?Yes, we can use Heron's formula in an equilateral triangle. The area of an equilateral triangle is given as (√3 × a2)/4 unit2.How to Derive Heron's Formula?We can derive Heron's"

The formula we choose will depend on the information that we have about the triangle.Recall that, to calculate the area of any triangle that has a known base length and perpendicular height, we can use the formula 𝐴=12𝑏ℎ, where 𝑏 is the base length and ℎ is the perpendicular height. To find the area of the triangle below, we can substitute 12 cm into this formula for 𝑏 and 4 cm for ℎ: 𝐴=12(4)(12)=24.cmAlso remember that 𝐴=12𝑎𝑏𝐶sin is another formula we can use to calculate a triangle’s area. In it, 𝑎 and 𝑏 are the lengths of two of the triangle’s sides, and 𝐶 is the measure of the included angle, or the angle formed by the sides with lengths 𝑎 and 𝑏.We can use this formula to find the area of any triangle that has an angle with a known measure and that is formed by two sides with known lengths. To find the area of the following triangle, we can substitute 15 cm and 18 cm into the formula for 𝑎 and 𝑏 and 30∘ for 𝐶: 𝐴=12(15)(18)(30)=12(15)(18)12=67.5.sincm∘Now, suppose that we know the lengths of all three sides of a triangle but the measures of none of its angles. With only this information, we can use neither the formula 𝐴=12𝑏ℎ nor the formula 𝐴=12𝑎𝑏𝐶sin to calculate the triangle’s area. However, we can use Heron’s formula.Definition: Heron’s FormulaHeron’s formula states that the area, 𝐴, of a triangle with side lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐), where 𝑠 is the semiperimeter of the triangle, or half its perimeter. The triangle’s semiperimeter is given by the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2.Let’s test Heron’s formula to make sure that we get the same area, 𝐴, for an equilateral triangle with a side length of 2 cm that we get when using the formula 𝐴=√34𝑎.In this formula, the variable 𝑎 is the triangle’s side length. Substituting 𝑎=2 into this formula gives us 𝐴=√34(2)=√34(4)=√3.cmWe get √3 cm2 for the triangle’s area. To make our comparison, we will now use Heron’s formula to find the area. To do this, first, we will need to calculate the semiperimeter: 𝑠=2+2+22=62=3.cmHeron’s formula then gives us 𝐴=√3(3−2)(3−2)(3−2)=√3(1)(1)(1)=√3.cmWe see that the triangle’s area is √3 cm2, the same answer that we arrived at previously. This is what we would expect.In the examples that follow, we will look at some other instances in which Heron’s formula is used to calculate not only the areas of triangles but also the areas of figures composed of triangles.Example 1: Finding the Area of a Triangle Using Heron’s FormulaThe area of the triangle whose side lengths are 3 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm equals cm2.Answer In this problem, we are given only the three side lengths of a triangle. Since we are given neither the triangle’s height nor any of its angle measures, we must use Heron’s formula to find its area. Recall that Heron’s formula states that the area, 𝐴, of a triangle with side lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐), where 𝑠 is the triangle’s semiperimeter, or half its perimeter. The semiperimeter can be found using the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2.Let’s begin by finding the triangle’s semiperimeter. We must substitute each of the triangle’s side lengths into the semiperimeter formula for either 𝑎, 𝑏, or 𝑐. It does not matter which side length we substitute for which variable. Here, we will substitute 𝑎=3, 𝑏=6, and 𝑐=7 and then simplify to get a semiperimeter of 𝑠=3+6+72=162=8.cmNow, we can substitute values into Heron’s formula to find the triangle’s area.Since 𝑎=3, 𝑏=6, 𝑐=7, and 𝑠=8, Heron’s formula gives us 𝐴=√8(8−3)(8−6)(8−7)=√8(5)(2)(1)=√80=4√5.cmThus, we can say that the area of the triangle whose side lengths are 3 cm, 6 cm, and 7 cm is 4√5 cm2.In the next example, we will also calculate the area of a triangle with three given side lengths using Heron’s formula.Example 2: Finding the Area of a Triangle Using Heron’s Formula𝐴𝐵𝐶 is a triangle, where 𝐵𝐶=28cm, 𝐴𝐶=20cm, and 𝐴𝐵=24cm. Find the area of 𝐴𝐵𝐶 giving the answer to the nearest square centimetre.Answer First, let’s draw a sketch of triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶. We are told that 𝐵𝐶=28cm, 𝐴𝐶=20cm, and 𝐴𝐵=24cm.Since we know the triangle’s three side lengths, we can use Heron’s formula to find its area. According to Heron’s formula, the area, 𝐴, of a triangle with side lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐), where 𝑠 is the triangle’s semiperimeter. The semiperimeter can be calculated using the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2.Substituting 𝑎=28, 𝑏=20, and 𝑐=24 into the semiperimeter formula gives us 𝑠=28+20+242=722=36.cmNow, since 𝑎=28, 𝑏=20, 𝑐=24, and 𝑠=36, Heron’s formula tells us that the triangle’s area is 𝐴=√36(36−28)(36−20)(36−24)=√36(8)(16)(12)=√55296=235.151015….cmThe area of triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶 to the nearest square centimetre is 235 cm2.Next, we will use Heron’s formula to calculate the area of a rhombus. Remember that the sides of a rhombus all have the same length.Example 3: Finding the Area of a Rhombus Using Heron’s FormulaThe perimeter of the given rhombus is 292 cm and the length of 𝐴𝐶 is 116 cm. Use Heron’s formula to calculate the area of the rhombus, giving the answer to three decimal places.Answer Recall that Heron’s formula is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐), where 𝐴 is the area of a triangle that has sides with lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 and a semiperimeter of 𝑠. The semiperimeter is given by the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2.In order to use Heron’s formula to calculate the area of the given rhombus, we must decompose the rhombus into two triangles: triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶 and triangle 𝐴𝐷𝐶. Since a rhombus is a quadrilateral that has four sides of equal length, each of the sides of rhombus 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷 must have a length of 2924=73.cmTherefore, we know that the lengths of the sides of triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶 are 𝐴𝐵=73,𝐵𝐶=73,𝐴𝐶=116.cmcmandcmWith this information, we can use Heron’s formula to calculate the triangle’s area. We can begin by finding its semiperimeter: 𝑠=73+116+732=2622=131.cmNext, we can substitute 𝑎=73, 𝑏=116, 𝑐=73, and 𝑠=131 into Heron’s formula to get an area of 𝐴=√131(131−73)(131−116)(131−73)=√131(58)(15)(58)=√6610260.cmWe know that triangle 𝐴𝐷𝐶 must have the same area as triangle 𝐴𝐵𝐶, because the two triangles have the same side lengths. Therefore, since rhombus 𝐴𝐵𝐶𝐷 is composed of the two triangles, the rhombus’s area must be equal to 2√6610260=5142.085180….cmThe area of the rhombus to three decimal places is 5‎ ‎142.085 cm2.In the example that follows, we will calculate the area of a figure composed of two triangles using Heron’s formula. One of the two triangles is a right triangle, and we will need to use the Pythagorean theorem to determine one of its leg lengths.Example 4: Finding the Area of a Quadrilateral Using Heron’s FormulaFind the area of the figure below using Heron’s formula, giving the answer to three decimal places.Answer We know that Heron’s formula is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐), where 𝐴 is the area of a triangle that has sides with lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 and a semiperimeter of 𝑠. We also know that the semiperimeter can be calculated with the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2.In order to use Heron’s formula to calculate the area of the figure, we must decompose it into a pair of triangles.One of the triangles into which the figure can be decomposed has side lengths of 16 cm, 20 cm, and 23 cm. Let’s begin by finding the area of this triangle using Heron’s formula. Substituting the triangle’s three side lengths into the semiperimeter formula gives us 𝑠=16+20+232=592=29.5.cmNext, substituting the triangle’s three side lengths and its semiperimeter into Heron’s formula gives us 𝐴=√29.5(29.5−16)(29.5−20)(29.5−23)=√29.5(13.5)(9.5)(6.5)=√24591.9375=156.818166….cmLooking at the other triangle, we can see that it is a right triangle with a leg that is 16 cm long and a hypotenuse that is 20 cm long. However, we are not given the length of the other leg of the triangle.In order to find the length, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if a right triangle has legs of lengths 𝑎 and 𝑏 and a hypotenuse of length 𝑐, then 𝑎+𝑏=𝑐.We can substitute 𝑎=16 and 𝑐=20, and then solve for 𝑏 to determine the length as follows: 16+𝑏=20,256+𝑏=400,𝑏=144,𝑏=12.cmNote that we only need to consider the positive root of 144, since a length cannot be negative. Thus, the lengths of the three sides of the second triangle are 12,16,20.cmcmandcmNow that we know all three side lengths, let’s find the triangle’s area. First, we can substitute the side lengths into the semiperimeter formula to get 𝑠=12+16+202=482=24.cmNext, we can substitute the side lengths and the semiperimeter into Heron’s formula to get 𝐴=√24(24−12)(24−16)(24−20)=√24(12)(8)(4)=√9216=96.cmNote that we could have also used the formula 𝐴=12𝑏ℎ to find the triangle’s area, since it is a right triangle with a base of 12 cm and a height of 16 cm. This formula also gives us an area of 𝐴=12(12)(16)=96.cmCombining the areas of both triangles gives us a total area of 156.818166…+96=252.818166…cm.The area of the figure to three decimal places is 252.818 cm2.In the final example, we use Heron’s formula to help us find the radius of a circle inscribed in a triangle.Example 5: Using Heron’s Formula to Find the Radius of a Circle That is Inside a TriangleThe lengths of a triangle are 12 cm, 5 cm, and 11 cm. Find the radius of the interior circle touching the sides using the formula 𝑟=△𝐴𝐵𝐶𝑃Area, where 𝑃 is half of the triangle’s perimeter.Answer According to the formula 𝑟=△𝐴𝐵𝐶𝑃,Area in order to calculate the radius of the interior circle touching the sides of the triangle described in the problem, we need to know both the triangle’s area and half its perimeter.Since we are given the side lengths of the triangle, we can use Heron’s formula to calculate its area. Recall that Heron’s formula states that the area, 𝐴, of a triangle with side lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 and a semiperimeter of 𝑠 is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐).The semiperimeter can be found using the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2.Let’s begin by finding the triangle’s semiperimeter. Note that this will also be the value of 𝑃 in 𝑟=△𝐴𝐵𝐶𝑃,Area because it is half the triangle’s perimeter. Using the triangle’s side lengths of 12 cm, 5 cm, and 11 cm, its semiperimeter is 𝑠=12+5+112=282=14.cmNow, we can substitute the triangle’s side lengths into Heron’s formula for 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, and its semiperimeter for 𝑠, giving 𝐴=√14(14−12)(14−5)(14−11)=√14(2)(9)(3)=√756=6√21.cmSince we have now established that half the perimeter of the triangle described in the problem is 14 cm and that its area is 6√21 cm2, we can use the formula 𝑟=△𝐴𝐵𝐶𝑃Area to calculate the radius of the interior circle touching the triangle’s sides. Substituting into the formula gives us 𝑟=6√2114=37√21.cmThe radius of the circle is 37√21 cm.Now let’s finish by recapping some key points.Key PointsHeron’s formula states that the area, 𝐴, of a triangle with side lengths of 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 is 𝐴=√𝑠(𝑠−𝑎)(𝑠−𝑏)(𝑠−𝑐), where 𝑠 is the semiperimeter of the triangle, or half its perimeter.A triangle’s semiperimeter is given by the formula 𝑠=𝑎+𝑏+𝑐2, where 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 are its side lengths.The radius of the interior circle touching the sides of a triangle can be calculated using the formula 𝑟=△𝐴𝐵𝐶𝑃,Area where 𝑃 is half of the triangle’s perimeter.

Not to mention, mathematicians are heroes as well! As a matter of fact, this formula allows you to save the day in geometric terms. With this in mind, let us discuss the Heron’s formula or we can say the triangle’s area formula and study its applications. Table of content Suggested Videos Heron's Formula Heron's Formula Triangles A triangle is a 3 sided enclosed figure in geometry. Also, the sum of all the angles of a triangle is 180°. Furthermore, depending upon the length of the sides of triangles, they are classified into 3 types. Namely, Equilateral Triangle: In this type, all the sides of the triangle are equal in length. Furthermore, all angles measure 60°. In the figure below, we see an equilateral triangle. Isosceles Triangle: When any 2 sides of a triangle are same in length then such a triangle is called an isosceles triangle. In the figure below, we see a triangle whose 2 sides are similar in length to one another. Also, the angles opposite to these identical sides also measure the same. Scalene Triangle: A triangle in which no side is equivalent in length to the other is called a scalene triangle. Also, no two angles of the triangle measure the same. What is the Heron’s Formula about? In , Heron’s formula is used to determine the area of a triangle. If we know the length of 3 sides, then we can calculate the area of any type of using this formula. Moreover, this area formula makes the calculation of the very easy because it eliminates the use of and the need to calculate the height of the triangle. However, the only drawback to this formula is that it demands the length of all 3 sides. Heron’s Formula Any triangle has 3 sides. We represent the length of the 3 sides as ‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’ units respectively. Therefore the sum of lengths of all the 3 sides (perimeter) is P = a + b+ c. Hence, the semi perimeter of the triangle is s = P/2 = (a+b+c)/2 By Heron’s formula, the area of the triangle is √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] The above area of triangle formula is applicable for all triangles irrespective of the side lengths. Solved Examples on Heron’s Formula Question 1: Find the area of a triangle having the length of sides as 3, 4 and 5 units respectively : Given that a=3, b=4, c=5 P= (a+b+c)= (3+4+5)= 12 S= P/2 = 12/2=6 Area= √s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c) =√6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5) =√6x3x2x1 =√36 =6 Area of the triangle is 6 units. Question 2. The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is 41 cm and the area of the triangle is 180 sq. cm, then the difference between the lengths of the legs of the triangles must be 22 cm 25 cm 31 cm 27 cm Answer: C. The given is 180 cm² Implies, (1/2)ab = 180 ab = 2 × 180 = 360 So now by applying , a² + b² = 41 ² a² + b² = 1681 So, a² + b² – 2ab = 1681 – 2*360 (a-b)² = 961 a-b = √961 = 31 cm The difference between the lengths of the legs of the triangle must be 31 cm. Question 3: What is the Heron’s Formula about? Answer: In geometry, we use Heron’s formula to find the area of a triangle. If the length of 3 sides is known, then we can find the area of a triangle through this formula. This area formula makes calculating the area of a triangle quite simple because it eliminates the use of angles and you need not calculate the height as well. However, the only shortcoming of this formula is that it requires the length of all 3 sides. Question 4: What is an Isosceles Triangle? Answer: Isosceles triangle is one in which any 2 sides are equal in length. Furthermore, the angles opposite to these uniform lengths also measure the same.

Table of Content Heron’s formula (also known as Hero’s formula) gives the area of a triangle when the lengths of all three sides are known in geometry. It is named after Hero of Alexandria. Unlike previous triangle area formulas, no angles or other distances in the triangle must be calculated first.It’s used to calculate the area of various triangles, including equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles, as well as quadrilaterals. When the sides of a triangle are known, we may apply Heron’s formula to calculate the area. The area of the triangle is calculated using Heron’s formula with the triangle’s semi-perimeter and side lengths. Table of content Definition:- When the lengths of all of a triangle’s sides are known, Heron’s formula is used to find the area of the triangle, as well as the area of quadrilaterals. Hero’s formula is another name for it. This formula for calculating the area of a triangle is independent of the triangle’s angles. It is totally determined by the lengths of all triangle sides. It bears the letter “s,” which stands for semi-perimeter, which is obtained by halves a triangle’s perimeter. Similarly, the principle of determining the area is extended to determine the area of quadrilaterals. History of Heron’s Formula:- Heron of Alexandria penned Heron’s formula about 60 CE. He was a Greek engineer and mathematician who calculated the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides and went on to calculate the areas of quadrilaterals using the same method. This formula was used to prove trigonometric laws such as the Laws of Cosines and the Laws of Cotangents. Mathematical Statement:- According to Heron’s formula, the area of any triangle having lengths a, b, c, and ‘s’ as semi-perimeter of the triangle is determined using the below-given formula: Triangle’s Area According to Heron’s Formula:- The following are the steps to use Heron’s formula to calculate the area:Calculate the perimeter of the triangle.Halve the perimeter to find the semi-perimeter.Using Heron’s formula √{s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)}, calculate the triangle’s area.After you’ve determined the value, write the unit at the end (For example, m², cm², or in²). Area of Equilateral Triangle by Heron Formula:- All of the sides of an equilateral triangle are the same length. As a result, the lengths of all sides are equal in this example. Assume that the length of all sides is “a,” the semi-perimeter is “s,” and the equilateral triangle’s area is “A.” As a result, the triangle’s semi-perimeter is s=a+ a+ a ⁄ 2=3a ⁄ 2 .So area of the equilateral triangle is determined by; Important notes on Heron’s Formula:- When all of a triangle’s sides are known, Heron’s formula is used to calculate its area.By dividing the quadrilateral into two triangles, we can apply Heron’s formula to get the area.The triangle’s semi-perimeter and side lengths are used in the formula. Application of Heron’s Formula:- Heron’s formula can be used in a variety of situations. They are as follows:If the lengths of the different sides of a triangle are known, it can be used to calculate their area.If the lengths of all of the quadrilateral’s sides are known, it can be used to calculate its area.The area of any irregular quadrilateral can be calculated using Heron’s formula by turning the quadrilateral into triangles. Conclusion: Heron’s formula is a formula for calculating the area of a triangle in terms of the lengths of its sides that is credited to Heron of Alexandria (c. 62 CE). If the lengths of the sides are a, b, and c in symbols, then:A = √{(s – a)(s – b)(s – c)} , where s is half the perimeter, or (a + b + c)/2.

Ans: When the lengths of all triangles are known, Heron’s formula is used to calculate the area of the triangle. It can be used to calculate the areas of various triangles, including equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles. The semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c)/2, and area of triangle A are given as √{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}, respectively, for a triangle with three sides, a, b, and c, respectively. Ans Heron’s formula is based solely on a triangle’s semi-perimeter and the lengths of its three sides. Using the lengths of the triangle’s three sides, we first calculate the value of the semi-perimeter. We can calculate the area of the shape after we have the value of the semi-perimeter. Ans: Heron of Alexandria (also known as Hero of Alexandria) was a Greek Engineer and Mathematician who discovered Heron’s Formula. He calculated the area of a triangle using only the lengths of its sides, allowing it to be applied to any type of triangle, including equilateral, isosceles, and scalene triangles. He extended this formula to compute the areas of quadrilaterals and proved trigonometric rules such as the Laws of Cosines and the Laws of Cotangents. Ans: Using the Pythagoras theorem, the area of a triangle formula, and algebraic identities, we may deduce Heron’s formula. From the top vertex to the base of the triangle, we build an attitude that divides the triangle into two triangles. We derive Heron’s formula by applying the Pythagoras theorem to both triangles and substituting the numbers obtained. Ans: By drawing a perpendicular from one of the top vertices to the base, we may calculate the area of the trapezium. After that, we have one parallelogram and a triangle. The area of the trapezium can be calculated by summing the areas of a parallelogram and a triangle in this situation. The area of the parallelogram may now be calculated using the formula for the area of a parallelogram or by drawing a diagonal to divide the parallelogram into two sections. We get three triangles in this situation. As a result, we use Heron’s method to compute the area of all three triangles. In either case, area values are calculated separately and then summed to determine the trapezium’s area.

The formula is a specialization of Brahmagupta's formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. For, after all, every triangle is a cyclic quadrilateral with two coalesced vertices. I find the rather amusing because it exploits the dissection of a triangle induced by the presence of the incircle. If you are reading this, your browser is not set to run Java applets. Try IE11 or Safari and declare the site https:///www.cut-the-knot.org as trusted in the Java setup. In ΔABC, the lengths of the segments from vertices to the points of tangency of the incircle are found to be x = s - a, y = s - b, z = s - c, so that Heron's formula can be also written as S² = sxyz. Let r be the inradius of ΔABC. The rearrangement of the six triangles of the dissection as done at the bottom of the applet, shows immediately that S = rs. Let I be the incenter and denote w = AI. From the diagram in the right portion of the applet, xyz = r²(x + y + z) = r²s. It then follows that sxyz = r²s² = S², which completes the proof. Note: let the angles of the triangle be 2α, 2β, 2γ so that α + β + γ = 90°. The identity xyz = r²(x + y + z) is equivalent to the following trigonometric formula: cotα + cotβ + cotγ = cotα cotβ cotγ, where ""cot"" denotes the standard cotangent function. Note: Heron's formula is an immediate consequence of that of Brahmagupta which is stated for cyclic quadrilaterals. Letting one of the sides vanish leads to Heron's formula. Curiously, Brahmagupta's formula can be derived from Heron's. References R. Vakil, , Brendan Kelly Publishing, 2008 (Expanded Edition), pp. 178-179 Related materialRead more...

It does not require the to compute the area; instead, it requires the lengths of the three sides which are easier to find. In the formula, the sides of the triangle are labeled as aaa, bbb, and ccc. It is standard in geometry to denote sides in lower case letters as you can see here. In addition, we will need the semi-perimeter of the triangle which is simply the sum of the three sides divided by 222. The semi-perimeter is a required value in the formula. Example 1: Find the area of the triangle below using Heron’s Formula. Just a few housekeeping notes. We label the vertices (corners) of the triangles with uppercase letters. In this case, we use A, B, and C. The side opposite vertex A (or angle A) is side aaa. The side opposite vertex B is side bbb. And finally, the side opposite vertex C is side ccc. Note that for the side lengths, we denote them with lower case letters. With that said, we are able to map the values of the sides of the triangle. Since, a=5a=5a=5 feet b=13b=13b=13 feet c=12c=12c=12 feet The semi-perimeter of the triangle is We have all the necessary information to calculate the area of the triangle using Heron’s formula. Therefore, the area of triangle △\triangle△ ABC is 303030 square feet. Example 2: Find the area of the triangle below using Heron’s Formula. In our previous lesson, we learned how to find the . We may not need to use Heron’s formula because it appears that side BC‾\overline{BC}BC forms a right angle with side CA‾\overline{CA}CA which implies that BC‾\overline{BC}BC is the height and CA‾\overline{CA}CA is the base of triangle △ABC\triangle{ABC}△ABC. Let’s calculate the area of the triangle using the standard formula. Since, base = 888 height = 666 Therefore, the area of △ABC\triangle{ABC}△ABC is Using the standard formula, we calculated the area of the triangle as 242424 square inches. What we want now is to show that we can get the same area using Heron’s Formula. From the triangle, a=6a=6a=6 b=8b=8b=8 c=10c=10c=10 Calculating our semi-perimeter, we get Let’s put it all together to solve for the area of the triangle using Heron’s formula. Therefore, the area of the triangle is 242424 square inches. This answer is an exact match to the solution using the standard formula (1/2 base times height). Great!

How can we use it in our daily life? These are the questions that arise when we talk about Chapter 12 of the class 9 maths. Named upon one of the of all time, Heron’s Formula opens a door to a new and interesting concept of maths. As Heron’s Formula is a vital topic as per the , it is important to ace it if you want to qualify the class 9th with flying colours. So, let’s get started and go through this informational blog about this topic. This Blog Includes: What is Heron’s formula? Heron, a Greek mathematician, has worked out this formula. He received praises for his proficiency in mathematics and was called ‘hero’ of mathematics. Because of his excellence, the formula is also called the ‘Heron’s formula.’ He wrote various procedures and compiled all of them in three volumes. Each volume has the formulas for various mathematical fields. Book I encompasses the Heron formulae, which has the area equations for different types of shapes. YouTube: Don’t Memorise Where Can We Use the Heron Formula? With the heron formulae, you can calculate the area of a triangle, whatever may be its side lengths. In the case of equilateral and isosceles, finding the height of the triangle will lead you to the calculation of its area. To evaluate the area of the equilateral triangle, we first derive the height h using the Pythagoras theorem. Then, we compute the area of the triangle using the following formula: Area of a triangle = ½ x b x h But, what will we do if we cannot find the height of the triangle? If we have a scalene body, it’s not easy to find its apex. A triangle with irregular side lengths is called a scalene triangle.That’s the point where Heron formulae come into play. For example, if a triangle has the measurements 10 m, 15 m, and 20 m, then you can say it as a scalene triangle. Also Read: YouTube: Let’s Tute Heron’s Formula In the Heron formula, we use a semi-perimeter to obtain the area. S stands for semi-perimeter, which is nothing but half of the perimeter (P/2). As we all know, the perimeter is the boundary or border of your respective area’s shape. It is the total of all the surface lengths. For a scalene triangle, you can calculate the perimeter and area using the formulae: Perimeter of an Area, P = (a + b + c)/ 2Area of the triangle, A = S (S-A) (S-B) (S-C) m2 Where,S = semi perimeter of the triangle = Perimeter/2A, B, C = Side lengths of the trianglePerimeter P = Sum of three side lengths= AB + BC + CA Example 1:A boy is crossing a triangular playground having a scalene body with the side lengths 12 m, 5 m, and 6 m. He wishes to find the area of the ground. Solution:Here, we will use the Heron formula to calculate the playground’s area.Area of the triangle A = S (S-A) (S-B) (S-C)Where,So, semi-perimeter will be,S = (A + B + C)/2 = (10 +5 + 6)/2 = 11.5 mNow, apply the values in the Heron’s formula,S – A = 11.5 – 10 = 1.5 S – B = 11.5 – 5 = 6.5 S – C = 11.5 – 6 = 5.5A = S (S -A) (S – B) (S – C) m2 = 11.5 (1.5) (6.5) (5.5) m2 = 616.69Area of the triangle, A = 24 m2 This is how we can derive the area of an irregular triangle using the Heron’s formula. Here are some to reduce your overall calculation time! [optin-monster-shortcode id=”xf2mlnjiouddzrshykdb”] Example 2Now, let’s see another example confining the Heron’s formula. Rohit has decided to calculate the cost of the tiles for his bedroom, having a triangular form. The side lengths of the rooms are as follows: 5 m, 4 m, and 7 m whereas the cost of a single 2 x 2 tile is Rs. 10. Find the total area and its cost. Solution:The problem encloses the same set of steps that we had used in the previous example.First, find the perimeter P = 5m + 4m + 7m = 16mNow, find the semi-perimeter S = P / 2= 16 /2, S= 8 metresSubstituting the values in the Heron’s formulaA = S (S -A) (S – B) (S – C) m2So, Area of the triangle = 8 (8 -5) (8 – 4) (8 – 7) m2= 8 (3) (4) (1) m2= 9216A= 96 m2 Area of a single tile = 2 x 2 m2Number of tiles required for the room = Area of the triangleArea of the single tile= 96 m2 / 4 m2 = 24 nosHaving the number of tiles, now we can calculate the cost of tiles for the bedroom So, Cost = 24 x 10=Rs. 240 Books for Practising Heron’s Formula Here are some !

Heron’s Formula How will you find the area of a triangle, if the height is not known but the lengths of the three sides are known? For this, Heron has given a formula to find the area of a triangle. If a, b and c are the sides of a triangle, then the area of a triangle = √[ s ( s − a )(s − b)(s − c)] sq.units. where s = [ a + b + c ] / 2, ‘s’ is the semi-perimeter (that is half of the perimeter) of the triangle. Note If we assume that the sides are of equal length that is a = b = c, then Heron’s formula will be √3/4 a2 sq.units, which is the area of an equilateral triangle. Example 7.1 The lengths of sides of a triangular field are 28 m, 15 m and 41 m. Calculate the area of the field. Find the cost of levelling the field at the rate of ₹ 20 per m2. Solution Let a = 28 m, b = 15 m and c = 41m Then, s = (a + b + c) / 2 = (28 +15+ 41) / 2 = 84/2 = 42 m Area of triangular field = √ [ s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) ] = √ [ 42(42 − 28)(42 −15)(42 − 41)] = √ [42 ×14 × 27 ×1] = √ [ 2×3×7×7×2×3×3×3×1] = 2×3×7×3 = 126 m2 Given the cost of levelling is ₹ 20 per m2. The total cost of levelling the field = 20 ×126 = ₹ 2520. Example 7.2 Three different triangular plots are available for sale in a locality. Each plot has a perimeter of 120 m. The side lengths are also given: Help the buyer to decide which among these will be more spacious. Solution For clarity, let us draw a rough figure indicating the measurements: (i) The semi-perimeter of Note that all the semi-perimeters are equal. (ii) Area of triangle using Heron’s formula: In Fig.7.4, Area of triangle = √ [60(60 − 30)(60 − 40)(60 − 50)] = √ [60×30×20×10] = √ [30×2×30×2×10×10] = 600 m2 In Fig.7.5, Area of triangle = √ [60(60 − 35)(60 − 40)(60 − 45)] = √ [60×25×20×15] = √ [20×3×5×5×20×3×5] = 300 √5 ( Since √5 = 2.236 ) = 670.8 m2 In Fig.7.6, Area of triangle = √ [60(60 − 40)(60 − 40)(60 − 40)] = √ [60×20×20×20] = √ [3×20×20×20×20] = 400 √3 ( Since √3 = 1.732 ) = 692.8 m2 We find that though the perimeters are same, the areas of the three triangular plots are different. The area of the triangle in Fig 7.6 is the greatest among these; the buyer can be suggested to choose this since it is more spacious. Note If the perimeter of different types of triangles have the same value, among all the types of triangles, the equilateral triangle possess the greatest area. We will learn more about maximum areas in higher classes.

See for the newly-created policy on strategy games. We're looking forward to your contributions. Trigonometry/Heron's Formula From Wikibooks, open books for an open world < Heron's formula states that the area A of a triangle whose sides have lengths a, b, and c is A = s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) {\displaystyle A={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}} where s {\displaystyle \displaystyle s} is the semiperimeter of the triangle: s = a + b + c 2 {\displaystyle s={\frac {a+b+c}{2}}} There is a proof . Exercise Let us try this for the 3-4-5 triangle, which we know is a right triangle. We know its area. It's half that of the rectangle with sides 3x4. So the area A {\displaystyle A} is 3 × 4 2 = 6 {\displaystyle {\frac {3\times 4}{2}}=6} . Let's see if Heron's formula works too. s = 3 + 4 + 5 2 = 6 {\displaystyle s={\frac {3+4+5}{2}}=6} And using Heron's formula: A = s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) = 6 ( 6 − 3 ) ( 6 − 4 ) ( 6 − 5 ) = 6 ⋅ 3 ⋅ 2 ⋅ 1 = 36 = 6 {\displaystyle A={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}={\sqrt {6(6-3)(6-4)(6-5)}}={\sqrt {6\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}}={\sqrt {36}}=6} It worked. Heron of Alexandria The formula is believed to be due to Hero (or Heron) of Alexandria (10 – 70 AD), a Greek mathematician. Worked Example Now over to you. We have an equilateral triangle with each side of length 1. The base of the triangle is 1, the height can be worked out by Pythagoras. It's 1 2 − 1 2 2 = 3 2 {\displaystyle {\sqrt {1^{2}-{\frac {1}{2^{2}}}}}={\frac {\sqrt {3}}{2}}} so the area A {\displaystyle A} of our equilateral triangle is 3 4 {\displaystyle {\frac {\sqrt {3}}{4}}} . Work out what the semi perimeter S is for this triangle, and put the values for S and the lengths of the sides into Heron's formula and compute the area, A. s = {\displaystyle s=} And using Heron's formula: A = s ( s − a ) ( s − b ) ( s − c ) = {\displaystyle A={\sqrt {s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}=} Did the answer work out correctly?

It is called “Heron’s Formula” after Hero of Alexandria who was a Greek Engineer and Mathematician. According to Heron’s Formula, area of a triangle whose sides are a, b, and c is given as: Example: Find the area of a triangle whose sides are: a = 5, b = 6, c = 7 s = (5 + 6 + 7)/2 = 18/2 = 9 A = sqrt[9(9 – 5)(9 – 6)(9 – 7)] = sqrt[9(4)(3)(2)] = sqrt(216)≈ 14.7 SchoolTutoring Academy is the premier educational services company for K-12 and college students.
