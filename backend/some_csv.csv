STEM comprises the following major areas of study: Beaker Natural, physical, and life sciences (sometimes including medicine) Rss Computer, electronics, and other technology-related disciplines Cog All types of engineering Calculator Mathematics, or any field involving a heavy application of mathematical principles Many debate whether certain fields count as STEM. Some STEM definitions include the , such as , economics, and anthropology. Most sources, however, consider these separate categories. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains a , which includes the four basic subjects above, along with architecture, psychology, digital communication, and some pharmaceutical and social sciences. Notably, fields like , , and are excluded from this list. to STEM, only officially recognized by the U.S. government in 2019. Many also and should be considered STEM. ACT Inc. includes many health and medical fields in its , giving doctors, nurses, and dentists the designation of STEM professionals. What Is a STEM Major? A STEM major is any major in a recognized STEM field. Note that colleges may have different definitions of what areas of study constitute a STEM major. Most undergraduate STEM programs culminate in a , though others may lead to a bachelor of applied science, a bachelor of engineering, or a bachelor of architecture. STEM students commonly take many of the same courses in fields like biology, chemistry, calculus, statistics, and engineering, regardless of their major. STEM degrees tend to be some of the in terms of the amount of time students typically spend completing assignments and preparing for class each week.

STEM integrates multiple disciplines and trains students to use cross-disciplinary knowledge to solve problems. Additionally, STEM students take a rigorous and varied course load and develop a strong work ethic. STEM programs promote a learn-by-doing approach. Students participate in real-world projects with real-world consequences. For example, students often participate in university research programs. This approach allows students to learn while also taking an active role in the development of . Universities hosting STEM programs benefit as well. They get credit for and revenue from new technologies the programs generate. For example, the University of Minnesota received $66 million from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to for antiviral drug development in 2022. The University was awarded this grant as a result of its innovative efforts in the initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Having workers with STEM skills boosts the U.S. economy and helps the country compete globally. To maintain an adequate STEM workforce, the U.S government offers programs to help immigrants with skills in STEM subjects obtain work visas. Careers in STEM fields require a variety of skills, depending on the job, though most require critical thinking and problem solving capabilities. Reasons to consider majoring in a STEM field There are many reasons to consider a STEM major. The following are some of them: Challenging field of study. If students want an engaging field of study that challenges them, STEM is the way to go. Higher paying careers. STEM offers students a chance at higher paying jobs. In 2021, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that STEM occupations had compared to the national average for all occupations. Make a difference.

It underpins the foundational stage of many sectors, ranging from healthcare to aviation and much more and is often integral to an organisation and thus is becoming an ever-more important field for students.STEM classrooms typically focus on project-based learning. Projects and activities conducted usually involve modern technology to accentuate the practical applications of science in the near future. Students get to apply the various domains of STEM in a context that helps them realize a connection between the classroom and the world around them.This article aims at simplifying matters by presenting more information about what STEM education is, and how it can turn the wheels of your or your child’s future. Students are offered real-time applications and learning experiences that will help in moulding them for a better future that is scientifically driven.What is the Importance of STEM Education?STEM Education has developed to be more significant for the world as it poses a range of advantages in a myriad of fields. As most of the sectors are dependent on the STEM fields, it indirectly plays a significant role in the flourishing of the economy. In the coming years, the STEM sector is expected to be one of the largest employers in the world. We see new and innovative technologies being developed every day, and this number is only expected to increase in the coming years.With significant advances in each of the STEM domains, new career prospects are popping up at a very fast pace. In recent years, there has been a shortage of well-trained STEM workforce in several parts of the world. While the demand for trained students is increasing by the day, the number of students interested in pursuing a career in STEM is going down at an alarming pace.For example, in the United Kingdom alone, there is the requirement to graduate at least 120,000 STEM majors every year just to meet the demand. Although STEM in the UK have traditionally been well subscribed, the number of students focusing on these topics has gone down recently. This has called for major revamps in the education system, in order to inspire students to opt for and excel in STEM subjects.STEM education can be looked upon in two different aspects; from the periphery of students in school and the teaching methodology incorporated therein and two; from the perspective of the general public, comprising of parents, and teachers who can indirectly assist students in opting for the programme.Students and educators must work together so that subjects are presented and understood in a manner that can be practised in real-life.A better understanding of the not only helps us in getting a clear picture of what it includes but also presents us with a platform to become more aware of STEM as a learning medium.What are the Benefits of STEM Education?So, let’s go ahead in gaining a better insight and sneak into what STEM Education is, in addition to elaborating on its significance in the future of our students.An abundance of job opportunitiesEducation is a vital component of building a great career. When it comes to STEM, there are countless jobs that offer enriching opportunities and good pay. In 2018, in comparison to other jobs in the country, that pay an average salary of £12-17 per hour, the average pay for a STEM job is approximately £20-30. Moreover, with a scarcity of talent in the field of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, more and more companies are opting to pay extremes to candidates who fit the category well. Here is where London International Youth Science Forum makes our presence felt. These programmes play an important role in nurturing scientific minds and building them for the future. Our annual gatherings include speeches from those who have made a mark in their field. The London International Youth Science Forum with its scientific visits and also an additional CERN tour covers knowledge on a broad range of topics and subjects. The curriculum is tailored to suit a student’s interest in the field. Some of the raging topics such as Biology, Artificial Intelligence, Engineering, Robotics, Medicine, Nano Technology, Astrophysics, math, etc. All these are dealt with in depth by world-class researchers.This brings us to the next question, why are there so many openings under STEM. All the jobs that fall under the umbrella of STEM are continuously expanding over the years. There is a gradual rise in the demand for jobs. In addition to newer opportunities in the form of AI and Machine Learning are also gaining significant limelight lately. In the present time in 2020, STEM fields are much bigger and play a prominent role.Innovation is the breeding fuelWhen it comes to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics, innovation is its other name. As the field is ever dynamic, it presents students the opportunity to innovate and challenge their knowledge. This is one of the primary reasons for the , thereby leading to a surge in the demand. Besides, herein children are presented with the opportunity to work in jobs which are different and hardly dreamt of.In all senses, STEM jobs make for an interesting future. Whether the factors are money or subject matter, STEM provides a panoramic view of the future. This provides a great platform for students, a future that is filled with innovation, futuristic learning, and a lot of exploration of skills.Introducing STEM at an early ageChildren are often introduced to reading and sports at a young age. The pretext of this is to instil in them curiosity and stimulate their interest. This with time gets seeped into their system and they form an interest in exploring it further.The same technique fits well for adults too. When we look back on our educational interests it holds a deeper connection to areas, in which we excelled or skilled ourselves during our childhood. Thus, during their early years of learning can eventually go on to help generate further curiosity and even ability. It will also assist in sharpening their scientific disciplines too.Students are sculpted to grab the nuances of the field and thereby pique their interest in building a career in STEM fields. Our Youth Science Camps are designed to introduce today’s youth to the endless opportunities presented in STEM Education. We also conduct regular , as well as scientific visits guided by experts. Students are acquainted with the vast field of possibilities and inspiring innovation.How Does STEM Education Help Students?Students and youth have a sense of curiosity that constantly looks for activities that can challenge them. Keeping this inquisitiveness and curiosity sparked helps them to maximize their capacities. Science camps, like LIYSF, assist students to draw inferences, driving connections, and exploring deeper meaning and understanding of fields that interest them. Hands-on Learning in STEMThe educator, or the teacher, in student learning. For a student to gain and maintain interest in a STEM subject, it is necessary for the teacher to facilitate such a learning environment where the student understands the concepts and is able to apply them to real-life applications.The teacher’s role is to:Cover all the necessary material in the classroom.Act as a knowledge medium between the student and the concepts being taught.Act as an informed guide whenever the student is unsure of how to proceed with a problem or an assignment.It is, therefore, of utmost importance for educators to stay constantly up-to-date with the current trends and advancements in .One effective way to enhance the student’s interest in STEM is to organize several field trips. Since STEM is an application-based curriculum, the principles taught here are applied in many scientific fields and major industries across the world.Many organizations especially in the UK, are well-known for the science camps and STEM summer schools they organize for enthusiastic young students.These organizations work on a non-profit basis and have tie-ups with many renowned industries and state-of-the-art research facilities in and around the UK. They allow students to visit these places to gain hands-on experience with current scientific research.The students also get to interact with scientists and industry professionals working in various fields of STEM. They get to explore a number of these fields, while also interacting with other students, from all over the world, who have similar interests.This exercise helps them realize their passion and gain the confidence to cement their careers in the STEM sector.Demand for STEM JobsAs per the study conducted by the , Britain will require approximately 1,000,000 STEM majors to meet the demand of the country in 2020. Furthermore, there is a shortage of over 2,100,000 workers in the fields of mathematics, natural science, technology, and computer science disciplines. We are not oblivious to the myriad of challenges faced by the world in the present time, many of which can only be addressed by scientists. A scientific thought process poses a promising future in bringing change to the world. Whether the problem is related to nature, climate change, viral attacks, overpopulation, management of data, ageing or cybersecurity, each finds its roots in science. This makes it even more important to introduce students to a scientific and technological landscape to help find solutions. Having now considered what each phase of the learning deals with, let’s move further to the next important aspect; gaining an overview of the opportunities and the future.Projected percentage increases in STEM jobs 2010-2020 – Image Source: Careers in STEMThe UK is one of the pioneers in . There is a very sophisticated and unique curriculum to pique the student’s curiosity in STEM subjects.Looking for an opportunity for STEM learning in the UK, especially in one of their top-ranking schools or universities, would pretty much guarantee you a highly fruitful career in STEM. According to a recent report, a bulk of the are going to be in:Computing – 71%Traditional Engineering – 16%Physical sciences – 7%Life sciences – 4%Mathematics – 2%A good number of STEM careers don’t even require higher education or a college degree, although, having a bachelor’s degree or equivalent would be a major advantage for the student.A four-year degree can potentially amplify the salary of the student several times. A few facts regarding STEM jobs with a bachelor’s degree requirement:Their average starting salary for entry-level jobs is 26% higher than jobs in the non-STEM fields.There are currently over 2.5 entry-level job postings, for every job posting in a non-STEM field.These facts prove that STEM programmes, especially those studies with a four-year degree, can lead to a very successful career for most aspirants.STEM is also one of the few sectors that work hard to be an equal opportunity employer, having a strong outlook for no discrimination based on gender, colour, or ethnicity. Yet, a number of STEM fields have seen a continued lack of women and people of colour as well as people from underrepresented populations.Therefore, the need of the day is to modify the STEM curriculum to attract students from all segments. The curriculum changes should reflect as early as elementary school levels, to make a lasting impression in the students’ minds.What makes education in STEM"

It would be inaccurate to assume that STEM education is merely instruction in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Rather, the idea is taken a step further. STEM education refers to the integration of the four subjects into a cohesive, interdisciplinary and applied learning approach. This isn’t academic theory—STEM education includes the appropriate real-world application and teaching methods. As a result, students in any subject can benefit from STEM education. That’s exactly why some educators and organizations refer to it as STEAM, which adds in arts or other creative subjects. They recognize just how powerful the philosophy behind STEM education can be for students. Why Is STEM Education Important? There are several layers to explore in discovering why STEM education is so important. Background In 2018, the White House released the “Charting a Course for Success” that illustrated how far the United States was behind other countries in STEM education. It found that only 20% of high school grads were ready for the rigors of STEM majors. And how over the previous 15 years, the U.S. had produced only 10% of the world’s science and engineering grads. Since the founding of the Nation, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have been a source of inspirational discoveries and transformative technological advances, helping the United States develop the world's most competitive economy and preserving peace through strength. The pace of innovation is accelerating globally, and with it the competition for scientific and technical talent. Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and securit —depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem. - Charting a Course for Success That was one of the most news-worthy developments in recent years. It set the stage for many arguments behind STEM in the context of the global economy and supporting it through education. Job Outlook and Salary One of the most direct and powerful arguments for the importance of STEM education is how relevant STEM is in the workforce. In 2018, the Pew Research Center found that STEM employment had grown since 1990 (computer jobs increased 338%). What about now? All occupations are projected to increase 7.7% by 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Non-STEM occupations will increase 7.5% while STEM occupations will increase . The findings are even more pronounced in terms of salary. The median annual wage for all occupations is 40,020 and those in STEM occupations earn $89,780. Even areas like entrepreneurship see the same types of results. A from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) found that tech-based startups pay more than double the national average wage and nearly three times the average overall startup wage. They only make up 3.8% of businesses but capture a much larger share of business research and development investment (70.1%), research and development jobs (58.7%) and wages (8.1%), among other areas. Diversity and Skills An important detail in the passage from “Charting a Course for Success” comes toward the end of the final sentence: “Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and security—depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem.” Being inclusive is incredibly important once you understand how STEM occupations are such high-demand, high-paying positions. Unfortunately, however, diversity is a significant issue here. The Pew Research Center noted how women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented across many other STEM fields, especially in computer jobs and engineering. Black and Hispanic workers are also underrepresented in the STEM workforce. In the International Journal of STEM Education, authors noted how women are significantly underrepresented in STEM occupations. They make up of those working in STEM occupations and for women of color, representation is much lower — Hispanic, Asian and Black women receive less than 5% of STEM bachelor’s degrees in the U.S. Authors also pointed out how people of color overall are underrepresented in U.S.-based STEM leadership positions across industry, academia and the federal workforce. These issues are troubling when you consider how it undermines students’ opportunities to pursue high-demand, high-paying roles. Yet, it’s more than that. STEM education is about a teaching philosophy that naturally integrates critical thinking and language skills in a way that enriches any subject. Perhaps you’ve experienced or can imagine an education that integrates problem solving and engineering practices into any subject, where technology is seamlessly integrated throughout. Any subject—art, language, social studies, health—can benefit. So when students don’t receive an effective STEM education, they’re not only receiving less instruction in STEM"
0,britannica,What is STEM Education and Why is it Important?,https://www.britannica.com/topic/STEM-education,"STEM in the United States In the early 2000s in the , the disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics became increasingly integrated following the publication of several key reports. In particular, Rising Above the Gathering Storm (2005), a report of the U.S. National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine, emphasized the links between prosperity, knowledge-intensive jobs dependent on science and technology, and continued to address societal problems. U.S. students were not achieving in the STEM disciplines at the same rate as students in other countries. The report predicted dire consequences if the country could not compete in the global economy as the result of a poorly prepared workforce. Thus, attention was focused on science, mathematics, and technology research; on economic policy; and on education. Those areas were seen as being crucial to maintaining U.S. prosperity. Findings of international studies such as TIMSS (Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study), a periodic international comparison of mathematics and science knowledge of fourth and eighth graders, and PISA (Programme for International Student Assessment), a triennial of knowledge and skills of 15-year-olds, reinforced concerns in the United States. PISA 2006 results indicated that the United States had a comparatively large proportion of underperforming students and that the country ranked 21st (in a panel of 30 countries) on of scientific and knowledge. The international comparisons fueled discussion of U.S. education and workforce needs. A bipartisan congressional STEM Education Caucus was formed, noting: Our knowledge-based economy is driven by constant innovation. The foundation of innovation lies in a , motivated and well-educated workforce equipped with STEM skills. While the goal in the is a prepared STEM , the challenge is in determining the most-strategic expenditure of funds that will result in the greatest impact on the preparation of students to have success in STEM"
0,nsta,What is STEM Education and Why is it Important?,https://www.nsta.org/nstas-official-positions/stem-education-teaching-and-learning,"STEM education is an experiential learning pedagogy in which the application of knowledge and skills are integrated through in-context projects or problems focused on learning outcomes tied to the development of important college and career readiness proficiencies. The research (Renninger 2000; Tai et al 2006) identifies that personal interest, experience, and enthusiasm are critical to supporting children’s science learning and can be a catalyst for long-term, sustained interest into adulthood. As described in A Framework for K–12 Science Education, many important decisions in the 21st century will require the abilities of the citizenry to frame scientific questions pertinent to their interests; evaluate complex social, civic, economic, political, and personal issues; seek out relevant data and scientific argument; and communicate their understandings and arguments to others. The importance of STEM education to our nation’s future cannot be overstated. As explained in the National Science Foundation (NSF) report A National Action Plan for Addressing the Critical Needs for U.S. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education System, “In the 21st century, scientific and technological innovations have become increasingly important as we face the benefits and challenges of both globalization and a knowledge-based economy. To succeed in this new information-based and highly technological society, students need to develop their capabilities in STEM to levels much beyond what was considered acceptable in the past.” (NSF 2007) Over the past 25 years, STEM education has been evolving from a convenient clustering of four overlapping disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) toward a more cohesive knowledge base and skill set critical for the 21st century. It now encompasses areas of computer science, the “designed world,” and robotics, as each of these areas reflect the integration of the original four domains of study in which the goals are to resolve problems and create innovative solutions to proposed challenges. These broader categories reveal the opportunities in the current and future workforce. According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, employment in STEM occupations grew much faster than employment in non-STEM occupations over the last decade (24.4% versus 4.0%, respectively), and STEM occupations are projected to grow by 8.9% from 2014 to 2024, compared to 6.4% growth for non-STEM occupations (Department of Commerce 2017). Recent Pew Research Center (Graf et al 2018) data shows that STEM workers earn approximately 25% more than similarly educated non-STEM workers, regardless of the education level attained. Overall, blacks and Hispanics are underrepresented in the STEM workforce relative to their shares in the U.S. workforce as a whole. The number of women in STEM-related jobs has increased in the areas of life and physical sciences, but has actually decreased in one of the highest-paying and fastest-growing STEM clusters: computer occupations. In 1990, 32% of workers in computer occupations were women; today, women’s share has dropped to 25%. A STEM-literate populace and workforce is necessary to sustain the U.S. competitive advantage in the age of globalization: not only as researchers, doctors, and engineers, but also as a hugely technical workforce that can help secure our health and safety, revitalize our utility infrastructures, monitor our food production, and improve our manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities. We must employ all members of the labor pool, especially those who have been overlooked and underrepresented, such as women and minorities. The National Science Board in A Policy Companion Statement to Science and Engineering Indicators 2018 states, “All our people must be armed with the skills and knowledge to meet the future head-on. Among the groups that are underutilized, yet essential to our future competitiveness, are workers who use technical skills in their jobs but who do not have a four-year degree (“skilled technical workers”), and people at all education levels who have been historically underrepresented in STEM. Growing the skilled technical workforce and reducing barriers to participation in STEM will increase individual economic opportunity and support our Nation’s leadership in science and technology.” STEM Education Today Modern STEM education promotes not only skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, higher-order thinking, design, and inference, but also behavioral competencies such as perseverance, adaptability, cooperation, organization, and responsibility (NSTC 2018). STEM is not a single subject, and it should not replace other subjects. Students need to learn the same concepts and skills in science and mathematics as they did before, and how to solve problems through engineering design challenges. STEM experiences must be connected and support the goals of state science standards, as well as those established in A Framework for K–12 Science Education and articulated in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS),by providing students the opportunity to grasp and experience the relevancy of what they are learning. STEM is also not a curriculum, but rather a way of organizing and delivering instruction. It is not another “ingredient” in the lesson “soup,” but the recipe for helping learners apply their knowledge and skills, collaborate with their peers, and understand the relevance of what they are learning. This does not de-emphasize the teaching of core ideas, but rather gives students the ability to know how they can apply the content they are learning. Today STEM is identified in many different ways, including in computer science and engineering/robotics. Computer science courses focus on problem solving through coding, as in the coding opportunities presented in the Hour of Code, the global movement spurred by education leaders in computer science, or in Girls Who Code, the national nonprofit organization that aims to close the gender gap in technology by building girls’ confidence and expanding their computer experience. Robotic challenges highlight engineering challenges like the FIRST Robotics Competition, which teams students, coaches, and companies. Many corporations, such as Shell, Toyota, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin, also promote these engineering design/problem challenges, which are mainly for middle and high school students. STEM education leaders must continue to broaden and deepen the scope of STEM education and further transcend the fields of study beyond just a combination of the four disciplines to include the arts and humanities (i.e., STEAM). The ability to think creatively, to communicate ideas in writing and speech with precision and clarity, to formulate and defend arguments based on evidence, and to create visual or digital models that convey evidence clearly and succinctly require students to have a strong foundation in language and creative arts. The ability to fully comprehend global issues requires that students can acknowledge and appreciate important cultural norms, social biases, and historical accomplishments of other countries and peoples. It is the combination of all of these factors that drive our innovations and technological advancements. To achieve this, educators and other leaders representing the entire educational system should consider redefining what learning success looks like for STEM education. This includes reevaluating how the physical classroom structure could better support inclusion, peer discourse, and ongoing engineering design innovations; making a commitment to advocate for a comprehensive STEM education that begins in preschool and continues post–high school; and actively promoting diversity in STEM education for all students. Lastly, STEM experiences should provide opportunities to unify communities by engaging multiple stakeholder groups, including teachers, business leaders, parents, policy makers, and most of all, students, in working toward common goals. The engagement of the entire community should play a critical role in shaping the STEM vision, promoting its importance economically, supporting its implementation through active participation like mentoring, and creating an environment of shared values. Such community advocacy can improve opportunities for many community members and raise the standard of living for all citizens. Declarations As the leading organization for science teaching and learning, NSTA asserts that educators, administrators, parents, and all stakeholders should consider the following recommendations as they develop and refine STEM education programs. STEM education programs should be grounded in the tenets of constructivism supported by the findings of three decades of cognitive science. Integrated STEM education occurs when learning is viewed as an active, constructive process, and not a receptive one; student motivation and beliefs are integral to cognition; social interaction is fundamental to cognitive development; and knowledge, strategies, and expertise are contextualized in the learning experience. High-quality K–12 STEM education is an essential, relevant, and continual endeavor for all students. STEM education enables analytical and critical thinkers; increases science, mathematics, and technology literacy; fosters the next generation of innovators and entrepreneurs; provides opportunities for students to engage in 21st-century skills of teamwork, collaboration, problem solving, communication, and creative thinking; and offers learning experiences in which students apply what they are learning in relevant, meaningful ways. The promotion and advocacy of STEM education should focus on the following: Teachers, school administrators, school boards, and school and dis­trict leaders should identify common goals and pathways to create a shared vision and definition of STEM teaching and learning for their communities. Teachers of STEM should be provided with resources necessary to implement quality STEM education in their classrooms, including opportunities for professional growth and learning through continual and sustained training, mentoring, and support services, as they plan, develop, and execute their STEM lessons and units. Schools and districts should continually provide access to technologies, materials, tools, and resources to facilitate the application of integrated STEM teaching and learning. Schools and districts should recognize that STEM education begins as early as preschool and provide accessible educational experiences that span the preK–16 spectrum. This includes embracing new approaches to STEM teaching, creating new definitions of learning success, and considering new ideas about the physical structure of the educational environment so that it is more inclusive and conducive to exploration, discovery, and design iteration. Schools and districts should implement models of professional learning and ongoing support to sustain changes in pedagogy, including instructional methods that promote learning for adults that mirror the methods to be used with students. Schools, districts, employers, the community at large, and all interested stakeholders should seek opportunities to build a capacity for joint learning, job shadowing, and mentoring of students to support students’ transition into the workforce. Schools, districts, employers, the community at large, and all interested stakeholders should help promote, facilitate, and financially support STEM"

STEM is necessary for growing the economy and staying globally competitive. You've likely heard the term STEM, but what does it stand for? STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, and math. These four fields share an emphasis on innovation, problem-solving, and critical thinking. And together they make up a popular and fast-growing industry. Most STEM workers use computers and other technology in their day-to-day jobs. Many also use the scientific method to test hypotheses and theories. Read on to learn more about the different kinds of STEM topics you can study and why these fields are so important in today's economy. What Are STEM Fields? STEM comprises the following major areas of study: Beaker Natural, physical, and life sciences (sometimes including medicine) Rss Computer, electronics, and other technology-related disciplines Cog All types of engineering Calculator Mathematics, or any field involving a heavy application of mathematical principles Many debate whether certain fields count as STEM. Some STEM definitions include the , such as , economics, and anthropology. Most sources, however, consider these separate categories. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement maintains a , which includes the four basic subjects above, along with architecture, psychology, digital communication, and some pharmaceutical and social sciences. Notably, fields like , , and are excluded from this list. to STEM, only officially recognized by the U.S. government in 2019. Many also and should be considered STEM. ACT Inc. includes many health and medical fields in its , giving doctors, nurses, and dentists the designation of STEM professionals. What Is a STEM Major? A STEM major is any major in a recognized STEM field. Note that colleges may have different definitions of what areas of study constitute a STEM major. Most undergraduate STEM programs culminate in a , though others may lead to a bachelor of applied science, a bachelor of engineering, or a bachelor of architecture. STEM students commonly take many of the same courses in fields like biology, chemistry, calculus, statistics, and engineering, regardless of their major. STEM degrees tend to be some of the in terms of the amount of time students typically spend completing assignments and preparing for class each week.

Its goals were to: ""Ensure all students finish school with strong foundational knowledge in STEM and related skills"" ""Ensure that students are inspired to take on more challenging STEM subjects"" Events and programs meant to help develop STEM in Australian schools include the , the Maths Challenge (Australian Mathematics Trust), Go Girl Go Global and the Australian Informatics Olympiad. Canada[] Canada ranks 12th out of 16 peer countries in the percentage of its graduates who studied in STEM programs, with 21.2%, a number higher than the United States, but lower than , , and . The peer country with the greatest proportion of STEM graduates, , has over 30% of its university graduates coming from science, mathematics, computer science, and engineering programs. SHAD is an annual Canadian summer enrichment program for high-achieving students in July. The program focuses on academic learning particularly in . has taken similar measures to their American counterpart to promote STEM fields to youth. Their STEM program began in 2015. In 2011 Canadian entrepreneur and philanthropist established the , 60,000 scholarships for students beginning their university education in a STEM program at 20 institutions across Canada. Each year 40 Canadian students would be selected to receive the award, two at each institution, with the goal of attracting gifted youth into the STEM fields. The program also supplies STEM scholarships to five participating universities in . Further information: China[] Middle school chemistry on a blackboard in Beijing, China, 2011 To promote STEM in China, the Chinese government issued a guideline in 2016 on national innovation-driven development strategy, instructing that by 2020, China should become an innovative country; by 2030, it should be at the forefront of innovative countries; and by 2050, it should become a technology innovation power.[] In February 2017, the Ministry of Education in China announced they would officially add STEM education to the primary school curriculum, which is the first official government recognition of STEM education. And later, in May 2018, the launching ceremony and press conference for the 2029 Action Plan for China's STEM Education was held in Beijing, China. This plan aims to allow as many students to benefit from STEM education as possible and equip all students with scientific thinking and the ability to innovate. In response to encouraging policies by the government, schools in both public and private sectors around the country have begun to carry out STEM education programs.[] However, to effectively implement STEM curricula, full-time teachers specializing in STEM education and relevant content to be taught are needed. Currently, China lacks qualified STEM teachers, and a training system is yet to be established.[] Several Chinese cities have taken bold measures to add programming as a compulsory course for elementary and middle school students. This is the case of the city of Chongqing.[] Europe[] See also: Several European projects have promoted STEM education and careers in Europe. For instance, Scientix is a European cooperation of STEM teachers, education scientists, and policymakers. The SciChallenge project used a social media contest and the student-generated content to increase motivation of pre- university students for STEM education and careers. The project AutoSTEM used automata to introduce STEM subjects to very young children. Finland[] In Finland LUMA Center is the leading advocate for STEM-oriented education. In the native tongue luma stands for ""luonnontieteellis-matemaattinen"" (lit. adj. ""scientific-mathematical""). The short is more or less a direct translation of STEM, with engineering fields included by association. However unlike STEM, the term is also a from lu and ma. France[] The name of STEM in France is industrial engineering sciences (sciences industrielles or sciences de l'ingénieur). The STEM organization in France is the association UPSTI.[] Hong Kong[] STEM education has not been promoted among the local schools in Hong Kong until recent years. In November 2015, the Education Bureau of Hong Kong released a document titled Promotion of STEM Education, which proposes strategies and recommendations on promoting STEM education. India[] Medalists from Team India at the 2019 India is next only to China with STEM graduates per population of 1 to 52. The total fresh STEM graduates were 2.6 million in 2016. STEM graduates have been contributing to the Indian economy with well paid salaries locally and abroad since last two decades. The turnaround of Indian economy with comfortable foreign exchange reserves is mainly attributed to the skills of its STEM graduates. In India, women make up an impressive 43% of STEM graduates, the highest percentage worldwide. However, they hold only 14% of STEM-related jobs. Additionally, among the 280,000 scientists and engineers working in research and development institutes in the country, women represent a mere 14% Nigeria[] In Nigeria, the Association of Professional Women Engineers Of Nigeria (APWEN) has involved girls between the ages of 12 and 19 in science based courses in other for them to pursue science based courses in the higher institutions of learning. National Science Foundation (NSF) In Nigeria has made conscious efforts to encourage girls to innovate, invent and build it through the 'invent it, build it challenge' program sponsored by NNPC. Pakistan[] STEM subjects are taught in Pakistan as part of electives taken in the 9th and 10th grade, culminating in exams. These electives are: pure sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), mathematics (Physics, Chemistry, Maths) and computer science (Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science). STEM subjects are also offered as electives taken in the 11th and 12th grade, more commonly referred to as first and second year, culminating in exams. These electives are: FSc pre- (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), FSc pre- (Physics, Chemistry, Maths) and ICS (Physics/Statistics, Computer Science, Maths). These electives are intended to aid students in pursuing STEM-related careers in the future by preparing them for the study of these courses at university. A STEM education project has been approved by the government to establish STEM labs in public schools. The has collaborated with Google to launch Pakistan's first grassroots level Coding Skills Development Program, based on Google's CS First Program, a global initiative aimed at developing coding skills in children. The aim of the program is to develop applied coding skills using gamification techniques for children between the ages of 9 and 14. The KPITBs Early Age Programming initiative, established in the province of , has been successfully introduced in 225 Elementary and Secondary Schools. There are many private organizations working in Pakistan to introduce STEM education in schools. Philippines[] In the , STEM is a two-year program and strand that is used for Senior High School (Grade 11 and 12), as signed by the or DepEd. The STEM strand is under the Academic Track, which also include other strands like ABM, HUMSS, and GAS. The purpose of STEM strand is to educate students in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, in an interdisciplinary and applied approach, and to give students advance knowledge and application in the field. After completing the program, the students will earn a Diploma in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. In some colleges and universities, they require students applying for STEM degrees (like medicine, engineering, computer studies, etc.) to be a graduate of STEM, if not, they will need to enter a bridging program. Qatar[] In , is an outreach program to high-school students with a curriculum that focuses on STEM, run by the Center for Advanced Materials (CAM) at . Each year around 946 students, from about 40 high schools, participate in AL-Bairaq competitions. AL-Bairaq make use of project-based learning, encourages students to solve authentic problems, and inquires them to work with each other as a team to build real solutions. Research has so far shown positive results for the program. Singapore[] STEM is part of the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) that the Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) has been promoting since 2013, and currently, all secondary schools have such a programme. It is expected that by 2023, all primary schools in Singapore will have an ALP. There are no tests or exams for ALPs. The emphasis is for students to learn through experimentation – they try, fail, try, learn from it and try again. The MOE actively supports schools with ALPs to further enhance and strengthen their capabilities and programmes that nurtures innovation and creativity. The Singapore Science Centre established a STEM unit in January 2014, dedicated to igniting students' passion for STEM. To further enrich students' learning experiences, their Industrial Partnership Programme (IPP) creates opportunities for students to get early exposure to the real-world STEM industries and careers. Curriculum specialists and STEM educators from the Science Centre will work hand-in-hand with teachers to co-develop STEM lessons, provide training to teachers and co-teach such lessons to provide students with an early exposure and develop their interest in STEM. Thailand[] In 2017, Thai Education Minister Teerakiat Jareonsettasin said after the 49th Southeast Asia Ministers of Education Organisation (SEAMEO) Council Conference in Jakarta that the meeting approved the establishment of two new SEAMEO regional centres in Thailand. One would be the STEM Education Centre, while the other would be a Sufficient Economy Learning Centre. Teerakiat said that the Thai government had already allocated Bt250 million over five years for the new STEM centre. The centre will be the regional institution responsible for STEM education promotion. It will not only set up policies to improve STEM education, but it will also be the centre for information and experience sharing among the member countries and education experts. According to him, ""This is the first SEAMEO regional centre for STEM education, as the existing science education centre in Malaysia only focuses on the academic perspective. Our STEM education centre will also prioritise the implementation and adaptation of science and technology."" The Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology has initiated a STEM Education Network. Its goals are to promote activities and improve student creativity and application of knowledge, and to establish a network of organisations and personnel for the promotion of STEM education in the country. Turkey[] Turkish STEM Education Task Force (or FeTeMM—Fen Bilimleri, Teknoloji, Mühendislik ve Matematik) is a coalition of academicians and teachers who show an effort to increase the quality of education in STEM fields rather than focussing on increasing the number of STEM graduates. United States[] In the United States, the acronym began to be used in education and immigration debates in initiatives to begin to address the perceived lack of qualified candidates for high-tech jobs. It also addresses concern that the subjects are often taught in isolation, instead of as an integrated curriculum. Maintaining a citizenry that is well versed in the STEM fields is a key portion of the agenda of the United States. The acronym has been widely used in the immigration debate regarding access to United States for who are skilled in these fields. It has also become commonplace in education discussions as a reference to the shortage of skilled workers and inadequate education in these areas. The term tends not to refer to the non-professional and less visible sectors of the fields, such as electronics assembly line work. National Science Foundation[] Many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the on what constitutes a STEM field. The NSF uses a broader definition of STEM subjects that includes subjects in the fields of , and science, engineering, geosciences, life sciences, mathematical sciences, physics and astronomy, (, , and ), and STEM education and learning research. The NSF is the only American federal agency whose mission includes support for all fields of fundamental science and engineering, except for medical sciences. Its disciplinary program areas include scholarships, grants, fellowships in fields such as biological sciences, computer and and engineering, education and human resources, engineering, environmental research and education, geosciences, international science and engineering, mathematical and physical sciences, social, behavioral and economic sciences, cyberinfrastructure, and polar programs. Immigration policy[] Why must students pretend they don't dream of staying and working here, and why must the US pretend it doesn't need them? Moumita Das Although many organizations in the United States follow the guidelines of the on what constitutes a STEM field, the (DHS) has its own functional definition used for immigration policy. In 2012, DHS or ICE announced an expanded list of STEM designated-degree programs that qualify eligible graduates on student visas for an optional practical training (OPT) extension. Under the OPT program, international students who graduate from colleges and universities in the United States can stay in the country and receive up to twelve months of training through work experience. Students who graduate from a designated STEM degree program can stay for an additional seventeen months on an OPT STEM extension. As of 2023, the U.S. faces a shortage of high-skilled workers in STEM, and foreign talents must navigate difficult hurdles in order to immigrate. Meanwhile, some other countries, such as Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, have introduced programs to attract talents at the expense of the United States. In the case of China, the United States risks losing its edge over . STEM-eligible degrees in US immigration[] An exhaustive list of STEM disciplines does not exist because the definition varies by organization. The lists disciplines including , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . Education[] See also: By cultivating an interest in the natural and social sciences in preschool or immediately following school entry, the chances of STEM success in high school can be greatly improved.[] STEM supports broadening the study of within each of the other subjects, and beginning engineering at younger grades, even elementary school. It also brings STEM education to all students rather than only the gifted programs. In his 2012 budget, President Barack Obama renamed and broadened the ""Mathematics and Science Partnership (MSP)"" to award block grants to states for improving teacher education in those subjects. Healthcare and STEM, especially computer science, grew in popularity while the liberal arts and social studies, especially history, have declined due to market forces. In the 2015 run of the international assessment test the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), American students came out 35th in mathematics, 24th in reading and 25th in science, out of 109 countries. The United States also ranked 29th in the percentage of 24-year-olds with science or mathematics degrees. STEM education often uses new technologies such as to encourage interest in STEM fields. STEM education can also leverage the combination of new technologies, such as and , with old technologies such as systems and within environments. In 2006 the expressed their concern about the declining state of STEM education in the United States. Its Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy developed a list of 10 actions. Their top three recommendations were to: Increase America's talent pool by improving K–12 science and mathematics education Strengthen the skills of teachers through additional training in science, mathematics and technology Enlarge the pipeline of students prepared to enter college and graduate with STEM degrees The also has implemented programs and curricula to advance STEM education in order to replenish the pool of scientists, engineers and mathematicians who will lead space exploration in the 21st century. Individual states, such as , have run pilot after-school STEM programs to learn what the most promising practices are and how to implement them to increase the chance of student success. Another state to invest in STEM education is Florida, where Florida Polytechnic University, Florida's first public university for engineering and technology dedicated to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), was established. During school, STEM programs have been established for many districts throughout the U.S. Some states include , , , , , and . Continuing STEM education has expanded to the post-secondary level through masters programs such as the University of Maryland's STEM Program as well as the University of Cincinnati. Racial gap in STEM fields[] Main article: Significant race or sex differences exist in the completion of Algebra I. In the United States, the National Science Foundation found that the average science score on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress was lower for black and Hispanic students than white, Asian, and Pacific Islanders. In 2011, eleven percent of the U.S. workforce was black, while only six percent of STEM workers were black. Though STEM in the U.S. has typically been dominated by white males, there have been considerable efforts to create initiatives to make STEM a more racially and gender diverse field. Some evidence suggests that all students, including black and Hispanic students, have a better chance of earning a STEM degree if they attend a college or university at which their entering academic credentials are at least as high as the average student's. Gender gaps in STEM[] Although women make up 47% of the workforce in the U.S., they hold only 24% of STEM jobs. Research suggests that exposing girls to female inventors at a young age has the potential to reduce the gender gap in technical STEM fields by half. Campaigns from organizations like the aimed to achieve a 50/50 gender balance in their youth STEM programs by 2020. American Competitiveness Initiative[] In the on January 31, 2006, President announced the . Bush proposed the initiative to address shortfalls in federal government support of educational development and progress at all academic levels in the STEM fields. In detail, the initiative called for significant increases in federal funding for advanced programs (including a doubling of federal funding support for advanced research in the physical sciences through ) and an increase in U.S. higher education graduates within STEM disciplines. The NASA Means Business competition, sponsored by the Texas Space Grant Consortium, furthers that goal. College students compete to develop promotional plans to encourage students in middle and high school to study STEM subjects and to inspire professors in STEM fields to involve their students in outreach activities that support STEM education. The has numerous programs in STEM education, including some for K–12 students such as the ITEST Program that supports The Global Challenge Award ITEST Program. STEM programs have been implemented in some schools. They implement higher cognitive skills for students and enable them to inquire and use techniques used by professionals in the STEM fields. (PLTW) is a provider of STEM education curricular programs to middle and high schools in the United States. Programs include a high school engineering curriculum called Pathway To Engineering, a high school biomedical sciences program, and a middle school engineering and technology program called Gateway To Technology. PLTW programs have been endorsed by President and as well as various state, national, and business leaders.[] STEM Education Coalition[] The Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Coalition works to support STEM programs for teachers and students at the , the , and other agencies that offer STEM-related programs. Activity of the STEM Coalition seems to have slowed since September 2008. Scouting[] In 2012, the began handing out awards, titled NOVA and SUPERNOVA, for completing specific requirements appropriate to scouts' program level in each of the four main STEM areas. The has similarly incorporated STEM into their program through the introduction of merit badges such as ""Naturalist"" and ""Digital Art"". is an international organization, solutions'provider specialized on supporting education, award and scholarship programs for STEM matters, from pre-K to the college degree. It also promotes scientific and technologic innovation. Department of Defense programs[] The is a free, web-based science, mathematics and technology competition for students in grades six through nine sponsored by the U.S. Army. Each is focused on a different step of the scientific method and is presented by an experienced eCybermission CyberGuide. CyberGuides are military and civilian volunteers with a strong background in STEM and STEM education, who are able to provide insight into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics to students and team advisers. is an educational program, sponsored by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs. Students interact with military personnel to explore careers and make connections with the ""real world"". The program provides students with 20–25 hours of experience at , , , and bases across the nation. is an underwater robotics program that trains teachers to teach their students how to build an underwater remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in an in-school or out-of-school setting. Students build the ROV from a kit composed of low-cost, easily accessible parts, following a curriculum that teaches basic engineering and science concepts with a marine engineering theme. NASA[] STEM Girls' Night In at the NASA's , Greenbelt, Maryland (2018) NASAStem is a program of the U.S. to increase diversity within its ranks, including age, disability, and gender as well as race/ethnicity. Legislation[] The (P.L. 110–69) became law on August 9, 2007. It is intended to increase the nation's investment in science and engineering research and in STEM education from kindergarten to graduate school and postdoctoral education. The act authorizes funding increases for the , laboratories, and the (DOE) Office of Science over FY2008–FY2010. Robert Gabrys, Director of Education at NASA's , articulated success as increased student achievement, early expression of student interest in STEM subjects, and student preparedness to enter the workforce. Jobs[] In November 2012 the announcement before congressional vote on the STEM Jobs Act put President Obama in opposition to many of the Silicon Valley firms and executives who bankrolled his re-election campaign. The Department of Labor identified 14 sectors that are ""projected to add substantial numbers of new jobs to or affect the growth of other industries or are being transformed by technology and innovation requiring new sets of skills for workers."" The identified sectors were as follows: , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . The notes STEM fields careers are some of the best-paying and have the greatest potential for job growth in the early 21st century. The report also notes that STEM workers play a key role in the sustained growth and stability of the U.S. economy, and training in STEM fields generally results in higher wages, whether or not they work in a STEM field. In 2015, there were around 9.0 million STEM jobs in the United States, representing 6.1% of American employment. STEM jobs were increasing around 9% percent per year. Brookings Institution found that the demand for competent technology graduates will surpass the number of capable applicants by at least one million individuals. According to Pew Research Center, a typical STEM worker earns two-thirds more than those employed in other fields. Trajectories of STEM graduates in STEM and non-STEM jobs[] According to the 2014 US census ""74 percent of those who have a bachelor's degree in science, technology, engineering and math — commonly referred to as STEM — are not employed in STEM occupations."" Updates[] In September 2017, a number of large American technology firms collectively pledged to donate 200 million (grant funding) on STEM education every year. This budget also supports STEM through a grant program worth 5,000,000 project funded by the National Science Foundation in 1998. Managed by the STEM Education Institute at UMass and the Five Colleges School Partnership Program, the collaborative included the Five Colleges--Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and UMass Amherst--plus Greenfield, Holyoke, and Springfield Technical Community Colleges, and several regional school districts. .

0,utep,What is STEM Education and Why is it Important?,https://www.utep.edu/extendeduniversity/utepconnect/blog/december-2021/what-is-stem-education-and-why-is-it-important.html,"STEM Education? It would be inaccurate to assume that STEM education is merely instruction in the STEM subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Rather, the idea is taken a step further. STEM education refers to the integration of the four subjects into a cohesive, interdisciplinary and applied learning approach. This isn’t academic theory—STEM education includes the appropriate real-world application and teaching methods. As a result, students in any subject can benefit from STEM education. That’s exactly why some educators and organizations refer to it as STEAM, which adds in arts or other creative subjects. They recognize just how powerful the philosophy behind STEM education can be for students. Why Is STEM Education Important? There are several layers to explore in discovering why STEM education is so important. Background In 2018, the White House released the “Charting a Course for Success” that illustrated how far the United States was behind other countries in STEM education. It found that only 20% of high school grads were ready for the rigors of STEM majors. And how over the previous 15 years, the U.S. had produced only 10% of the world’s science and engineering grads. Since the founding of the Nation, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have been a source of inspirational discoveries and transformative technological advances, helping the United States develop the world's most competitive economy and preserving peace through strength. The pace of innovation is accelerating globally, and with it the competition for scientific and technical talent. Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and securit —depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem. - Charting a Course for Success That was one of the most news-worthy developments in recent years. It set the stage for many arguments behind STEM in the context of the global economy and supporting it through education. Job Outlook and Salary One of the most direct and powerful arguments for the importance of STEM education is how relevant STEM is in the workforce. In 2018, the Pew Research Center found that STEM employment had grown since 1990 (computer jobs increased 338%). What about now? All occupations are projected to increase 7.7% by 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Non-STEM occupations will increase 7.5% while STEM occupations will increase . The findings are even more pronounced in terms of salary. The median annual wage for all occupations is 40,020 and those in STEM occupations earn $89,780. Even areas like entrepreneurship see the same types of results. A from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) found that tech-based startups pay more than double the national average wage and nearly three times the average overall startup wage. They only make up 3.8% of businesses but capture a much larger share of business research and development investment (70.1%), research and development jobs (58.7%) and wages (8.1%), among other areas. Diversity and Skills An important detail in the passage from “Charting a Course for Success” comes toward the end of the final sentence: “Now more than ever the innovation capacity of the United States—and its prosperity and security—depends on an effective and inclusive STEM education ecosystem.” Being inclusive is incredibly important once you understand how STEM occupations are such high-demand, high-paying positions. Unfortunately, however, diversity is a significant issue here. The Pew Research Center noted how women account for the majority of healthcare practitioners and technicians but are underrepresented across many other STEM fields, especially in computer jobs and engineering. Black and Hispanic workers are also underrepresented in the STEM workforce. In the International Journal of STEM Education, authors noted how women are significantly underrepresented in STEM occupations. They make up of those working in STEM occupations and for women of color, representation is much lower — Hispanic, Asian and Black women receive less than 5% of STEM bachelor’s degrees in the U.S. Authors also pointed out how people of color overall are underrepresented in U.S.-based STEM leadership positions across industry, academia and the federal workforce. These issues are troubling when you consider how it undermines students’ opportunities to pursue high-demand, high-paying roles. Yet, it’s more than that. STEM education is about a teaching philosophy that naturally integrates critical thinking and language skills in a way that enriches any subject. Perhaps you’ve experienced or can imagine an education that integrates problem solving and engineering practices into any subject, where technology is seamlessly integrated throughout. Any subject—art, language, social studies, health—can benefit. So when students don’t receive an effective STEM education, they’re not only receiving less instruction in STEM"

STEM is necessary for growing the economy and staying globally competitive. You've likely heard the term STEM, but what does it stand for? STEM is an acronym for science, technology, engineering, and math. These four fields share an emphasis on innovation, problem-solving, and critical thinking. And together they make up a popular and fast-growing industry. Most STEM workers use computers and other technology in their day-to-day jobs.

It’s also a great way to engage kids in fun activities that will get them excited about learning. By bringing STEM education to the classroom, there are so many opportunities for creative and innovative projects. STEM is an educational philosophy that teaches these subjects together in project-based lessons that resemble challenges students would face in real life outside the classroom. In the real world, there are very few challenges that only require one skill set – without real-world application its difficult to understand how various skills are connected. , for example, use science, math, design, technology, and art to create their final product. You wouldn’t be able to design a new app, video game or computer program without an understanding of all of the STEM concepts. Why STEM is Important? In a world where we can ask Siri, Alexa, or Google to answer our questions, education is no longer about simply knowing the answers. Education in the modern world is knowing which questions to ask and how to think critically when a problem presents itself. With the advancements in technology comes the necessity for young people to learn , , and evaluate the information they’re consuming. STEM helps young people develop the skills to assess what they’re reading and determine its merits. They’re taught how to think critically while problem-solving for real-world solutions. Plus, STEM is inquiry-based – so young people are encouraged to ask questions about the world and seek out their own answers. Benefits of STEM One of the common misconceptions about STEM education is that students need all of the latest technology and gadgets to stay ahead of the curve. While it is true that technology is always changing and growing, STEM isn’t really about having the most expensive equipment. STEM should be focused on problem-solving and exposing young people for a life based in technology. It should prepare them to learn new advancements continuously throughout their lives by giving them the groundwork for what to expect with new tools and programs that will be developed in their future. You don’t even need fancy technology to learn to code. Check out some of our best that don’t require a computer! At its roots – STEM is about learning how to learn and adapt. STEM encourages risk-taking through teamwork, communication, and collaboration in an environment where it’s safe to fail and learn from mistakes. Students learn to be creative and innovative while completing projects from start to finish. When students learn through STEM projects they’re building skills of determination and perseverance through difficult tasks. Benefits of Early STEM Education It is never too early to start with STEM-based activities in early education. Young children learn through play and utilizing their senses. The perfect example of an appropriate lesson plan is using traditional teaching methods like story time and integrating activities based on creative exploration. Maybe you read “The Three Little Pigs” and ask your students to use materials found in nature to build houses. Or using the story of “Humpty Dumpty” to have students build a wall solid enough to sustain the weight of an egg. You can take the lessons further by helping them use the scientific method to test their hypothesis. Will this wall sustain Humpty’s weight? Let’s find out and explore how they could have improved upon their designs. In both examples, you’re asking them to integrate their creative skills to solve a problem. Coding can be taught to young kids as well! Here are What is STEAM? STEAM adds in the letter A for art because they like to emphasize the creative and problem-solving process that comes with STEM education. Some educators argue that it’s innate in the application of STEM coursework but others argue that highlighting the arts within these lessons is necessary so we do not forget the importance of creative exploration in the problem-solving process. Why Coding is Important in STEM We interact with code dozens of times before we leave our houses in the morning. From shutting off the alarm clock to checking our phones in the morning to using the microwave to heat up our food. Computer programmers are one of the most in-demand professions today. Over 50% of the fastest growing jobs in the US are in STEM education fields. Our young people need to understand how things work, how they break, and how they fix them. Contrary to popular belief coding itself is not difficult, the difficulty lies in debugging coding errors. When students learn to debug their code, they’re learning the process of finding solutions to their errors and being able to view things through a critical problem-solving lens. It helps them apply those same skill sets throughout their lives. In fact, there are many It builds independence, , and the ability to be critical of their own efforts.

The article culminates with the roles teaches play in STEM education. ______________________________________________________________________________ Introduction What is this term they call STEM education? Most people are in the dark and moreover, most educators and students are as well. When one hears the acronym “STEM” within an educational setting, they may think along the lines of stem cell research or something dealing with flowers (Angier, 2010). However, STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. On January 25, 2011, the first sitting President of the United States spoke the words “Science, Technology, Engineering and Math” in his State of the Union Address The President stated: Let's also remember that after parents, the biggest impact on a child's success comes from the man or woman at the front of the classroom. In South Korea, teachers are known as ""nation builders."" Here in America, it's time we treated the people who educate our children with the same 2 level of respect. (Applause.) We want to reward good teachers and stop making excuses for bad ones. (Applause.) And over the next 10 years, with so many baby boomers retiring from our classrooms, we want to prepare 100,000 new teachers in the fields of science and technology and engineering and math (Whitehouse.gov, 2011). This was a milestone for STEM Education, but it is not a new concept derived by the White House. STEM Education (in one form or another) has been around for decades; however, legislators and educational administrators are now recognizing its importance. This research will attempt to provide a clear definition of STEM through a historical narrative as well as contemporary aspects in which STEM is being implemented. The initial knee-jerk reaction of people who have heard of STEM (in an educational setting) but don’t know the history and contemporary implementation of STEM education is that STEM has something to do with science and/or computers. While science and computers are a part of STEM, they are educational mechanisms and concepts that are used by STEM stakeholders to implement and/or produce a STEM outcome. Historical Aspects STEM Education was originally called Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) (Sanders, 2009), and was an initiative created by the National Science Foundation (NSF). This educational initiative was to provide all students with critical thinking skills that would make them creative problem solvers and ultimately more marketable in the workforce. It is perceived that any student who participates in STEM Education, particularly in the K-12 setting would have an advantage if they chose not to pursue a post-secondary education or would have an even greater advantage if they did attend college, particularly in a STEM field (Butz et al., 2004). Although the use of STEM concepts (historically) were being implemented in many aspects of the business world; i.e., the Industrial Revolution, Thomas Edison and other inventors, it was not being utilized in traditional educational settings. The use of STEM was primarily used in engineering firms to produce revolutionary technologies such as the light bulb, automobiles, tools and machines, etc. Many of the people responsible for these innovations were only slightly educated and/or were in some type of apprenticeship. For example, Thomas Edison did not attend college (Beals, 2012), nor did Henry Ford; although Ford did work for Thomas Edison for a number of years. These “giants” of innovation used STEM principles to produce some of the most prolific technologies in history: however, STEM in education was virtually non-existent (Butz et al., 2004). STEM Education was the result of several historical events. Most notable was the Morrill Act of 1862. This Act was responsible for the development of land grant universities that, in the beginning, focused mostly on agricultural training, but soon engineering based training programs formed (Butz et al., 2004). For example, The Ohio State University was established in 1870, but 3 was originally named the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (Background of Ohio State, 2012). As more and more land grant institutions were being established, more and more STEM Education training was ultimately being taught and eventually assimilated into the workforce. Other historical events pushed STEM Education to grow and flourish. Two such events were World War II, and the launch of the, then, Soviet Union’s Sputnik. World War II The technologies invented and implemented during WWII are almost immeasurable. From the Atomic Bomb (and other types of weaponry) to synthetic rubber to numerous types of transportation vehicles (both land and water), it was clear that American innovation was flourishing. Scientists, mathematicians, and engineers (many from academia) worked hand-in-hand with the military to produce innovative products that helped win the war and to further STEM Education (Judy, 2011). It must also be noted that the NSF was formed at the end of the WWII in an effort to not only recognize the immense contribution of the talented men and women who created prolific commodities, but to preserve the research and documentation of those commodities (Mervis, 2010). Sputnik In 1957, the (then) Soviet Union attempted and was successful in launching Sputnik 1. This was a satellite that was the size of a beach ball and orbited the earth in about an hour and a half. This was a technological milestone that started the “Space Race” between the United States and the Soviet Union. The significance of this event propelled the United States to look at initiating and furthering technological advances in terms of space travel and exploration. “The Sputnik launch changed everything. As a technical achievement, Sputnik caught the world's attention and the American public off-guard” (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2008, p.1). Sputnik became a national defense issue and in 1958, Congress passed the “Space Act” that formed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). NASA’s mission was to “expand and improve” the United States space presence and to use science and engineering in the most effective ways to complete that mission (Dick, 2008). Since the birth of NASA, the space industry obviously has thrived and produced several technological triumphs including putting a man on the moon; however, NASA has been responsible for many STEM Education initiatives. Funding through NASA grants has been responsible for bringing STEM Education initiatives to both pre and post secondary education for the past five decades. During summer 2010, more than 150 events, led by NASA Centers and 130 participating partners from across the Nation, engaged over 150,000 students in NASA experiences. Of these, nearly 22,000 students received at least 40 hours of STEM engagement and instruction (NASA 2012, p.12). 4 Sputnik’s effect on the United State’s demonstrative affect of the promotion of STEM Educational endeavors (most notably NASA), in addition to STEM industry advancements is immeasurable. Kelly (2012) states: Americans were shocked when the Russians put the Sputnik satellite into space in 1957 and grabbed a lead in global technology. We responded with a massive push to upgrade math and science education. The problem now is no less urgent. While our interest has diminished, the rest of the world's has grown (p.1). Although Kelly’s (2012) assertions may be true, the government and industry leaders are taking steps to produce more STEM educators at all levels through scholarships and grants. Contemporary Aspects of STEM Education Although history has played and continues to play a part in STEM Education, there are many variations and opinions of what STEM Education is and how it should be taught. This section will attempt to wade through the complexities of STEM in education fields and how they are imparted to students and other stakeholders. STEM Fields Defined The four strands of STEM; Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, have been staple forms of all students’ academic careers; particularly science and mathematics. They are defined as: Science: the systematic study of the nature and behavior of the material and physical universe, based on observation, experiment, and measurement, and the formulation of laws to describe these facts in general terms (Science, 2012). Technology: the branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the environment, drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts, engineering, applied science, and pure science (Technology, 2012). Engineering: the art or science of making practical application of the knowledge of pure sciences, as physics or chemistry, as in the construction of engines, bridges, buildings, mines, ships, and chemical plants (Engineering, 2012). Mathematics: a group of related sciences, including algebra, geometry, and calculus, concerned with the study of number, quantity, shape, and space and their interrelationships by using a specialized notation (Mathematics, 2012). Although these definitions are the well known usual and/or established descriptive terms for STEM fields, there is obviously more to them. Science and Mathematics are at the forefront of STEM Education mainly because these are the most recognizable fields that most people can relate to in terms of academia. Technology and Engineering are the fields that are not only the most underrepresented, but also the most underfunded in education, specifically in the k-12 arena 5 (Miaoulis, 2011). The question is how do those in education interpret and integrate into their classrooms? What about the “T and E” of STEM Education? The “T and E” of STEM Education appears to be a stumbling block to producing a meaningful STEM experience to k-12 education students. There are several possible reasons for this and are as follows: 1) As mentioned Science and Mathematics are the most recognizable fields in STEM Education and most educators in these areas feel comfortable teaching them. 2) Many educators that are not in the fields Engineering and/or Technology are intimidated with processes that are associated with them. 3) Although Engineering is a recognizable word that most educators can somewhat relate, many who are not in the field(s) are not sure what engineers actually do in terms of education. 4) Many consider Technology as just a computer related field. 5) Many educators are comfortable in their fields and create “educational silos” Technology and Education Defined Technology Education has a long and rich history not only nationally, but globally as well. As society evolved from the Agrarian Age, to the Industrial Revolution and now the Information Age, through several paradigm shifts, Technology Education has grown and expanded and is now in the midst of yet another paradigm shift. The current shift is aligning science, engineering and mathematics with Technology Education in what is called the integrative STEM initiative (Sanders, 2009). An extra emphasis on engineering specifically is also being called for by many technology educators. Furthermore, the trend indicates that several institutions of higher learning are changing the names of their programs to Engineering and Technology Education. In most dictionaries, technology is defined as “applications of tools and methods” or something similar. To the general public, and especially in education, the term technology is spelled “c-o-m-p-u-t-e-r-s,” equating “technology” to one technological tool. A computer is a tool, but provides a very narrow view of the scope of technology as a whole. Computers are definitely one form or type of technology, but technology is much, much more than computers alone. Technology encompasses several different constructs that have been categorized by several state and national programs, organizations and standards. They include: Bio and Medical Technologies, Construction, Engineering and Manufacturing Technologies, Electronics, Energy and Power, Information Technologies and Transportation. Within these constructs are a plethora of sub-technologies. For example, Energy and Power technologies can include sub-technologies from automobile engines to green energy sources such as solar and wind energy. Technology and Engineering Education Defined The Technology for All Americans Project (ITEEA, 2011) that is sanctioned by the International Technology and Engineering Education Association (ITEEA) which sets standards 6 for the study of technology and engineering, defines technology as “how humans modify the world around them to meet their needs and wants or to solve practical problems.” Thus, Technology and Engineering Education is problem-based learning by students utilizing math, science, engineering and technology principles. These studies involve: • Designing, developing, and utilizing technological systems • Open-ended, problem-based design activities • Cognitive, manipulative, and effective learning strategies • Applying technological knowledge and processes to real world experiences using up-to-date resources • Working individually as well as in a team to solve problems (ITEEA, 2011) The Difference Between Technology Education and Educational Technology As stated, Technology Education is problem-based learning by students utilizing math, science, engineering, and technology principles. Educational Technology (also referred to as Instructional Technology) is the use of technology to educate students. Seels and Richey (1994), state: “Instructional Technology is the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management and evaluation of processes and resources for learning.” (p. 6) Thus, Educational Technology uses technology (mainly computer-based) in pedagogical methods of instruction and assessment. This can include the use of PowerPoint, Blackboard, digital assessment programs, Web searches, DVDs and videos in addition other instructional multimedia. Technology Education teachers may use educational technology to deliver lessons and for assessment; however, the confusion between the two disciplines is clearly a problem for most educators. The ITEEA and other leaders in Technology and Engineering Education recently made a name change from “Technology Education” to “Technology and Engineering Education” in an attempt to alleviate the confusion and have a solid identity within the educational community. Overarching Goals of Technology and Engineering Education in Pre and Post-Secondary Schools The overarching goal for Technology and Engineering Education is to make all citizens technologically literate (ITEEA, 2011). This can be accomplished through technology and engineering education alone, but also by integrating math and science principles into technology/engineering education programs. This is being done not only in the State level, but nationally as well (Brown, Brown, Reardon, & Merrill, 2011). The overarching goals of Technology and Engineering Education in k-12 education The overarching goals of Technology and Engineering Education in post-secondary schools are to produce certified Technology and Engineering Education teachers that are equipped with the knowledge, skills and dispositions to be effective educators and leaders. 7 What is a STEM Educator? STEM can have different meaning to different people. STEM in higher education is somewhat straightforward. A student enrolled in a STEM related program, other than teacher education, is in a stand-alone STEM field. For example, if a student is majoring molecular biology, they will enter the STEM workforce as a scientist. They may or may not be exposed to technology, engineering or mathematics that specifically pertains to their field, but chances are they will be exposed in some way shape or form. Therefore, integration in terms of STEM may or may not occur; however, it must be noted they are within a STEM field. This is not the case with teacher education. Consider a High School Science Teacher that just teaches science, but does not integrate technology, engineering or math into their curriculum or that do not collaborate with other STEM faculty. Although this teacher is in a STEM field the fact that they do not integrate or collaborate makes them just a science teacher, not a STEM educator. This is true with all teachers with the STEM field who teach k-12 education. Conclusion The consensus of the literature indicates that integrative and/or collaborative STEM education is a viable endeavor that will introduce k-12 students to STEM concepts (Barakos, Lujan, & Strang, 2012; Brown, Brown, Reardon, & Merrill, 2011). These concepts may lead to the student perusing a STEM major in higher education and ultimately chose a STEM career within the workforce. Barkos et al. (2012), stated: Perhaps for the first time since the launch of Sputnik, educators broadly agree on the value of STEM education for ensuring America’s edge in the global economy. Yet teachers, administrators, and policy-makers find themselves confused about what it means to successfully implement STEM programs and initiatives (p.2). It appears the there is a great need for all stakeholders to come to an agreement of what STEM education is and how the dissemination regarding education might be standardized? References Angier, N.

This study aimed to examine the reflections of the ""Early Childhood STEM Teacher Training Program"" on early childhood teachers. The participants of the study consisted of 12 pre-school teachers determined by the snowball sampling method. This research, in which a mixed experimental design was used, had quantitative and qualitative dimensions. The quantitative dimension of the study investigated the effects of the teacher training program on the attitudes of early childhood teachers towards STEM education, STEM practices self-efficacy, and instructional beliefs, with the discrete-time series design, which is one of the semi-experimental design types. In the qualitative dimension, the teachers' experiences, and perceptions about these experiences were explored through using phenomenology design. The STEM education program is a 12-week program consisting of 9 modules, 43 activities, and 22 sessions. Modules consisted of a presentation, activities, discussion, action planning, and evaluation sections. Each module focused on a different aspect of early STEM education. These dimensions included the basic concepts of STEM education, the content of STEM disciplines, use of illustrated children's books, STEM outside the classroom, coding and robotic practices, engineering practices with children, organizing learning centers, family participation, and evaluation. Before implementing the training program, pre-test data were collected by using the self-evaluation form, module outcomes self-evaluation form, teacher beliefs questionnaire, STEM education practices self-efficacy scale, attitude scale towards STEM education, module evaluation form, observer evaluation form, and semi-structured interview form. After the implementation of the training program, the same measurement tools were applied again for the purpose of post-test assessment. In addition, the STEM activities prepared by the teachers for children during the education process were evaluated through the ""activity evaluation form"". Quantitative data were analyzed by employing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and qualitative data were analyzed by content analysis. Results showed that the curriculum had positive effects on participant teachers' attitudes towards STEM education, STEM practices self-efficacy, and instructional beliefs. In the study, there were statistically and significantly difference between the pre and post-test measures of the meaningfulness and feasibility scores of the teachers' attitude towards STEM education's sub-dimensions. In the study, it was determined that there was a statistically significant difference between the pre and post-test measures of the meaningfulness and feasibility scores of the teachers' attitude towards STEM education's sub-scales. The difference was in favor of the posttest measurements. It was found that there is a statistically significant difference between the pre-test and post-test measures of the scores of constructivist beliefs and traditional beliefs, which are sub-dimensions of the instructional belief scale, in favor of the post-test for constructivist beliefs and the pre-test for traditional beliefs. In addition, it was determined that the training program influenced participant teachers' perspectives on STEM education, supporting their acquisitions of content, 21st century, pedagogy, context and integration knowledge, and skills, increased their awareness of the importance of STEM education in early childhood, and affected their perceptions about STEM teachers. The findings indicate that STEM teacher training had positive reflections on early childhood teachers.

However, there are limited studies on the impact of exposure to integrated STEM education on academic achievement and an even lesser amount on performance among underrepresented minority (URM) groups. Students exposed to STEM programming in middle school are more likely to pursue a STEM field in college or a STEM-related career. However, despite increases in middle school STEM programming initiatives, STEM college graduation rates have declined, particularly among URM populations. This meta-analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of STEM education in middle school, focusing on URM students. Results A total of 20 studies containing 45 independent samples met the study criteria. The studies included were published from January 1, 2011 to May 1, 2022, and identified from the following academic databases: ERIC, Google Scholar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, and SCOPUS. Integrated STEM programming was most impactful when: engineering was incorporated into science courses and at full STEM integration, occurring over one academic year (d = 0.89) and occurring in 8th grade (d = 1.55).

STEM education is used to describe an emphasis on the teaching of, and the learning within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (Gonzalez and Kuenzi, 2012). While the concept of STEM education has been around since before the 1990s (Sanders, 2009, Springer, Stanne and Donovan 1999, McClam and Flores-Scott, 2012, Stanne and Donovan 1999, Wells, 2008, White, 2014, Gonzalez and Kuenzi, 2012, Zollman, 2012, a focus on STEM rose to prominence in the US educational arena in response to the ongoing low Mathematics and Science scores compared to international cohorts in international comparative assessments such as TIMSS and PISA, suggesting that US students would not be able to compete on a global scale when subsequently entering the workforce (Wang et al., 2011, McClam and Flores-Scott, 2012, Marinova and McGrath, 2004, Klein, 2008, Gonzalez and Kuenzi, 2012, Breiner et al., 2012, Savage, 2012, Roehrig et al., 2012. In more recent times, this has been a particularly pertinent focus for education as increasingly employment, irrespective of the field or level, requires STEM knowledge and capabilities (Corlu et al., 2014, Breiner et al., 2012, Al Salami et al., 2017. ...ThesisFull-text availableOct 2018This thesis examines the evolution of the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) approach to education, from its beginnings as simply a stronger emphasis on developing STEM-related skills in the workforce via traditional silo-based teaching, to a method for encouraging transdisciplinary learning in students. To achieve this, this thesis is divided 3 Sections. The first is a literature review discusses the numerous incarnations of STEM. The inclusion of Arts has become particularly relevant with the reorientation of STEM-based education towards transdisciplinary learning. Despite strong avocation for its implementation however, there is little empirical evidence of such programs’ successful implementation, particularly in terms of an appropriate method of implementation and distinct benefits in terms of learning outcomes. The second component comprises of a systematic review of the implementation of the transdisciplinary paradigm within the high school environment. The objectives were to consolidate the empirical evidence of the impact of transdisciplinary learning on academic outcomes and identify appropriate guidelines for the implementation of transdisciplinary education in high schools. 7 studies were identified which reported significantly improved academic outcomes with most of them utilising either real-world, project-based or problem- based learning methods with a strong emphasis on collaboration between students and the community. The thesis concludes with suggestions for potential directions for research. While the results of this thesis do point toward clear aspects for successful incorporation of transdisciplinary learning in the high school context, only a small portion of all articles relating to transdisciplinary learning (and derivatives) included relevant empirical evidence. In addition, it is worth noting that while standardised and external testing did allow for comparative evidence on students’ improvements, they neglected to assess some of the specific and unique benefits associated with transdisciplinary learning. Both of these areas would provide a rich and fertile ground for future research.Show abstract... 22, número 89 Introducción P ara potenciar la actividad económica, la Fundación Nacional de Ciencias (NFS) de Estados Unidos de Norteamérica, propuso en la primera década de este siglo una agrupación estratégica de la fuerza de trabajo del sector de Ciencias, Tecnología, Ingeniería y Matemáticas -o STEM por sus siglas en inglés-enfocada a la promoción del vínculo entre la industria y la academia (González, 2012).

The proponents of STEM education believe that by increasing math and science requirements in schools, along with infusing technology and engineering concepts, students will perform better and be better prepared for advanced education or jobs in STEM fields (often referred to as the STEM pipeline). The lasting result would be that the United States would again rise to the top of international rankings. While the outcome remains to be seen, many in the field of technology education have taken the idea of STEM education and have attempted to either integrate more math and science into their courses or highlight the ways in which those concepts were already being integrated. The believed benefits of doing so are that students experience real-world problems making more connections to STEM fields and the ever-changing workforce, sparking interest in STEM fields. Creating these links earlier in the students' educational careers could potentially result in an increased number of students entering into fields associated with STEM. This article presents the results of a survey that explored the current teacher and administrator perceptions of STEM education. The research concludes that: (1) STEM education is not well understood; (2) there is not a clear vision for STEM education even amongst those who believe it is important; and (3) there is little evidence that STEM education exists in the school in this survey, based on the lack of collaboration that exists. (Contains 3 figures.)Show abstractArticleJan 2005The size and adequacy of the federal workforce for carrying out scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) activities are ongoing concerns in many policy circles. Experts both inside and outside of government have voiced fears that this workforce is aging and may soon face a dwindling labor pool, a problem that could be compounded by skill shortages in key areas and growing numbers of non-U.S. citizens obtaining STEM degrees in the United States. The authors assess the condition of this workforce, based on the best available data, while focusing on three main areas: trends in the U.S. STEM workforce overall that might affect the federal STEM workforce, workforce-shaping activities in the federal STEM workforce, and legislative and programmatic mechanisms for influencing that workforce.Show abstractArticleJan 2009ArticleNov 1996This report describes the results of the evaluation of the Technology for All Americans Project, Phase 1.

0,geeksforgeeks,What is STEM Education and Why is it Important?,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-stem-education/,"STEM education primarily focuses on hands-on and problem-based learning methodology. STEM emphasizes developing logical and critical thinking skills by allowing students to learn and understand things from the perspective of the real world. STEM education equipped students with the skills that are required to succeed in their respective careers whether it be in jobs, entrepreneurship, etc. Importance Of STEM Education in the 21st Century:With STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), it is not the teaching of one subject but rather the amalgamation of all four subjects as a comprehensive one through an interdisciplinary curriculum. This helps students to deal with real-world situations and apply their learnings to create, innovate and discover new things. Also, it has been proven that students who adopt the STEM learning approach have better possibilities of getting placed at good companies, achieving the goals of their life contributing to the environment, etc.Benefits of STEM Education:As we read above that stem education is quite important these days and has many benefits let’s take a look:1. Enhance Critical ThinkingSTEM education is a very important aspect of student’s life as it teaches them to solve problems effectively. Students who are accustomed to STEM education at an early age learn to analyze challenges and are able to develop strategies to tackle them. 2. Motivates ExperimentingIn the last couple of decades, it has been noticed that STEM education provides a healthy environment and encourages students to try new things. Children who are part of STEM education learn the importance of failure and how to tackle it without getting affected. 3. Teamwork STEM education is best for and it helps students from every level to work together. They come together and find solutions to the problem discuss with each other, record data, give presentations, write reports, etc. In the end, they come to know the importance of working with each other and, flourish in a complete team-building environment. 4. Boosts CuriosityThis is one of the most vital features of STEM education. Students who are made habitual of this type of education since childhood, develop curiosity and innovation as their regular habits. This type of education enhances the critical way of thinking and empowers them to ask questions. 5. Enhances Problem Solving Skills With the enhancement of critical thinking, students also learn problem-solving skills. By adapting STEM education from an early age children learn the ways of examining problems. Children can also create amazing plans to solve problems. Also, it helps students to look at the bigger picture and not from the smaller aspect.Objectives Of STEM Education:These are the objectives of STEM education, take a look:1. Meeting Demand For Highly Skilled ProfessionalsTo stay afloat in the market, companies hire the best talent pool to help them stay competitive and relevant. People with 21st-century skills as well as STEM skills are the most sought-after. According to many researchers, there is a rise in professions that require STEM skills. Besides, who doesn’t want skilled people that would require very less time to adapt to the new environment? Therefore, stem education is playing a crucial role in determining the future of the youth and their employability.2. Skill DevelopmentLiving in the digital age it is pertinent to say that technology has become an integral part of living therefore the students skilled in digital technology are going to be beneficial. Having faced the coronavirus lockdown almost every student was forced to switch to online platforms to impart knowledge. Students are now accustomed to learning online in the comfort of their place. Likewise, STEM education also helps students develop skills like critical thinking, creative thinking, digital literacy, spatial reasoning, etc.3. Helps To Create Equality There is no gender of subjects. However, people attach genders to subjects as well as to occupations. This is one of the major reasons behind the skewed gender ratio as one advance towards executive and leadership roles. This gender gap can be met by introducing STEM courses at an earlier age. Girls along with boys can then develop 21st-century skills and increase their employability rate. Furthermore, providing equal opportunities for each student towards exploring technologies through an integrated and interdisciplinary educational approach will take the world to the next level.Components of STEM Education :#Attentive LearningLearning attentively is quite a vital component of STEM education as it encourages students to think deeply and create a few assumptions in order to memorize things properly. #Personalized System of LearningIn this, there are various methods of learning such as the shift method which is provided by the instructor in this the students have a choice of learning things at their pace, choosing subjects according to their choice, and giving exams accordingly. #Problem-Based LearningThis is a simple way in which students collect various data from the things they come across in their daily life and analyze it. They can come up with different solutions by applying scientific, mathematical, or technological approaches. #Connecting with a Bigger Level of CommunityStudents are made extroverts who can connect with a large number of people and share their ideas with them. It also helps them in learning several new things thus making them ambitious along with taking a look at various perspectives. Pros and Cons of STEM Education:Here are some of the prominent pros and cons of STEM education listed below:Pros of STEM Education:Widens career opportunitiesDevelops resilienceDevelops communication, critical thinking, cognitive skills, etc.Allows to understand the practical application of conceptsHelps in preparing students for future workforceHelps in promoting gender equalityCons of STEM EducationNo proper guidelines/set of protocols Might be costlyRequires a significant amount of timeWhy is STEM Important in Early Childhood Education?Schools play a vital role in imparting knowledge to students. After all, a person spends nearly 1/5th of his/her life going to school. STEM education focuses on building habits that will help children throughout their lives, from critical thinking skills, problem-solving and creative thinking to computation and interpersonal skills. They learn how to apply all of these to their daily life for building a better world around them.1. Elementary SchoolOne might think that students under 5 years of age can do little when it comes to STEM. However, researchers have found that children in this age bracket are exceptionally quick learners and exhibit great creative and technical abilities. Hence, at this stage, a brief introduction to STEM courses along with future career options are discussed. Its primary focus is on standards-based structure, inquiry-based and real-world problem-based learning, connecting all four STEM subjects. The objective is to arouse students’ interest and curiosity to pursue these courses without forcing them.2. Middle SchoolThe courses are designed in such a way that the students are curious to learn more. The objective here is to make them learn ‘how’ to learn not ‘what’ to learn. This enables them to pursue their interests early on while also being aware of the career options available to them after taking STEM courses.3. High SchoolStudents are in their teens during High School. Therefore, this is the time when they are searching for their identity and trying to make career choices. Hence, the programs focus on the application of the subjects in a challenging and rigorous manner. Along with that students are also guided for post-Secondary Education and employment.Making Sense of ‘STEM Education’ in K-12 Contexts:K-12 education is a short form used for classes from kindergarten to 12th grade and STEM has a lot of importance during those years. K-12 STEM education keeps children connected with the real world from a small age. It also helps in motivating students to learn new things, improves their interest, and makes them persistent in completing their tasks. The incorporation of STEM education in K-12 increases the standard of the things taught and helps children to choose careers in STEM-related fields.

Schools & CorporatesTrending QuestionsAboutYouTube channelEventSchools & CorporatesAboutBlogWhat is STEAM Education? Why is it Important?‍STEAM Education is the hot topic for the decade. How did STEAM grow in such popularity in such a short time? Why is it so important for the future? How will my child benefit from STEAM Education?What is STEAM Education?STEM is a discipline that combines Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics into a single subject. ‍STEM is a flexible and adaptable field that meets our worlds’ constant need for scientific, technological, social and economical innovation. Those who study STEM can contribute to many professional sectors such as healthcare workers, software engineers, architects and more!‍Unlike traditional subjects, STEM is usually taught through an applied approach, such as hands-on experiments and simulation projects.‍STEAM is nothing new but just STEM plus an ‘A’ (Arts), simple as that! It is a relatively new concept which was first suggested by scholar Georgette Yakman in 2006. ‍As its components suggest, STEAM focuses not only on technical skills like problem-solving, but also on soft skills like conversation and creativity by cultivating kids’ artistic sense. In short, STEAM is like a progressed version of the original STEM education!‍STEAM education around the worldGovernments around the world have also pushed for the growth of STEAM Education. The UK and US have established organisations and legislation dedicated to promoting STEAM learning in schools. The Hong Kong government has incorporated STEAM into primary schools’ KLA (key learning areas).‍However, there is still a shortage of STEAM talents globally. Less than 20% of US students pursue STEAM-related studies in university, even less so in HK. Less-than-ideal resource distribution and curriculum arrangements causes STEAM Education to be ineffective. Ref: The Importance of STEAM EducationSTEAM Education is important as it nurtures talent to meet an increasingly demanding field. The global technology and innovation sector is growing at rapid rates, and our ever-advancing world needs equally many bright minds to power new innovations.‍On an individual level, childhood STEAM Education is especially beneficial since it teaches kids how the world works, inspiring them to be curious and motivated learners at an early age. ‍Other than that, most well-paying STEAM careers require at least a bachelors’ degree in related subjects. This is why it is even more important for children to be exposed to STEAM Education from a young age!6 Benefits of STEAM Education‍1. Critical Thinking‍Developing critical thinking skills is a core objective of STEAM Education. Instead of spoon feeding (memorizing instead of understanding), your child will have to actively learn and solve problems based on their understanding on the subject. This encourages logical thinking and prepares them well for the workplace.‍2. Fostering Creativity ‍Creativity is another important component of STEAM Education. Just as how our world has finite resources and infinite problems, STEAM Education challenges your child to solve problems with limited resources in order to make them think out-of-the-box. ‍3. Enhance Communication‍Communication is an important skill in STEAM and life in general. STEAM Education trains up your child’s communication skills as they have to discuss complex concepts to their peers. STEAM Education encourages your child to become active listeners and open to others’ ideas, a crucial skill that will last them a lifetime.4. Encourages hands-on learning‍On top of it all, learning STEAM can be very fun! STEAM involves lots of real-world application — that means that your child will be very hands-on, learning through experiments and projects. This type of learning style (learn by doing) encourages children to actively seek knowledge on their own, preparing them to become curious life-long learners. ‍5. Be Future-ready‍STEAM is the subject of the future. Children learn STEAM through research and inquiry, which is a valuable skill in our information age. Your child will be prepared with skills and scientific mindset to be able to succeed in the future.‍6. Introduces STEM careers Aside from the cognitive benefits, STEAM Education also introduces children to interesting STEAM careers at an early age. Your child will find themselves in an ever-growing world of career opportunities for them in the future. In our world where many STEAM positions are in high demand, this may play a positive role in guiding their career paths in the future.‍Scientist at explaining how the lab worksCareers in STEAMSTEAM is a rapidly growing field with an acute shortage of workers. In the UK alone, there is a shortage of 2+ million workers in STEAM-related fields. In the meantime, countless new jobs are being created everyday to power the latest innovations.‍According to a report in 2018, the demand for STEAM jobs in the world would be related to:‍Computing - 71%Traditional Engineering - 16%Physical sciences - 7%Life sciences - 4%Mathematics - 2%‍It makes sense that many computing jobs are needed when we are surrounded everyday with digital technologies. This field deals with anything from the smartphone apps we use everyday to powering electrical vehicles and everything in between. Other STEAM fields are equally as important. They also create innovative technologies that we use to improve our quality of life and prepare for the future. Whether it is to solve climate change, prevent pandemics, creating new healthcare solutions, STEAM plays a crucial role in each.Advantages of a career in STEAM‍Aside from being a meaningful career, STEAM jobs also pay well. Due to its high demand, employers are willing to pay more for STEAM talents to support their causes. ‍‍While a lot of STEAM careers don’t require university degrees, studying in STEM-related subjects in university would be greatly beneficial to students’ career prospects. Particularly, students with a bachelor’s in STEM will find:‍A 26% higher salary in entry level jobs than in non-STEM fields, and2.5 entry-level job postings in STEM compared to non-STEM fields.‍This goes without saying that STEAM is only going to grow bigger and bigger in the future. Careers in STEAM are future-proof — won’t be replaced by robots. Robots will need to be programmed by programmers, and society will never stop needing new technology to solve new problems.‍‍With this in mind, how is the future generation being prepared in schools to take on this challenge?Ref: , STEAM Education in SchoolSTEAM Education is different from traditional education in its hands-on approach. STEAM Education teaches children to apply their knowledge in real-life scenarios and use a scientific mindset in their daily lives. STEAM Education can begin when children are very young:‍‍KindergartenIt is not too early to introduce STEAM to kindergarteners. STEAM at this level should make kids become curious about the world around them. Children can directly interact with STEAM through hands-on experiments. Most importantly, the goal is to show children that STEAM is something they can do with their own hands. That is why the STEAM they learn is level-adjusted. This means the concepts they learn shouldn’t be too hard but could still be explained in detail.Primary SchoolSTEAM Education at a primary school level should be introductory — not too difficult but enough to make students interested. The goal of this stage should be to encourage students’ to think scientifically and apply what they learn in their daily lives. Students should also be introduced to STEAM fields and jobs, and learn how STEAM shapes the world around them.‍Secondary SchoolSTEAM Education at a secondary school level should become more challenging and in-depth. Students at this stage deal with more abstract concepts while applying their knowledge on a greater level. The goal of this stage should be solidifying students’ learning and interest in STEAM. Schools should also give students solid insight, guidance and resources for students to further their studies in TEAM and pursue careers.Ref: Shortcomings of STEAM class in schoolDespite the push from governments around the world to improve STEAM Education, very few students are actually pursuing STEAM in their university studies. ‍In the US, only 18% of students are interested in STEM, and only 16% are well-qualified to study STEM. In Hong Kong, very few students pursue STEM-related subjects from secondary school onwards and even less at university. ‍Teachers often find difficulty in teaching STEAM in their classes since:‍They do not have enough time to teach itThey are not experts in STEAM themselvesAs a result, students have little exposure, training and education in school, therefore becoming uninterested in pursuing STEAM careers.‍STEAM Class provided by Big Bang Academy to Schools as ECAs‍Big Bang Academy is looking to change that.

Interdisciplinary fields such as astrophysics, biochemistry, computer science, robotics, nanotechnology, neurobiology, and many others rely on a strong STEM background. This is why STEM education is an important focus within the education policy of numerous countries to improve their competitiveness in science and technology development. Goals of STEM education STEM education aims at creating a lasting interest and encouraging students to pursue a career in this field. Already at an early level, student engagement and participation is supported. Interactive learning concepts combine different STEM areas in project-based, interdisciplinary approaches to facilitate creative thinking and collaborative learning. Challenges in STEM education STEM disciplines are often perceived by the public as being “too difficult” with many students struggling in the related subjects. Therefore, there are numerous approaches to promote a positive image of STEM. Currently, women and minorities are under-represented in STEM-related fields, which is another challenge that has to be overcome in STEM education. A functioning STEM education concept should address students from different backgrounds, avoid discrimination, and encourage them to break with gender stereotypes. Importance of STEM education As society is now increasingly technology-driven, occupations in STEM-related areas are continuously on the rise and amongst the best-paid and secure jobs. Moreover, fields like accounting, economics, architecture, and urban planning rely on a strong background in mathematics. Chemistry and biology are key for medical research, and engineering competence is needed in many professions that play a major role in modern economies. All in all, a solid STEM education for today’s students is the key to ensuring future sustainable economic growth and competitive advantages, which is why dedicated STEM education programs have been founded across the globe. For example, leading academic institutions such as Harvard, the MIT, Cambridge University, or the Imperial College London provide lectures, workshops, and summer schools for high school students. Other STEM activities are very often connected via regional, national, or global networks such as “STEMnet”, “Teach for All”, or “Empower Women”. Instruments for chemical education One example of such an instrument is the benchtop synthesis reactor , giving young students access to modern laboratory instrumentation. Convective heating technology makes the reactor compact, which saves lab space while the benefits of accelerated pressurized chemical reactions are maintained in a safe environment. The instrument comes with a dedicated Monowave 50 Teaching Guide, a collection of experiments ready to be implemented in any basic chemistry curriculum. Anton Paar, as the producer and supplier of this cutting-edge benchtop synthesis reactor, fosters STEM activities also at the entry level into the world of sciences.

CloseCross-curricular and integrated learningAddto my notesSTEM EducationShow TranscriptHide Transcript[ASL] K–12 STEM education is the study of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, including cross-curricular and/or integrative study, and the application of those subjects in real-world contexts. As students engage in STEM education, they develop that they need to meet the demands of today’s global economy and society. STEM education helps students develop an understanding and appreciation of each of the core subjects of mathematics, science, and technological education. At the same time, it supports a more holistic understanding and application of skills and knowledge related to engineering design and innovation. STEM learning integrates and applies concepts, processes, and ways of thinking associated with these subjects to design solutions to real-world problems. Engineering design and innovation engages students in applying the principles of science, technology, and mathematics to develop economical and sustainable solutions to technical and complex societal problems to meet human needs. Among the transferable skills developed through STEM education are computational thinking, coding, design thinking, innovating, use of the scientific method, scientific inquiry skills, and engineering design skills. These skills are in high demand in today’s globally connected world, with its unprecedented advancements in technology. Approaches to STEM education may vary across Ontario schools. STEM subjects may be taught separately, but with an effort to make cross-curricular connections a part of student learning. Problem-solving application projects may be designed to combine two or more STEM subjects. Alternatively, content from all four STEM subjects might be fully integrated to reinforce students' understanding of each subject, by enhancing their understanding of the interrelationships among them, and by providing the opportunity to apply a spectrum of knowledge and skills in novel ways in real-world contexts. As STEM education is implemented, it is important to engage diverse perspectives and ways of thinking. including those inherent in the arts and humanities. Diverse perspectives engage students in a variety of creative and critical thinking processes that are essential for developing innovative and effective solutions that impact communities or ecosystems. A robust K–12 STEM education enables Ontario educators and students to become innovators and leaders of change in society and the workforce, and creates opportunities in our diverse communities to foster integrative thinking and problem solving.For parentsSpecialized programs for studentsWhat’s newLet us help youAre you encountering any issues, glitches, accessibility concerns, lack of functionality or other problems on the website?

Importance of STEM Education in Enhancing Student’s Success Toggle navigation Importance of STEM Education in Enhancing Student’s Success 22, July 2021 Quality education is undoubtedly one of the strongest pillars that contribute to an individual’s growth & success. But what are the factors that make education “worth pursuing”? Seymour Papert once quoted - “The role of the teacher is to create the conditions for invention rather than provide ready-made knowledge.” This is exactly what STEM education focuses on! “STEM” stands for Science Technology Engineering Mathematics All these subjects are taught in such a way that students learn to apply the concept in real-time situations. Thus, it promotes cross-disciplinary education & skill development and lays the ground for students’ successful careers. If you are new to the concept of STEM education and want to understand its importance to enhance students’ success, this blog will be your easy guide. Let’s get started. What Is Microlearning? Examples & Benefits Of Microlearning What is STEM Education? As I mentioned, “STEM” education follows a transversal education approach where Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics – all these subjects/courses are taught to develop creativity, critical & logical thinking skills in a student. The students learn to brainstorm & research the concepts of the classroom to find appropriate solutions in real situations. The most effective way to incorporate STEM is to introduce where students are asked to work practically on projects. As an extension to STEM, Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) can also be implemented for skill development & creating self-employment opportunities for the learners. Major Goals & Objectives of STEM Education Now that you have understood the concept of STEM education, let me help you understand the major goals & objectives of STEM. Goal #1: Utilization of Information & Insights STEM aims at enabling students to utilize information & insights on the scientific field, technological area, engineering & mathematics. The concept allows students to explore a wide range of content & projects. Goal #2: Implementation of the Best Practices Students must be able to implement the best practices in all the disciplines of STEM. The long-term aim is to develop a stronger aptitude for these four disciplines. Goal #3: Knowledge Acquisition & Creativity The students should acquire knowledge in the four STEM areas and become capable of innovating new ideas. To sum up the three major goals, I would like to quote an example here. Example: Teachers may ask engineering students to prepare an “L-shaped” wooden tool in the lab. Here, the students may approach the teachers for references. Additionally, they may visit a carpenter to understand the process that goes around creating the tool such as – Learning about various materials Choosing the right material Working on the project Filing & angle cutting Finishing the job This way, students get an opportunity to explore their options by – RESEARCHING + THINKING + APPLYING = CREATING Importance of STEM Education “Why only STEM?” “Why not any other educational approach?” “What is the importance of STEM education?” Such questions are obvious when educators are on a verge of making decisions that could impact your institution. If you are an educator and confused about the same, I would like to showcase some facts & statistics to make your decision easier. According to “By the year 2024, nearly 2.5 million jobs related to Science, Engineering, Technology, and Research will be available!” A big figure indeed! Thus, what you teach your students today can directly impact their careers! To reduce the gender gap and provide equal opportunities to girls in STEM professions, the internationally renowned organization “UNESCO” is also working towards the goal of implementing STEM education. If you adopt the STEM education approach, there will be a greater possibility of your students developing skills & getting placed in reputed organizations contributing their mutual growth, irrespective of their gender. What Is AICTE: Role Of All India Council For Technical Education (AICTE) Benefits of STEM Education The following are the top 5 benefits of STEM education. #1: Transformative Skill-set Development The first & foremost benefit that STEM offers to students is transformative skill-set development. STEM education primarily improves the following skills of students. Creativity Logical thinking Analysis Power Critical thinking Teamwork Innovative mindset #2: Meeting Global Workplace Demands The acceptance of STEM education is not restricted to India. It is globally accepted. A student who has graduated with a STEM approach gets international recognition. He/she can apply for jobs globally since they are capable of meeting the workplace demands. #3: Edge over Traditional Students Since STEM focuses on 4 disciplines particularly – the students get an edge over others who have learned from traditional education setup. Most importantly, when a student with STEM applies for a job, chances are he/she will be hired at a relatively better package due to the acquired skill-set. #4: Inventions in STEM Areas STEM allows students to learn theoretically as well as practically. Both the aspects help students to reach the highest level of education roadmap i.e. “Invention”. STEM enables students to develop an aptitude of a creator. #5: Instills Leadership Quality Over a period, students who have taken the STEM approach to become efficient enough to solve any problem. They take challenges as opportunities to grow – whether – professionally or personally. Thus, it instills leadership quality in the learners. Components of STEM Education Problem-Based Learning In this type of learning, the students collect data, analyze it, come up with scientific explanations and identify the problems to conduct research activities. Further, they develop a prototype to solve the problem and then come up with the best solution for it. This way, students apply mathematics and technology to real-life problems. Rigorous Learning Rigorous learning is a way of learning which is applied to the lessons in such a way that it encourages the students to question their assumptions and think deeply. It keeps them away from learning for memorization and recall of information during the exams. Career, Technology, and Life Skills This involves making the students skillful in the subjects that they are learning. It puts major emphasis on student learning through projects, internships, and hands-on experiences. It aims towards building critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and creativity among the students.

What is photosynthesis? By published November 03, 2022 Photosynthesis is the process plants, algae and some bacteria use to turn sunlight, carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen. Photosynthesis takes in the carbon dioxide produced by all breathing organisms and reintroduces oxygen into the atmosphere. (Image credit: KPG_Payless | Shutterstock) Jump to: Photosynthesis is the process used by plants, algae and some to turn sunlight into energy. The process chemically converts carbon dioxide (CO2) and water into food (sugars) and . The chemical reaction often relies on a pigment called chlorophyll, which gives plants their green color. Photosynthesis is also the reason our planet is blanketed in an oxygen-rich atmosphere.Types of photosynthetic processesThere are two types of photosynthesis: oxygenic and anoxygenic. They both follow very similar principles, but the former is the most common and is seen in plants, algae and cyanobacteria. During oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy transfers electrons from water (H2O) taken up by plant roots to CO2 to produce . In this transfer, the CO2 is ""reduced,"" or receives electrons, and the water is ""oxidized,"" or loses electrons. Oxygen is produced along with carbohydrates.This process creates a balance on Earth, in which the carbon dioxide produced by breathing organisms as they consume oxygen in respiration is converted back into oxygen by plants, algae and bacteria.Anoxygenic photosynthesis, meanwhile, uses electron donors that are not water and the process does not generate oxygen, according to ""Anoxygenic Photosynthetic Bacteria"" by . The process typically occurs in bacteria such as green bacteria and phototrophic purple bacteria. The Photosynthesis equationThough both types of photosynthesis are complex, multistep affairs, the overall process can be neatly summarized as a chemical equation.The oxygenic photosynthesis equation is: 6CO2 + 12H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2OHere, six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) combine with 12 molecules of water (H2O) using light energy. The end result is the formation of a single carbohydrate molecule (C6H12O6, or glucose) along with six molecules each of oxygen and water.Similarly, the various anoxygenic photosynthesis reactions can be represented as a single generalized formula:CO2 + 2H2A + Light Energy → [CH2O] + 2A + H2OThe letter A in the equation is a variable, and H2A represents the potential electron donor. For example, ""A"" may represent sulfur in the electron donor hydrogen sulfide (H2S), according to medical and life sciences news site . How is carbon dioxide and oxygen exchanged? Plants absorb CO2 from the surrounding air and release water and oxygen via microscopic pores on their leaves called stomata. When stomata open, they let in CO2; however, while open, the stomata release oxygen and let water vapor escape. Stomata close to prevent water loss, but that means the plant can no longer gain CO2 for photosynthesis. This tradeoff between CO2 gain and water loss is a particular problem for plants growing in hot, dry environments. How do plants absorb sunlight for photosynthesis?Plants contain special pigments that absorb the light energy needed for photosynthesis.Chlorophyll is the primary pigment used for photosynthesis and gives plants their green color, according to science education site . Chlorophyll absorbs red and blue light and reflects green light. Chlorophyll is a large molecule and takes a lot of resources to make; as such, it breaks down towards the end of the leaf's life, and most of the pigment's nitrogen (one of the building blocks of chlorophyll) is resorbed back into the plant, When leaves lose their chlorophyll in the fall, other leaf pigments such as and anthocyanins begin to show. While carotenoids primarily absorb blue light and reflect yellow, anthocyanins absorb blue-green light and reflect red light, according to Harvard University's .Pigment molecules are associated with proteins, which allow them the flexibility to move toward light and toward one another. A large collection of 100 to 5,000 pigment molecules constitutes an ""antenna,"" according to an article by , a professor at Arizona State University. These structures effectively capture light energy from the sun, in the form of photons.The situation is a little different for bacteria. While cyanobacteria contain chlorophyll, other bacteria, for example, purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria, contain bacteriochlorophyll to absorb light for anoxygenic photosynthesis, according to """" (For Dummies, 2019). Related: Where in the plant does photosynthesis take place?Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts, a type of plastid (an organelle with a membrane) that contains chlorophyll and is primarily found in plant leaves. Chloroplasts are similar to , the energy powerhouses of cells, in that they have their own genome, or collection of genes, contained within circular DNA. These genes that are essential to the organelle and to photosynthesis.Inside chloroplasts are plate-shaped structures called thylakoids that are responsible for harvesting photons of light for photosynthesis, according to the biology terminology website . The thylakoids are stacked on top of each other in columns known as grana. In between the grana is the stroma — a fluid containing enzymes, molecules and ions, where sugar formation takes place. Ultimately, light energy must be transferred to a pigment-protein complex that can convert it to chemical energy, in the form of electrons. In plants, light energy is transferred to chlorophyll pigments. The conversion to chemical energy is accomplished when a chlorophyll pigment expels an electron, which can then move on to an appropriate recipient. The pigments and proteins that convert light energy to chemical energy and begin the process of electron transfer are known as reaction centers.Light-dependent reactionsWhen a photon of light hits the reaction center, a pigment molecule such as chlorophyll releases an electron.The released electron escapes through a series of protein complexes linked together, known as an electron transport chain. As it moves through the chain, it generates the energy to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate, a source of chemical energy for cells) and NADPH — both of which are required in the next stage of photosynthesis in the Calvin cycle. The ""electron hole"" in the original chlorophyll pigment is filled by taking an electron from water. This splitting of water molecules releases oxygen into the atmosphere.Light-independent reactions: The Calvin cycle The Calvin cycle is the three-step process that generates sugars for the plant, and is named after , the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who discovered it decades ago. The Calvin cycle uses the ATP and NADPH produced in chlorophyll to generate carbohydrates. It takes plate in the plant stroma, the inner space in chloroplasts.In the first step of this cycle, called carbon fixation, an enzyme called RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase, also known as rubiso, helps incorporate CO2 into an organic molecule called 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA). In the process, it breaks off a phosphate group on six ATP molecules to convert them to ADP, releasing energy in the process, according to LibreTexts.In the second step, 3-PGA is reduced, meaning it takes electrons from six NADPH molecules and produces two glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) molecules.One of these G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle to do other things in the plant. The remaining G3P molecules go into the third step, which is regenerating rubisco. In between these steps, the plant produces glucose, or sugar.Three CO2 molecules are needed to produce six G3P molecules, and it takes six turns around the Calvin cycle to make one molecule of carbohydrate, according to Khan Academy.Types of photosynthesis There are three main types of photosynthetic pathways: C3, C4 and CAM. They all produce sugars from CO2 using the Calvin cycle, but each pathway is slightly different.C3 photosynthesisMost plants use C3 photosynthesis, according to the photosynthesis research project . C3 plants include cereals (wheat and rice), cotton, potatoes and soybeans. This process is named for the three-carbon compound 3-PGA that it uses during the Calvin cycle. C4 photosynthesisPlants such as maize and sugarcane use C4 photosynthesis. This process uses a four-carbon compound intermediate (called oxaloacetate) which is , according to Biology Online. Malate is then transported into the bundle sheath where it breaks down and releases CO2, which is then fixed by rubisco and made into sugars in the Calvin cycle (just like C3 photosynthesis). C4 plants are better adapted to hot, dry environments and can continue to fix carbon even when their stomata are closed (as they have a clever storage solution), according to Biology Online. CAM photosynthesisCrassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is found in plants adapted to very hot and dry environments, such as cacti and pineapples, according to the Khan Academy. When stomata open to take in CO2, they risk losing water to the external environment. Because of this, plants in very arid and hot environments have adapted. One adaptation is CAM, whereby plants open stomata at night (when temperatures are lower and water loss is less of a risk). According to the Khan Academy, CO2 enters the plants via the stomata and is fixed into oxaloacetate and converted into malate or another organic acid (like in the C4 pathway). The CO2 is then available for light-dependent reactions in the daytime, and stomata close, reducing the risk of water loss.

It is the way in which virtually all energy in the biosphere becomes available to living things. As primary producers, photosynthetic organisms form the base of Earth’s food webs and are consumed directly or indirectly by all higher life-forms. Additionally, almost all the in the atmosphere is due to the process of photosynthesis. If photosynthesis ceased, there would soon be little food or other organic matter on Earth, most organisms would disappear, and Earth’s atmosphere would eventually become nearly devoid of gaseous oxygen. What is the basic formula for photosynthesis?The process of photosynthesis is commonly written as: 6CO2 + 6H2O → C6H12O6 + 6O2. This means that the reactants, six carbon dioxide molecules and six water molecules, are converted by light energy captured by (implied by the arrow) into a sugar molecule and six oxygen molecules, the products. The sugar is used by the organism, and the oxygen is released as a by-product. Read more below: Which organisms can photosynthesize?The ability to photosynthesize is found in both and organisms.

The chemical energy is stored in the form of sugars, which are created from water and carbon dioxide. 3,12,343 Table of Contents Photosynthesis definition states that the process exclusively takes place in the chloroplasts through photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotene and xanthophyll. All green plants and a few other autotrophic organisms utilize photosynthesis to synthesize nutrients by using carbon dioxide, water and sunlight. The by-product of the photosynthesis process is oxygen.Let us have a detailed look at the process, reaction and importance of photosynthesis. What Is Photosynthesis in Biology? The word “photosynthesis” is derived from the Greek words phōs (pronounced: “fos”) and σύνθεσις (pronounced: “synthesis“)Phōs means “light” and σύνθεσις means, “combining together.” This means “combining together with the help of light.” Photosynthesis also applies to other organisms besides green plants. These include several prokaryotes such as cyanobacteria, purple bacteria and green sulfur bacteria. These organisms exhibit photosynthesis just like green plants.The glucose produced during photosynthesis is then used to fuel various cellular activities. The by-product of this physio-chemical process is oxygen. A visual representation of the photosynthesis reaction Photosynthesis is also used by algae to convert solar energy into chemical energy. Oxygen is liberated as a by-product and light is considered as a major factor to complete the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs when plants use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. Leaves contain microscopic cellular organelles known as chloroplasts. Each chloroplast contains a green-coloured pigment called chlorophyll. Light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules whereas carbon dioxide and oxygen enter through the tiny pores of stomata located in the epidermis of leaves. Another by-product of photosynthesis is sugars such as glucose and fructose. These sugars are then sent to the roots, stems, leaves, fruits, flowers and seeds. In other words, these sugars are used by the plants as an energy source, which helps them to grow. These sugar molecules then combine with each other to form more complex carbohydrates like cellulose and starch. The cellulose is considered as the structural material that is used in plant cell walls. Also Read: Where Does This Process Occur? Chloroplasts are the sites of photosynthesis in plants and blue-green algae. All green parts of a plant, including the green stems, green leaves, and sepals – floral parts comprise of chloroplasts – green colour plastids. These cell organelles are present only in plant cells and are located within the mesophyll cells of leaves. Factors Affecting Photosynthesis Photosynthesis process requires several factors such as: Light Intensity: Increased light intensity results in a higher rate of photosynthesis. On the other hand, low light intensity results in a lower rate of photosynthesis. The concentration of CO2: Higher concentration of carbon dioxide helps in increasing the rate of photosynthesis. Usually, carbon dioxide in the range of 300 – 400 PPM is adequate for photosynthesis. Temperature: For efficient execution of photosynthesis, it is important to have a temperature range between 25° to 35° C. Water: As water is an important factor in photosynthesis, its deficiency can lead to problems in the intake of carbon dioxide. The scarcity of water leads to the refusal of stomatal opening to retain the amount of water they have stored inside. Pollution: Industrial pollutants and other particulates may settle on the leaf surface. This can block the pores of stomata which makes it difficult to take in carbon dioxide. Also Read: Photosynthesis Equation Photosynthesis reaction involves two reactants, carbon dioxide and water. These two reactants yield two products, namely, oxygen and glucose. Hence, the photosynthesis reaction is considered to be an endothermic reaction. Following is the photosynthesis formula: 6CO2 + 6H2O —> C6H12O6 + 6O2 Unlike plants, certain bacteria that perform photosynthesis do not produce oxygen as the by-product of photosynthesis. Such bacteria are called anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. The bacteria that do produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis are called oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Photosynthetic Pigments There are four different types of pigments present in leaves: Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll b Xanthophylls Carotenoids Structure Of Chlorophyll The structure of Chlorophyll consists of 4 nitrogen atoms that surround a magnesium atom. A hydrocarbon tail is also present. Pictured above is chlorophyll-f, which is more effective in near-infrared light than chlorophyll-a Chlorophyll is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of the and in the mesosomes of cyanobacteria. This green colour pigment plays a vital role in the process of photosynthesis by permitting plants to absorb energy from sunlight. Chlorophyll is a mixture of chlorophyll-a and chlorophyll-b.Besides green plants, other organisms that perform photosynthesis contain various other forms of chlorophyll such as chlorophyll-c1, chlorophyll-c2, chlorophyll-d and chlorophyll-f. Also Read: Process Of Photosynthesis At the cellular level, the photosynthesis process takes place in cell organelles called chloroplasts. These organelles contain a green-coloured pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for the characteristic green colouration of the leaves. As already stated, photosynthesis occurs in the leaves and the specialized cell organelles responsible for this process is called the chloroplast. Structurally, a leaf comprises a petiole, epidermis and a lamina. The lamina is used for absorption of sunlight and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. Structure of Chloroplast. Note the presence of the thylakoid “Photosynthesis Steps:” During the process of photosynthesis, carbon dioxide enters through the stomata, water is absorbed by the root hairs from the soil and is carried to the leaves through the xylem vessels. Chlorophyll absorbs the light energy from the sun to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen from water molecules and carbon dioxide absorbed from the air are used in the production of glucose. Furthermore, oxygen is liberated out into the atmosphere through the leaves as a waste product. Glucose is a source of food for plants that provide energy for , while the rest is stored in the roots, leaves and fruits, for their later use. Pigments are other fundamental cellular components of photosynthesis. They are the molecules that impart colour and they absorb light at some specific wavelength and reflect back the unabsorbed light. All green plants mainly contain chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b and carotenoids which are present in the thylakoids of chloroplasts. It is primarily used to capture light energy. Chlorophyll-a is the main pigment. The process of photosynthesis occurs in two stages: Light-dependent reaction or light reaction Light independent reaction or dark reaction Stages of Photosynthesis in Plants depicting the two phases – Light reaction and Dark reaction Light Reaction of Photosynthesis (or) Light-dependent Reaction Photosynthesis begins with the light reaction which is carried out only during the day in the presence of sunlight. In plants, the light-dependent reaction takes place in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts. The Grana, membrane-bound sacs like structures present inside the thylakoid functions by gathering light and is called photosystems. These photosystems have large complexes of pigment and proteins molecules present within the plant cells, which play the primary role during the process of light reactions of photosynthesis. There are two types of photosystems: photosystem I and photosystem II. Under the light-dependent reactions, the light energy is converted to ATP and NADPH, which are used in the second phase of photosynthesis. During the light reactions, ATP and NADPH are generated by two electron-transport chains, water is used and oxygen is produced. The chemical equation in the light reaction of photosynthesis can be reduced to: 2H2O + 2NADP+ + 3ADP + 3Pi → O2 + 2NADPH + 3ATP Dark Reaction of Photosynthesis (or) Light-independent Reaction Dark reaction is also called carbon-fixing reaction. It is a light-independent process in which sugar molecules are formed from the water and carbon dioxide molecules. The dark reaction occurs in the stroma of the chloroplast where they utilize the NADPH and ATP products of the light reaction. Plants capture the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through stomata and proceed to the Calvin photosynthesis cycle. In the , the ATP and NADPH formed during light reaction drive the reaction and convert 6 molecules of carbon dioxide into one sugar molecule or glucose. The chemical equation for the dark reaction can be reduced to: 3CO2 + 6 NADPH + 5H2O + 9ATP → G3P + 2H+ + 6 NADP+ + 9 ADP + 8 Pi * G3P – glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Calvin photosynthesis Cycle (Dark Reaction) Also Read: Importance of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis is essential for the existence of all life on earth. It serves a crucial role in the food chain – the plants create their food using this process, thereby, forming the primary producers. Photosynthesis is also responsible for the production of oxygen – which is needed by most organisms for their survival. Frequently Asked QuestionsQ1 1. What is Photosynthesis?

While buried, the carbon in the organic material is removed from the for thousands of years to hundreds of millions of years. The burning of fossil fuels has dramatically increased the exchange of carbon from the ground back into the atmosphere and oceans. This return of carbon back into atmosphere as carbon dioxide is occurring at a rate that is hundreds to thousands of times faster than it took to bury it, and much faster than it can be removed by photosynthesis or . Thus, the carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels is accumulating in the atmosphere, increasing average and causing .

The carbohydrates produced are stored in or used by the plant. Composite image showing the global distribution of photosynthesis, including both oceanic and terrestrial . Dark red and blue-green indicate regions of high photosynthetic activity in the ocean and on land, respectively. Photosynthesis ( FOH-tə-SINTH-ə-sis) is a biological process used by many cellular organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in organic compounds that can later be metabolized through cellular respiration to fuel the organism's activities. The term usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, where oxygen is produced as a byproduct, and some of the chemical energy produced is stored in carbohydrate molecules such as sugars, starch and cellulose, which are synthesized from endergonic reaction of carbon dioxide with water. Most plants, algae and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth. Some also perform , which use to split as a instead of water, and is produced as a byproduct instead of oxygen. such as also perform a type of non- anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler and its are used to absorb green light and power to directly synthesize (ATP). Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis evolved on Earth, going back as far as the , preceding that of cyanobacteria (see ). Although photosynthesis is performed differently by different species, the process always begins when energy from light is absorbed by called that contain or . In plants, these proteins are (a derivative that absorbs the red and blue of , thus reflecting a green color) held inside called , which are most abundant in cells, while in bacteria they are embedded in the . In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two further compounds that serve as short-term stores of energy, enabling its transfer to drive other reactions: these compounds are reduced (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the ""energy currency"" of cells. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of light-independent reactions called the . In the Calvin cycle, atmospheric carbon dioxide is into already existing organic carbon compounds, such as (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as . In other bacteria, different mechanisms such as the are used to achieve the same end. The first photosynthetic organisms probably early in the and most likely used such as or , rather than water, as sources of electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the they produced contributed directly to the , which rendered the possible. Today, the average rate of energy capture by photosynthesis globally is approximately 130 , which is about eight times the current . Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion (91–104 Pg , or billion metric tons), of carbon into per year. That plants receive some energy from light – in addition to air, soil, and water – was first discovered in 1779 by . Photosynthesis is vital for climate processes, as it captures carbon dioxide from the air and then binds carbon in plants and further in soils and harvested products. alone are estimated to bind 3,825 Tg (teragrams) or 3.825 Pg (petagrams) of carbon dioxide every year, i.e. 3.825 billion metric tons. Overview Main article: Photosynthesis changes sunlight into chemical energy, splits water to liberate O2, and fixes CO2 into sugar. Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere. Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen.[] Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called ; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into . Carbon fixation is an reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of : while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism's . Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different .[] The general for photosynthesis as first proposed by is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Aelectron donor + light energy → [CH2O] + 2Aoxidizedelectrondonor + H2Owater Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is: CO2carbondioxide + 2H2Owater + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2oxygen + H2Owater This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the and a product of the , but canceling n water molecules from each side gives the net equation: CO2carbondioxide + H2O water + photonslight energy → [CH2O]carbohydrate + O2 oxygen Other processes substitute other compounds (such as ) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to : The equation for this reaction is: CO2carbondioxide + (AsO3−3)arsenite + photonslight energy → (AsO3−4)arsenate + COcarbonmonoxide(used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions) Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, light-dependent reactions or light reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier and the energy-storage molecule . During the second stage, the light-independent reactions use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide. Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave or, more specifically, far-red radiation. Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis. Photosynthetic membranes and organelles Main articles: and Chloroplast ultrastructure:outer membraneintermembrane spaceinner membrane (1+2+3: envelope)stroma (aqueous fluid)thylakoid lumen (inside of thylakoid)thylakoid membranegranum (stack of thylakoids)thylakoid (lamella)starchribosomeplastidial DNAplastoglobule (drop of lipids) In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in . In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself. However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called , or bunched up into round called intracytoplasmic membranes. These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb. In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in called . A typical contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and complexes of the photosynthetic system. Plants absorb light primarily using the . The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as and . Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as , , and in , in (rhodophytes) and in and resulting in a wide variety of colors. These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a . Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called . Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and , such as many and species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the , can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant that protects the leaf from excessive of water and decreases the absorption of or to minimize . The transparent layer allows light to pass through to the mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place. Light-dependent reactions Main article: Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membrane In the , one molecule of the absorbs one and loses one . This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called , which passes the electron to a molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an that leads to the ultimate reduction of to . In addition, this creates a (energy gradient) across the , which is used by in the synthesis of . The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called , which releases . The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is: 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Not all of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of present. For example, in green plants, the resembles the for and with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms. Z scheme The ""Z scheme"" In plants, occur in the of the where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic. In the non-cyclic reaction, the are captured in the light-harvesting of by and other (see diagram at right). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called . The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an (the so-called Z-scheme shown in the diagram), a is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during , whereas is a product of the terminal reaction in the Z-scheme. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in . There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that . The electron is then passed along a chain of to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the NADP with a H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends. The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name cyclic reaction. Water photolysis Main articles: and Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of are replaced by transfer from , whose electrons come from electron transport through . Photosystem II, as the first step of the Z-scheme, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll a reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic and four ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680+. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four ions and a calcium ion; this binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok's S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for , including photosynthetic organisms. Light-independent reactions Calvin cycle Main articles: and In the (or ""dark"") reactions, the captures from the and, in a process called the , uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is: 128 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → C3H6O3-phosphate + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars produced by photosynthesis are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material , the precursors for and biosynthesis, or as a fuel in . The latter occurs not only in plants but also in when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a . The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which combines with a five-carbon sugar, , to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, , also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of and produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to . This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde () or, more generically, as phosphate. Most (5 out of 6 molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus ""recycled"" often condense to form phosphates, which ultimately yield , and , as well as and . The sugars produced during carbon yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of and . Carbon concentrating mechanisms On land Main articles: , , and Overview of . (This image mistakenly shows lactic acid instead of pyruvate, and all the species ending in ""-ate"" are shown as unionized acids, such as malic acid and so on.) In hot and dry conditions, plants close their to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, CO2 will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of by the activity of and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have mechanisms to increase the CO2 concentration in the leaves under these conditions. Plants that use the carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called , creating the four-carbon organic acid . Oxaloacetic acid or synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized cells where the enzyme and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where CO2 released by of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon . The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases CO2 fixation and, thus, the of the leaf. C4 plants can produce more sugar than C3 plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are C4 plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use C3 carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use C4 carbon fixation; however, the evolution of C4 in over 60 plant lineages makes it a striking example of . , which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to C4 and a useful CCM in its own right. , such as and most , also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called (CAM). In contrast to C4 metabolism, which spatially separates the CO2 fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM temporally separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from C3 plants, and fix the CO2 at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the CO2 mostly in the form of via carboxylation of to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases CO2 inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants. accumulating plants, such as and , show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide () to photosynthetic cells when are partially or totally closed. This process was named . Under stress conditions (e.g. water deficit) oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an and the produced CO2 can support the reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by . Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known and pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere. In water possess , which increase the concentration of CO2 around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, , located within the carboxysome releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO−3). Before the CO2 diffuses out it is quickly sponged up by RuBisCO, which is concentrated within the carboxysomes. HCO−3 ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO−3 ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes. in and also act to concentrate CO2 around RuBisCO. Order and kinetics The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages: Stage Description Time scale 1 Energy transfer in antenna chlorophyll (thylakoid membranes) to 2 Transfer of electrons in photochemical reactions (thylakoid membranes) to 3 Electron transport chain and ATP synthesis (thylakoid membranes) to 4 Carbon fixation and export of stable products to Efficiency Main article: Plants usually convert light into with a of 3–6%. Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) re-emitted as at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers. Actual plants' photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%. By comparison, convert light into at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices. Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield. The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C3 plants. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks. For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction. It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together. Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2, and of ΔH2O using reliable methods CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/(m2/s), parts per million or volume per million and H2O is commonly measured in mmol/(m2/s) or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, ""A"" or carbon assimilation, ""E"" or transpiration, ""gs"" or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO2. However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM' can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations. Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant's photosynthetic response. Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms. While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC to replace Ci. The estimation of CO2 at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, or CC, becomes possible with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system. Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light absorbed by the leaf. But analysis of chlorophyll-fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about e.g. the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength-dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed. A phenomenon known as increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called arranged in an antenna-shaped structure named a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a referred to as an , which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell's metabolism. The exciton's wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously ""choose"" the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time. Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic ""hop"". The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.

Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used and as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various and other as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth's early atmosphere was highly at . Fossils of what are thought to be photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago. The main source of in the derives from , and its appearance is sometimes referred to as the . Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in , became important during the era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is to molecular oxygen in the . Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts Plant cells with visible chloroplasts (from a moss, ) Several groups of animals have formed relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in , and . It is presumed that this is due to the particularly simple and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes. In addition, a few marine and also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see ). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. Some of the genes from the plant have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins that they need to survive. An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular , prokaryotic-type , and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center. The suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by ) by early cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like , chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in . DNA in chloroplasts codes for proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.

Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the ""red lineages"" and the ""green lineages"". The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A , remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga). Some dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae. While able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are and practice to various degrees. Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a of extant (formerly called blue-green algae), which are the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis. The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth's history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier. Because the Earth's atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen. Available evidence from geobiological studies of (>2500 Ma) indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal of oxygen throughout the (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of .[] joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on near the end of the , but only with the (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to as in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the of marine algae. Experimental history Discovery Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century. Portrait of by , c. 1674 began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the of the soil used by a plant and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant's comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself. , a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly air. He then showed that the air that had been ""injured"" by the candle and the mouse could be restored by a plant. In 1779, repeated Priestley's experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours. In 1796, , a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which photosynthesis is used to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined. Refinements made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction, in which hydrogen (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide. discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll ""a"", PSII contains primarily chlorophyll ""a"" with most of the available chlorophyll ""b"", among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry. thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like , or after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction: 2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH2 + O2 A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. and used to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water. works in his photosynthesis laboratory. and , along with , elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the , but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle. –winning scientist was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain. and discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration. In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of in vivo was presented by using intact cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent formation. In 1954, et al. discovered photophosphorylation in vitro in isolated with the help of P32. and discovered that chlorophyll ""a"" will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll ""a"" (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series. Development of the concept In 1893, proposed two terms, photosyntax and photosynthesis, for the biological process of synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light. The term photosynthesis is derived from the phōs (, gleam) and sýnthesis (, arranging together), while another word that he designated was photosyntax, from sýntaxis (, configuration). Over time, the term photosynthesis came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term. C3 : C4 photosynthesis research In the late 1940s at the , the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists , Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques. The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae Chlorella in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight. Later in 1958–1963 at , field grown was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be saturated at near full sunlight. This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of and uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species. In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane. Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light. The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986. These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate. Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants. Factors The is the primary site of photosynthesis in plants. There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis[] and several corollary factors. The four main are: Light and Water absorption . Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis. Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature See also: spectra of free chlorophyll a (blue) and b (red) in a solvent. The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment–protein interactions. The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life. The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space. In the early 20th century, and investigated the effects of light intensity () and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance. At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased. These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, reactions are not affected by . However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent 'photochemical' temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman's experiments illustrate the concept of . Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called . This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center. Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration Photorespiration As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. , the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called , uses energy, but does not produce sugars. RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons: One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the . Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis. Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce (NH3), which is able to out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen. A highly simplified summary is: 2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3 The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

Herbivores then obtain this energy by eating plants, and carnivores obtain it by eating herbivores.The processDuring photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the air and soil. Within the plant cell, the water is oxidized, meaning it loses electrons, while the carbon dioxide is reduced, meaning it gains electrons. This transforms the water into oxygen and the carbon dioxide into glucose. The plant then releases the oxygen back into the air, and stores energy within the glucose molecules.ChlorophyllInside the plant cell are small organelles called chloroplasts, which store the energy of sunlight. Within the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplast is a light-absorbing pigment called chlorophyll, which is responsible for giving the plant its green color. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll absorbs energy from blue- and red-light waves, and reflects green-light waves, making the plant appear green.Light-dependent reactions vs. light-independent reactionsWhile there are many steps behind the process of photosynthesis, it can be broken down into two major stages: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reaction takes place within the thylakoid membrane and requires a steady stream of sunlight, hence the name light-dependent reaction. The chlorophyll absorbs energy from the light waves, which is converted into chemical energy in the form of the molecules ATP and NADPH. The light-independent stage, also known as the Calvin Cycle, takes place in the stroma, the space between the thylakoid membranes and the chloroplast membranes, and does not require light, hence the name light-independent reaction. During this stage, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules is used to assemble carbohydrate molecules, like glucose, from carbon dioxide.C3 and C4 photosynthesisNot all forms of photosynthesis are created equal, however. There are different types of photosynthesis, including C3 photosynthesis and C4 photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is used by the majority of plants. It involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become glucose. C4 photosynthesis, on the other hand, produces a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle. A benefit of C4 photosynthesis is that by producing higher levels of carbon, it allows plants to thrive in environments without much light or water.ATPnoun(adenosine triphosphate) chemical found in most living cells and used for energy.C3 photosynthesisnounUsed by the majority of plants, it involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become a sugar called glucose.C4 photosynthesisnounInvolves producing a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle in plants that do not get a lot of light or water.Calvin cyclenounseries of reactions that take place during photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water from the atmosphere are converted into sugar.carbonnounchemical element with the symbol C, which forms the basis of all known life.carnivorenounorganism that eats meat.chlorophyllnounplants' green pigment that is essential to photosynthesis.chloroplastnounpart of the cell in plants and other autotrophs that carries out the process of photosynthesis.glucosenoun""simple sugar"" chemical produced by many plants during photosynthesis.herbivorenounorganism that eats mainly plants and other producers.NADPHnoun(nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) chemical found in most living cells and used for energy.organellenounspecialized part of a cell that performs a specific function.oxygennounchemical element with the symbol O, whose gas form is 21% of the Earth's atmosphere.photosynthesisnounprocess by which plants turn water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide into water, oxygen, and simple sugars.stromanounIn a plant cell, the protein-containing matrix between the thylakoid membranes and the chloroplast membrane.thylakoid membranenounPart of the chloroplast where light-dependent reactions take place.CreditsMedia CreditsThe audio, illustrations, photos, and videos are credited beneath the media asset, except for promotional images, which generally link to another page that contains the media credit.

This process, called photosynthesis, is essential to the global carbon cycle and organisms that conduct photosynthesis represent the lowest level in most food chains (Figure 1).

Most living things depend on photosynthetic cells to manufacture the complex organic molecules they require as a source of energy. Photosynthetic cells are quite diverse and include cells found in green plants, phytoplankton, and cyanobacteria. During the process of photosynthesis, cells use carbon dioxide and energy from the Sun to make sugar molecules and oxygen. These sugar molecules are the basis for more complex molecules made by the photosynthetic cell, such as glucose. Then, via respiration processes, cells use oxygen and glucose to synthesize energy-rich carrier molecules, such as ATP, and carbon dioxide is produced as a waste product. Therefore, the synthesis of glucose and its breakdown by cells are opposing processes. The building and breaking of carbon-based material — from carbon dioxide to complex organic molecules (photosynthesis) then back to carbon dioxide (respiration) — is part of what is commonly called the global carbon cycle. Indeed, the fossil fuels we use to power our world today are the ancient remains of once-living organisms, and they provide a dramatic example of this cycle at work. The carbon cycle would not be possible without photosynthesis, because this process accounts for the ""building"" portion of the cycle (Figure 2). However, photosynthesis doesn't just drive the carbon cycle — it also creates the oxygen necessary for respiring organisms. Interestingly, although green plants contribute much of the oxygen in the air we breathe, phytoplankton and cyanobacteria in the world's oceans are thought to produce between one-third and one-half of atmospheric oxygen on Earth. What Cells and Organelles Are Involved in Photosynthesis? Figure 3: Structure of a chloroplast© 2010 All rights reserved. Photosynthetic cells contain special pigments that absorb light energy. Different pigments respond to different wavelengths of visible light. Chlorophyll, the primary pigment used in photosynthesis, reflects green light and absorbs red and blue light most strongly. In plants, photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which contain the chlorophyll. Chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane and contain a third inner membrane, called the thylakoid membrane, that forms long folds within the organelle. In electron micrographs, thylakoid membranes look like stacks of coins, although the compartments they form are connected like a maze of chambers. The green pigment chlorophyll is located within the thylakoid membrane, and the space between the thylakoid and the chloroplast membranes is called the stroma (Figure 3, Figure 4). Chlorophyll A is the major pigment used in photosynthesis, but there are several types of chlorophyll and numerous other pigments that respond to light, including red, brown, and blue pigments. These other pigments may help channel light energy to chlorophyll A or protect the cell from photo-damage. For example, the photosynthetic protists called dinoflagellates, which are responsible for the ""red tides"" that often prompt warnings against eating shellfish, contain a variety of light-sensitive pigments, including both chlorophyll and the red pigments responsible for their dramatic coloration. Figure 4: Diagram of a chloroplast inside a cell, showing thylakoid stacksShown here is a chloroplast inside a cell, with the outer membrane (OE) and inner membrane (IE) labeled. Other features of the cell include the nucleus (N), mitochondrion (M), and plasma membrane (PM). At right and below are microscopic images of thylakoid stacks called grana. Note the relationship between the granal and stromal membranes.© 2004 Nature Publishing Group Soll, J. & Schleiff, E. Protein import into chloroplasts. Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 5, 198-208 (2004) doi:10.1038/nrm1333. All rights reserved. What Are the Steps of Photosynthesis? Photosynthesis consists of both light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions. In plants, the so-called ""light"" reactions occur within the chloroplast thylakoids, where the aforementioned chlorophyll pigments reside. When light energy reaches the pigment molecules, it energizes the electrons within them, and these electrons are shunted to an electron transport chain in the thylakoid membrane. Every step in the electron transport chain then brings each electron to a lower energy state and harnesses its energy by producing ATP and NADPH. Meanwhile, each chlorophyll molecule replaces its lost electron with an electron from water; this process essentially splits water molecules to produce oxygen (Figure 5). Figure 5: The light and dark reactions in the chloroplastThe chloroplast is involved in both stages of photosynthesis. The light reactions take place in the thylakoid. There, water (H2O) is oxidized, and oxygen (O2) is released. The electrons that freed from the water are transferred to ATP and NADPH. The dark reactions then occur outside the thylakoid. In these reactions, the energy from ATP and NADPH is used to fix carbon dioxide (CO2). The products of this reaction are sugar molecules and various other organic molecules necessary for cell function and metabolism. Note that the dark reaction takes place in the stroma (the aqueous fluid surrounding the stacks of thylakoids) and in the cytoplasm.© 2010 All rights reserved. Once the light reactions have occurred, the light-independent or ""dark"" reactions take place in the chloroplast stroma. During this process, also known as carbon fixation, energy from the ATP and NADPH molecules generated by the light reactions drives a chemical pathway that uses the carbon in carbon dioxide (from the atmosphere) to build a three-carbon sugar called glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P). Cells then use G3P to build a wide variety of other sugars (such as glucose) and organic molecules. Many of these interconversions occur outside the chloroplast, following the transport of G3P from the stroma. The products of these reactions are then transported to other parts of the cell, including the mitochondria, where they are broken down to make more energy carrier molecules to satisfy the metabolic demands of the cell. In plants, some sugar molecules are stored as sucrose or starch. Conclusion Photosynthetic cells contain chlorophyll and other light-sensitive pigments that capture solar energy. In the presence of carbon dioxide, such cells are able to convert this solar energy into energy-rich organic molecules, such as glucose. These cells not only drive the global carbon cycle, but they also produce much of the oxygen present in atmosphere of the Earth. Essentially, nonphotosynthetic cells use the products of photosynthesis to do the opposite of photosynthesis: break down glucose and release carbon dioxide. eBooks This page appears in the following eBook Topic rooms within Cell Biology No topic rooms are there.

By storing carbon above and below the ground, the trees and plants in forests contribute to the production of oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis. How does photosynthesis work? Photosynthesis provides most of the oxygen that humans and animals breathe. Here’s how it works: Tree and plant roots absorb water, as well as minerals and nutrients, from the soil. At the same time, the leaves or needles absorb carbon dioxide from the air. These raw materials flow to plant cells containing chlorophyll. Chlorophyll uses sunlight energy to transform the carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and carbon-based compounds such as glucose, a sugar that helps plants grow. In the process, the plant or tree produces excess oxygen, which it releases into the atmosphere. Forest Fact Break: Photosynthesis This 90-second animated video explains how photosynthesis works and why our forests are such an important part of that process. It is part of OFRI’s Forest Fact Breaks series, which uses bold animated graphics, sound effects and narration to teach about natural resource topics in a fun, easy-to-understand way. Photosynthesis and carbon In addition to providing us with oxygen that we breathe, forests and photosynthesis also play a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping mitigate the harmful impacts excess carbon dioxide emissions can have on the environment.

TRANSCRIPT Photosynthesis is a biochemical process used by green plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria to capture energy from light and store it in chemical compounds that fuel biological functions. For example, land plants use water from the soil, carbon dioxide from the air, and energy from the sun to synthesize glucose, which fuels plant growth, development and physiology. The oxygen gas we breathe is released as a byproduct of this process. 9.1: What is Photosynthesis? Photosynthesis is a multipart, biochemical process that occurs in plants as well as in some bacteria. It captures carbon dioxide and solar energy to produce glucose. Glucose stores chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. The overall biochemical formula of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 + 6 O2. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere and is largely responsible for maintaining the Earth’s atmospheric oxygen content. Photosynthetic reactions occur in chloroplasts, specialized membrane-enclosed compartments in the plant cell. Chloroplasts consist of coin-like stacks of thylakoids. One such stack is called a granum. The thylakoid membranes are enriched with chlorophyll, a green pigment that gives plants and especially their leaves their green color. The chlorophyll molecule absorbs light energy in the form of photons from violet-blue, and orange and red wavelengths. The photons initiate a cascade that powers the reactions of Photosystem II and Photosystem I that produce ATP and NADPH. These two molecules are then used to power the light-independent reactions of the Calvin Cycle that take place in the stroma of the chloroplast to produce complex carbohydrates. Some plants, like corn and cacti that grow in dry, hot climates, use modified carbon-fixing processes to produce sugars, such as the C4 and CAM pathways. These climate adaptations reduce photorespiration—a process where the enzyme rubisco binds O2 and burns sugar rather than producing it by binding CO2. CAM and C4 plants separate CO2 fixation and glucose synthesis in time, or by using specialized cell compartments for both processes.

0,ssec.si,How plants make food from sunlight and air - Times of India,https://ssec.si.edu/stemvisions-blog/what-photosynthesis,"What is Photosynthesis | Smithsonian Science Education Center Search 12 Apr What is Photosynthesis By When you get hungry, you grab a snack from your fridge or pantry. But what can plants do when they get hungry? You are probably aware that plants need sunlight, water, and a home (like soil) to grow, but where do they get their food? They make it themselves! Plants are called autotrophs because they can use energy from light to synthesize, or make, their own food source. Many people believe they are “feeding” a plant when they put it in soil, water it, or place it outside in the Sun, but none of these things are considered food. Rather, plants use sunlight, water, and the gases in the air to make glucose, which is a form of sugar that plants need to survive. This process is called photosynthesis and is performed by all plants, algae, and even some microorganisms. To perform photosynthesis, plants need three things: carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. By taking in water (H2O) through the roots, carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air, and light energy from the Sun, plants can perform photosynthesis to make glucose (sugars) and oxygen (O2). CREDIT: mapichai/Shutterstock.com Just like you, plants need to take in gases in order to live. Animals take in gases through a process called respiration. During the respiration process, animals inhale all of the gases in the atmosphere, but the only gas that is retained and not immediately exhaled is oxygen. Plants, however, take in and use carbon dioxide gas for photosynthesis. Carbon dioxide enters through tiny holes in a plant’s leaves, flowers, branches, stems, and roots. Plants also require water to make their food. Depending on the environment, a plant’s access to water will vary. For example, desert plants, like a cactus, have less available water than a lilypad in a pond, but every photosynthetic organism has some sort of adaptation, or special structure, designed to collect water. For most plants, roots are responsible for absorbing water. The last requirement for photosynthesis is an important one because it provides the energy to make sugar. How does a plant take carbon dioxide and water molecules and make a food molecule? The Sun! The energy from light causes a chemical reaction that breaks down the molecules of carbon dioxide and water and reorganizes them to make the sugar (glucose) and oxygen gas. After the sugar is produced, it is then broken down by the mitochondria into energy that can be used for growth and repair. The oxygen that is produced is released from the same tiny holes through which the carbon dioxide entered. Even the oxygen that is released serves another purpose. Other organisms, such as animals, use oxygen to aid in their survival. If we were to write a formula for photosynthesis, it would look like this: 6CO2 + 6H2O + Light energy → C6H12O6 (sugar) + 6O2 The whole process of photosynthesis is a transfer of energy from the Sun to a plant. In each sugar molecule created, there is a little bit of the energy from the Sun, which the plant can either use or store for later. Imagine a pea plant. If that pea plant is forming new pods, it requires a large amount of sugar energy to grow larger. This is similar to how you eat food to grow taller and stronger. But rather than going to the store and buying groceries, the pea plant will use sunlight to obtain the energy to build sugar. When the pea pods are fully grown, the plant may no longer need as much sugar and will store it in its cells. A hungry rabbit comes along and decides to eat some of the plant, which provides the energy that allows the rabbit to hop back to its home. Where did the rabbit’s energy come from? Consider the process of photosynthesis. With the help of carbon dioxide and water, the pea pod used the energy from sunlight to construct the sugar molecules. When the rabbit ate the pea pod, it indirectly received energy from sunlight, which was stored in the sugar molecules in the plant. We can thank photosynthesis for bread! Wheat grains, like the ones pictured, are grown in huge fields. When they are harvested, they are ground into a powder that we might recognize as flour. CREDIT: Elena Schweitzer/Shutterstock.com Humans, other animals, fungi, and some microorganisms cannot make food in their own bodies like autotrophs, but they still rely on photosynthesis. Through the transfer of energy from the Sun to plants, plants build sugars that humans consume to drive our daily activities. Even when we eat things like chicken or fish, we are transferring energy from the Sun into our bodies because, at some point, one organism consumed a photosynthetic organism (e.g., the fish ate algae). So the next time you grab a snack to replenish your energy, thank the Sun for it!

From Photosynthesis is one of the most important processes in nature. From We suspected that photorespiration was stealing away a portion of photosynthesis. From Even algae move toward the light to allow for photosynthesis. From However, before we can meaningfully manipulate the proteins involved in photosynthesis, we need to understand their structure in detail. From That differs from other companies that are developing algae that relies on photosynthesis in ponds or outdoor translucent containers. From In a process called photosynthesis, light energy is used to produce biochemical energy and the oxygen we breathe. From Think of photosynthesis, where antennas gather photons in one location and transfer charge to reaction centers that are, from a molecular perspective, on another continent. From We know this is important -- experimental results tell us that coherence is a vital aspect of photosynthesis. From In plants, the pigment chlorophyll plays a central role in photosynthesis: the process of converting sunlight to energy. From This impact winter was likely a major driver of mass extinction because of the resulting global decimation of marine and continental photosynthesis. From Oxygen formation in photosynthesis occurs in a reaction sequence that is completed within one thousandth of a second. From With the emergence of this single leaf, the process of photosynthesis will support the growth and development of the seedling from here on out. From The vegetation could no longer do photosynthesis, and then it can't sustain itself. From An artificial version of photosynthesis, for example, could use sunlight to produce liquid fuels from nothing more than carbon dioxide and water.

In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. Photosynthesis is usually viewed as a two-step process. First, in the light reactions, the energy-providing molecule ATP is synthesized using light energy absorbed by chlorophyll and accessory pigments such as carotenoids and phycobilins, and water is broken apart into oxygen and a hydrogen ion, with the electron of the hydrogen transferred to another energy molecule, NADPH. The ATP and NADPH molecules power the second part of photosynthesis by the transfer of electrons. In these light-independent or dark reactions, carbon is broken away from carbon dioxide and combined with hydrogen via the Calvin cycle to create carbohydrates. Some of the carbohydrates, the sugars, can then be transported around the organism for immediate use; others, the starches, can be stored for later use. Compare chemosynthesis. See Note at transpiration.a closer lookAlmost all life on Earth depends on food made by organisms that can perform photosynthesis, such as green plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. These organisms make carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water using light energy from the Sun. They capture this energy with various pigments which absorb different wavelengths of light. The most important pigment, chlorophyll a, captures mainly blue and red light frequencies, but reflects green light. In plants, the other pigments are chlorophyll b and carotenoids. The carotenoids are usually masked by the green color of chlorophyll, but in temperate environments they can be seen as the bright reds and yellows of autumn after the chlorophyll in the leaves has broken down. The energy gathered by these pigments is passed to chlorophyll a. During the light reactions, the plant uses this energy to break water molecules into oxygen (O2), hydrogen ions, and electrons. The light reactions produce more oxygen than is needed for cellular respiration, so it is released as waste. All of the oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere today was produced as waste by photosynthetic organisms, especially cyanobacteria, which have been producing oxygen for some three billion years, since their first appearance in the Precambrian Eon. During the dark reactions, the plant uses hydrogen ions and the electrons to make carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Within the leaf of a green plant, photosynthesis takes place in chlorophyll-containing chloroplasts in the columnlike cells of the palisade layer and in the cells of the spongy parenchyma. The cells obtain carbon dioxide from air that enters the leaf through holes called stomata, which also allow excess oxygen to escape. Water from the roots is brought to the leaf by the vascular tissues called xylem, while the carbohydrates made by the leaf are distributed to the rest of the plant by the vascular tissue called phloem.The American Heritage® Science Dictionary Copyright © 2011.

Photosynthesis is a complex and intricate metabolic pathway by which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose and oxygen. All the phototrophs do photosynthesis in the chloroplast and produce chemical energy. Using CO2 and O2 at the end ATP is generated i.e., the energy molecule of the cell.What is Photosynthesis?The conversion of sunlight, carbon dioxide (CO2), and water into food (sugars) and oxygen are known as photosynthesis. This process is seen in plants, algae, and some microorganisms. The word photosynthesis is taken from the Greek words pho (light) and synthesis (merge together) which means (merging together with the aid of light). Light is the main important factor in the photosynthesis process.Photosynthesis, which occurs in plants, , and cyanobacteria, is more common, they follow very similar principles. The light energy is used to turn the water (H2O) received by plant roots into CO2 and produce carbohydrates. The CO2 is “reduced,” or gets electrons, while the water is “oxidized,” or loses electrons, during this process. Both oxygen and carbohydrates i.e., glucose and fructose are produced. By absorbing the CO2 produced by all breathing species and replenishing the atmosphere with oxygen, oxygenic photosynthesis acts as a counterweight to respiration.Photosynthesis takes place in the chloroplast. Chloroplast carries the green fluid known as present in the leaves which helps in photosynthesis.Light is captured by the chlorophyll and Co2 is come from the stomata and then photosynthesis takes place. Later on, the end product is also secreted with the help of stomata.End products carbohydrate is later sent to the roots, stem leaves, and different parts of a plant.Photosynthesis DiagramA diagram of Photosynthesis is showing below:Where Does Photosynthesis take place?Chloroplasts, a type of plastid (an organelle with a membrane) that is typically found in plant leaves and which performs photosynthesis, are organelle that contains chlorophyll. Primary plastids are the double-membraned kind found in plants and algae, whereas secondary plastids are the multi-membraned type found in plankton.Light energy must ultimately be transmitted to a pigment-protein complex so that it can be transformed into chemical energy in the form of electrons. Chlorophyll pigments in plants absorb light energy. When a chlorophyll pigment releases an electron, it can then go on to an appropriate recipient, converting the energy into chemical energy. Reaction centers are the pigments and proteins that transform light energy into chemical energy and start the process of electron transfer.Factors Affecting PhotosynthesisThere are some factors that affect the rate of photosynthesis.Temperature: The optimum temperature for the most efficient photosynthesis is 25° to 35° C.Light: The light intensity if high directly affects the rate of photosynthesis.Carbon Dioxide: Co2 directly affects the rate of photosynthesis. If the concentration of Co2 is low then the photosynthesis rate also decreased.Pollution: Pollutants settle on the upper surface of the leaf because of which gas exchange does not occur properly and it affects the rate of photosynthesis.Water: Water is an important factor and if it is below the optimum level it decreases the rate of photosynthesis. A low level of water does not let the stomata open and Co2 does not come inside.Also Read: Photosynthesis EquationDespite the fact that both types of photosynthesis are intricate, multistep processes, the entire procedure can be neatly condensed into a chemical equation.The oxygenic photosynthesis equation is: 6CO2 + 12H2O + Light Energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2OHere, light energy is used to mix 12 molecules of water (H2O) with six molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2). As a result, six molecules each of oxygen and water are formed, as well as one molecule of a carbohydrate (C6H12O6, or glucose).Similarly, a single generalized formula can be used to express all anoxygenic photosynthesis reactions:CO2 + 2H2A + Light Energy → [CH2O] + 2A + H2OThrough tiny holes on their leaves known as stomata, plants take in CO2 from the atmosphere and release it along with water and oxygen. The guardians of gas exchange between a plant’s interior and the outside world are stomata.Stomata release oxygen and allow water vapor to secrete out while they are open, allowing CO2 to enter the system. Stomata close in an effort to lessen the amount of water lost, but doing so prevents the plant from absorbing CO2 for photosynthesis. For plants that grow in hot, dry climates, this trade-off between CO2 intake and water loss presents a unique challenge.Photosynthetic PigmentsPigments are present in the leaves, and they provide the color to leaf. In plants, 4 types of photosynthetic pigments are:Chlorophyll aChlorophyll bXanthophyllsCartenoidsStructure of ChlorophyllChlorophyll is the green pigment present in the chloroplast. The green color of the leaf is due to chlorophyll. It has a significant role in the photosynthesis process. Chlorophyll absorbs the sun’s rays and helps in photosynthesis. There are different types of photosynthetic pigments are present.Process of PhotosynthesisPhotosynthesis takes place in the special cell organelles known as chloroplast at the cellular level. The green-colored pigment is stored under the organelle chloroplast i.e., responsible for the green color of the leaf. The lamina of the leaf helps in absorbing CO2 and sunlight.The process of photosynthesis is classified into two stages on the basis of light i.e., Light-dependent and Light independent reactionLight-Dependent ReactionsNormally photosynthesis occurred during the day under the presence of sun rays. This reaction takes place in the thylakoid membrane.Inside the thylakoid membrane-bound sac is present known as grana which stores the light.On the membrane, different proteins are presently known as Photosystems. Different proteins and pigments play the primary part in photosynthesis. Photosystems are of 2 typesPhotosystem-IPhotosystem-IIA pigment molecule like chlorophyll releases an electron when a photon of light strikes the reaction center.In light-dependent photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.2H2O + 2NADP+ +3 ADP + 3Pi ⇢ O2+ 2NADPH + 3ATPLight-Independent ReactionsLight Independent reaction is also known as Dark reaction or carbon-fixing reaction.In this reaction, monosaccharides are formed with the utilization of Co2 and H2oA dark reaction takes place in the stroma.Plants take the Co2 from the stomata and start the In the Calvin cycle, 6 molecules of Co2 are used to form one molecule of sugar (monosaccharides)3Co2 + 6 NADPH + 5H2O + 9ATP ⇢ G3P + 2H+ + 6NADP+ + 9ADP + 8PiTypes of PhotosynthesisThe C3, C4, and CAM pathways are the three basic categories of photosynthetic pathways. They all use the Calvin cycle to convert CO2 into sugars, but each pathway does so in a somewhat different way.C3 photosynthesis: According to the photosynthesis research project Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE), the majority of plants, including cereals (wheat and rice), cotton, potatoes, and soybeans, utilize C3 photosynthesis. The three-carbon molecule 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA), which is a byproduct of C3 photosynthesis, gives the process its name. When Rubisco fixes CO2, a three-carbon molecule called 3-PGA is created.C4 photosynthesis: C4 photosynthesis is used by plants like sugarcane and maize. A four-carbon chemical intermediate called oxaloacetate, which is transformed into malate, is used in this process. Malate is subsequently delivered into the bundle sheath where it disintegrates and releases CO2, which is then fixed by rubisco and converted into sugars in the Calvin cycle (just like C3 photosynthesis). Because they have a smart storing mechanism, C4 plants can continue to fix carbon even while their stomata are closed, which lowers their risk of photorespiration. They are also better adapted to hot, dry settings.CAM photosynthesis: Plants accustomed to extremely hot and dry settings, like cactus and pineapples, have a process called crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Stomata run the risk of leaking water to the environment when they open to suck in CO2. As a result, plants in hot, dry settings have evolved. CAM is one modification in which plants open their stomata at night (when temperatures are lower and water loss is less of a risk). Stomata allow CO2 to enter plants, where it is fixed into oxaloacetate and transformed into malate or another organic acid (like in the C4 pathway). Stomata close, lowering the likelihood of water loss, and the CO2 is then available for light-dependent processes during the day.Importance of PhotosynthesisBecause of this process oxygen level of the environment is maintained.Food is generated from solar energy which plays a significant role in the food chain.Photosynthesis provides food to other living organisms.FAQs on PhotosynthesisQ1: Define photosynthesis.Answer:Green plants create food from unprocessed materials in sunlight through the endergonic, anabolic, and oxidation-reduction process of photosynthesis.Q2: Why chlorophyll is an essential photosynthetic pigment?Answer:Chlorophyll-b and other pigments in the photosystem’s reaction centre absorb solar energy and transfer it to chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a is ultimately what starts the photosynthetic process.Q3: Which gas is released during photosynthesis?Answer:During the photosynthesis process, the end product i.e. oxygen gas is released.Q4: What are the green plants called?Answer:Green plants are known as Photoautrotrophs because of the process known as photosynthesis.Last Updated : 13 Jul, 2023Like Article Save Article Please Login to comment...Similar ReadsRelated Tutorials LikeArticle Contributed By : FollowVote for difficultyCurrent difficulty : Easy Normal Medium Hard ExpertImproved By :Article Tags :Report Issue Courses Recently Published Explore MoreImprove your Coding Skills with Practice A-143, 9th Floor, Sovereign Corporate Tower, Sector-136, Noida, Uttar Pradesh - 201305 CompanyExploreDSA RoadmapsData Science & MLUPSCSSC/ BANKINGWrite & Earn , We use cookies to ensure you have the best browsing experience on our website.

April 28, 2020 By Green plants make sugar for growth by a process called photosynthesis, which means making things with light. Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create oxygen and energy in the form of glucose. The glucose molecules created by photosynthesis act as fuel for cells and are used for cellular respiration and fermentation. Carbon dioxide + water (and light ) ———> glucose and oxygen Where does photosynthesis happen? Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplast cells which contain a substance called chlorophyll. It is chlorophyll which gives plants their green colour. Chloroplasts are one of the organelles in a plant cell. We made a to learn about organelles and plant cell structure. Sunlight is also needed to make chlorophyll. If plants are kept in the dark, they can’t make chlorophyll and will have yellow leaves! You can see this in our multicoloured . What affects the rate of photosynthesis Four factors affect the rate of photosynthesis. The faster it occurs, the more the plant grows. Light – the more light there is, the faster photosynthesis occurs. Water – lack of water slows photosynthesis down. Temperature – photosynthesis works best at around 30 degrees Celsius. Levels of carbon dioxide – photosynthesis is faster if there is more carbon dioxide in the air. Plants make the energy to grow through a process called . This uses the sugar produced by photosynthesis and oxygen. How are leaves adapted for photosynthesis? Leaves are green as they contain lots of chlorophyll which absorbs sunlight. They are thin and have a large surface area. This means they can absorb a lot of sunlight, and gases such as oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass in and out of the leaf easily. Leaves have veins – xylem and phloem, which transport water, minerals and sugars around the plant. Do only plants photosynthesise? No! Plants, algae, and some types of bacteria use photosynthesis to create energy. What is chlorophyll? Chlorophyll is a green pigment which absorbs energy from blue and red light waves and reflects green light waves, which is why plants look green! Chlorophyll is found in an organelle called a chloroplast. This is where photosynthesis occurs. Why is photosynthesis important? As well as allowing plants to make energy for growth and repair, photosynthesis has an important ecological impact. Plants incorporate the carbon from carbon dioxide into organic molecules ( carbon fixation ). This creates a source of carbon for animals who cannot create their own and also removes carbon dioxide from the air, slowing down the rate at which it builds up in the atmosphere. Photosynthesis also creates oxygen which is needed for most of the life on Earth!

Jeja/E+/Getty Images Share this: By October 28, 2020 at 6:30 am Take a deep breath. Then thank a plant. If you eat fruit, vegetables, grains or potatoes, thank a plant too. Plants and algae provide us with the oxygen we need to survive, as well as the carbohydrates we use for energy. They do it all through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process of creating sugar and oxygen from carbon dioxide, water and sunlight. It happens through a long series of chemical reactions. But it can be summarized like this: Carbon dioxide, water and light go in. Glucose, water and oxygen come out. (Glucose is a simple sugar.) Photosynthesis can be split into two processes. The “photo” part refers to reactions triggered by light. “Synthesis” — the making of the sugar — is a separate process called the Calvin cycle. Both processes happen inside a chloroplast. This is a specialized structure, or organelle, in a plant cell. The structure contains stacks of membranes called thylakoid membranes. That’s where the light reaction begins. Chloroplasts are found in plant cells. This is where photosynthesis takes place. The chlorophyll molecules that take in energy from sunlight are located in the stacks called thylakoid membranes. blueringmedia/iStock/Getty Images Plus Let the light shine in When light hits a plant’s leaves, it shines on chloroplasts and into their thylakoid membranes. Those membranes are filled with , a green pigment. This pigment absorbs light energy. Light travels as . The — distance between waves — determines energy level. Some of those wavelengths are visible to us . If a molecule, such as chlorophyll, has the right shape, it can absorb the energy from some wavelengths of light. Chlorophyll can absorb light we see as blue and red. That’s why we see plants as green. Green is the wavelength plants reflect, not the color they absorb. While light travels as a wave, it also can be a particle called a . Photons have no mass. They do, however, have a small amount of light energy. When a photon of light from the sun bounces into a leaf, its energy excites a chlorophyll molecule. That photon starts a process that splits a molecule of water. The oxygen atom that splits off from the water instantly bonds with another, creating a molecule of oxygen, or O2. The chemical reaction also produces a molecule called ATP and another molecule called NADPH. Both of these allow a cell to store energy. The ATP and NADPH also will take part in the synthesis part of photosynthesis. Notice that the light reaction makes no sugar. Instead, it supplies energy — stored in the and NADPH — that gets plugged into the Calvin cycle. This is where sugar is made. But the light reaction does produce something we use: oxygen. All the oxygen we breathe is the result of this step in photosynthesis, carried out by plants and algae (which are ) the world over. Give me some sugar The next step takes the energy from the light reaction and applies it to a process called the Calvin cycle. The cycle is named for Melvin Calvin, the man who discovered it. The Calvin cycle is sometimes also called the dark reaction because none of its steps require light. But it still happens during the day. That’s because it needs the energy produced by the light reaction that comes before it. While the light reaction takes place in the thylakoid membranes, the ATP and NADPH it produces end up in the stroma. This is the space inside the chloroplast but outside the thylakoid membranes. The Calvin cycle has four major steps: carbon fixation: Here, the plant brings in CO2 and attaches it to another carbon molecule, using rubisco. This is an , or chemical that makes reactions move faster. This step is so important that rubisco is the most common protein in a chloroplast — and on Earth. Rubisco attaches the carbon in CO2 to a five-carbon molecule called ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate (or RuBP). This creates a six-carbon molecule, which immediately splits into two chemicals, each with three carbons.reduction: The ATP and NADPH from the light reaction pop in and transform the two three-carbon molecules into two small sugar molecules. The sugar molecules are called G3P. That’s short for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GLIH- sur-AAL-duh-hide 3-FOS-fayt).carbohydrate formation: Some of that G3P leaves the cycle to be converted into bigger sugars such as glucose (C6H12O6).regeneration: With more ATP from the continuing light reaction, leftover G3P picks up two more carbons to become RuBP. This RuBP pairs up with rubisco again. They are now ready to start the Calvin cycle again when the next molecule of CO2 arrives. At the end of photosynthesis, a plant ends up with glucose (C6H12O6), oxygen (O2) and water (H2O). The glucose molecule goes on to bigger things. It can become part of a long-chain molecule, such as cellulose; that’s the chemical that makes up cell walls. Plants also can store the energy packed in a glucose molecule within larger starch molecules. They can even put the glucose into other sugars — such as fructose — to make a plant’s fruit sweet. All of these molecules are carbohydrates — chemicals containing carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. (CarbOHydrate makes it easy to remember.) The plant uses the bonds in these chemicals to store energy. But we use the these chemicals too. Carbohydrates are an important part of the foods we eat, particularly grains, potatoes, fruits and vegetables. We eat plants for food. But plants make their own food. This video explains how. Power Words algae: Single-celled organisms, once considered plants (they aren’t). As aquatic organisms, they grow in water. Like green plants, they depend on sunlight to make their food. atom: The basic unit of a chemical element. Atoms are made up of a dense nucleus that contains positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons. The nucleus is orbited by a cloud of negatively charged electrons. ATP: Short for adenosine triphosphate. Cells make this molecule to power almost all of their activities. Cells use oxygen and simple sugars to create this molecule, the main source of their energy. The small structures in cells that carry out this energy-storing process are known as mitochondria. Like a battery, ATP stores a bit of usable energy. Once the cell uses it up, mitochondria must recharge the cell by making more ATP using energy harvested from the cell’s nutrients. bond: (in chemistry) A semi-permanent attachment between atoms — or groups of atoms — in a molecule. It’s formed by an attractive force between the participating atoms. Once bonded, the atoms will work as a unit. To separate the component atoms, energy must be supplied to the molecule as heat or some other type of radiation. Calvin cycle: Named for Melvin Calvin, the man who discovered it, this cycle is the process by which plants and algae turn carbon dioxide into basic carbohydrates. carbohydrates: Any of a large group of compounds occurring in foods and living tissues, including sugars, starch and cellulose. They contain hydrogen and oxygen in the same ratio as water (2:1) and typically can be broken down in an animal’s body to release energy. carbon dioxide: (or CO2) A colorless, odorless gas produced by all animals when the oxygen they inhale reacts with the carbon-rich foods that they’ve eaten. Carbon dioxide also is released when organic matter burns (including fossil fuels like oil or gas). Carbon dioxide acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat in Earth’s atmosphere. Plants convert carbon dioxide into oxygen during photosynthesis, the process they use to make their own food. cell: The smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Typically too small to see with the unaided eye, it consists of a watery fluid surrounded by a membrane or wall. Depending on their size, animals are made of anywhere from thousands to trillions of cells. Most organisms, such as yeasts, molds, bacteria and some algae, are composed of only one cell. cellulose: A type of fiber found in plant cell walls. It is formed by chains of glucose molecules. chemical: A substance formed from two or more atoms that unite (bond) in a fixed proportion and structure. For example, water is a chemical made when two hydrogen atoms bond to one oxygen atom. Its chemical formula is H2O. Chemical also can be an adjective to describe properties of materials that are the result of various reactions between different compounds. chemical reaction: A process that involves the rearrangement of the molecules or structure of a substance, as opposed to a change in physical form (as from a solid to a gas). chlorophyll: Any of several green pigments found in plants that perform photosynthesis — creating sugars (foods) from carbon dioxide and water. chloroplast: A tiny structure in the cells of green algae and green plants that contain chlorophyll and creates glucose through photosynthesis. electromagnetic: An adjective referring to light radiation, to magnetism or to both. excite: (in chemistry and physics) To transfer energy to one or more outer electrons in an atom. They remain in this higher energy state until they shed the extra energy through the emission of some type of radiation, such as light. fructose: A simple sugar. Along with glucose, fructose makes up half of each molecule of sucrose (also known as table sugar). glucose: A simple sugar that is an important energy source in living organisms. As an energy source moving through the bloodstream, it is known as “blood sugar.” It is half of the molecule that makes up table sugar (also known as sucrose). glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate or G3P: A molecule created as part of the chemical steps that form simple carbohydrates. Two molecules of G3P are made in plants and algae as part of the Calvin cycle of photosynthesis. Animals and bacteria also create G3P as part of their own steps of making carbohydrate. hydrogen: The lightest element in the universe. As a gas, it is colorless, odorless and highly flammable. It’s an integral part of many fuels, fats and chemicals that make up living tissues. It’s made of a single proton (which serves as its nucleus) orbited by a single electron. mass: A number that shows how much an object resists speeding up and slowing down — basically a measure of how much matter that object is made from. membrane: A barrier which blocks the passage (or flow through) of some materials depending on their size or other features. Membranes are an integral part of filtration systems. Many serve that same function as the outer covering of cells or organs of a body. molecule: An electrically neutral group of atoms that represents the smallest possible amount of a chemical compound. Molecules can be made of single types of atoms or of different types. For example, the oxygen in the air is made of two oxygen atoms (O2), but water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (H2O). NADPH or NADP+: Short for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (but no one calls it that). This molecule is a way for cells to store and transfer energy. When the NADP+ molecule is transformed to NADPH, it contains energy, which it can then use to power other reactions in a cell. organelle: Specialized structures, such as mitochondria, found within a cell. oxygen: A gas that makes up about 21 percent of Earth's atmosphere. All animals and many microorganisms need oxygen to fuel their growth (and metabolism). particle: A minute amount of something. photon: A particle representing the smallest possible amount of light or other type of electromagnetic radiation. photosynthesis: (verb: photosynthesize) The process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to produce foods from carbon dioxide and water. protein: A compound made from one or more long chains of amino acids. Proteins are an essential part of all living organisms. They form the basis of living cells, muscle and tissues; they also do the work inside of cells. Among the better-known, stand-alone proteins are the hemoglobin (in blood) and the antibodies (also in blood) that attempt to fight infections. Medicines frequently work by latching onto proteins. reduction: (v. reduce) A chemical reaction that adds one or more electrons. It’s also viewed as the opposite of oxidation. As rust oxidizes iron, the process reduces those nearby oxygen atoms. That means that they gain electrons, which have a negative charge. ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate: (RuBP) A molecule that completes the first and last steps of the Calvin cycle, which creates sugar out of carbon dioxide. This molecule contains five carbons and binds to the enzyme rubisco. Rubisco hooks up RuBP with carbon dioxide from the air, the first step in making a carbohydrate. rubisco: This acronym stands for ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. It is the most common protein on Earth. In its role as an enzyme, it plays a pivotal role in photosynthesis. starch: A soft white chemical made by all green plants. It’s a relatively long molecule made from linking together a lot of smaller, identical building blocks — all of them glucose, a simple sugar. Plants and animals use glucose as an energy source. Plants store that glucose, in the form of starch, as a reserve supply of energy. Animals that consume starch can break down the starch into glucose molecules to extract the useful energy. stroma: (in botany) The colorless fluid inside a chloroplast, where the Calvin cycle portion of photosynthesis takes place. (in anatomy) The supportive structure surrounding an organ. It includes the connective tissue that holds the organ in place and the blood vessels that bring the organ oxygen and sugars. synthesis: (v. synthesize) The production of a substance by the combining of simpler chemical building blocks. thylakoid membranes: An internal system of connected membranes inside a chloroplast. The membranes contain not only the green pigment chlorophyll, but also proteins. These membranes are where the light reaction portion of photosynthesis takes place, producing oxygen and energy to power the sugar-making portions of photosynthesis. wavelength: The distance between one peak and the next in a series of waves, or the distance between one trough and the next. It’s also one of the “yardsticks” used to measure radiation. Visible light — which, like all electromagnetic radiation, travels in waves — includes wavelengths between about 380 nanometers (violet) and about 740 nanometers (red). Radiation with wavelengths shorter than visible light includes gamma rays, X-rays and ultraviolet light. Longer-wavelength radiation includes infrared light, microwaves and radio waves.

Instructor Lucas Clinger Learn the photosynthesis definition and study the photosynthesis process. Explore what happens during photosynthesis and study the photosynthesis equation. Updated: 02/03/2022 Table of Contents Frequently Asked Questions What is the photosynthesis process? The photosynthesis process is a two part process. In stage one, the reactants of water, carbon dioxide and sunlight enter the granum of the chloroplast. Here, the chlorophyll absorbs light energy and converts it into energy that breaks apart the water molecules. In stage two, the process moves into the stroma, and energy is used to break apart carbon dioxide and assemble atoms into glucose, a sugar that is the plant's food. Extra oxygen molecules are released as the plant's waste gas. How does photosynthesis occur in plants? Photosynthesis occurs in plants by the pigment molecule, chlorophyll, absorbing light energy. When the light energy is absorbed, it is converted into energy the plant can use to break carbon dioxide and water down and use those materials to create food for the plant. The food created is glucose, a type of sugar. It also creates oxygen molecules that are released into the atmosphere. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use light energy from the sun to convert carbon dioxide and water into sugar. The by-product, or waste gas of this process is oxygen. The prefix photo comes from the Greek word meaning light. The word synthesis means that something is made by combining things. Thus, the word photosynthesis means ""to put together with the help of light"". Photosynthesis is only able to convert energy from light with the help of the green called that is stored in the of plant cells. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. What Is Photosynthesis?Plants have a power we humans can only dream of - making food from sunlight. Sure, we can cook some savory dishes, but we use food already made, mostly by plants. This process of assembling carbohydrates fueled by the power of sunlight is called photosynthesis. Keep in mind that the sun emits all sorts of different kinds of energy, such as heat and gamma rays, but photosynthesis specifically captures light energy. In addition, photosynthesis generates basic sugar molecules called glucose, which can be used to build more complex carbohydrates. 42K views Several things happen during photosynthesis. It is divided into two stages, but there are several parts in each stage of the photosynthesis process that led up to the plant's creation of food. The two-stage process of photosynthesis takes the reactants water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight into the chloroplasts where the chlorophyll converts the light energy from the sun into energy the plant can use. The plant uses this energy to break the bonds of the water and carbon dioxide molecules, then uses the atoms to build glucose and oxygen molecules. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. Two distinct stages take place in two different areas of a plant cell's chloroplast. The chloroplast is an organelle unique to plant cells. Animal cells do not contain chloroplasts. The chloroplasts hold a pigment molecule called chlorophyll. A pigment molecule is one that has the ability to absorb light and color. This green pigment of chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color. In the first stage of photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide enter and move into the chloroplast. Inside the chloroplast are stacks of called the . In the granum is where the photosynthetic pigment called chlorophyll absorbs sunlight. The photons from the sun's energy are used to break the bonds of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and some of the oxygen is released from the plant through small openings on the surface of its leaves or stem called stoma. Stage one is called the light dependent stage because the process cannot happen without the absorption of sunlight. In stage two, the process moves into the stroma, an open area around the granum. It is here that the ATP energy from stage one aids in breaking the bonds of carbon dioxide and builds glucose molecules. Stage two is called the light independent stage because the materials used in this stage can complete their activities without the use of light. Detailed Drawing of the Parts of A Chloroplast To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. The process of photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen. Oxygen molecules are released through the plant's stoma, small openings on the underside of the leaves or on the outside of the stem. Glucose is a form of sugar and an energy source. Glucose is a potential chemical energy molecule, meaning it stores chemical energy for later use. In order to use the energy stored in glucose, it must be broken down by the process of cellular respiration. During this process, new products are formed, and energy is released as kinetic chemical energy that the plant, or organism that has eaten the plant, can use.

The role of chlorophyll, the pigment molecule in plant cells, is to absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis. The chlorophyll is contained in plant cell organelles called chloroplasts. It is in the chloroplasts that some of the solar light energy in photosynthesis is transformed into chemical energy stored in a , the food photosynthesis creates for the plant. The task that photosynthesis accomplishes is rearranging the atoms of carbon dioxide and water molecules and assembling them into food molecules. This task can be represented with the photosynthesis equation:6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂The equation shows that carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight are the reactants of photosynthesis. The products of photosynthesis are glucose and oxygen. The equation also shows that one round of photosynthesis requires six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water to be assembled to create food molecules. The food molecule is glucose. The oxygen molecules are the waste gas of the plant.Plants are not the only organisms that undergo photosynthesis. Some protists, such as algae, and some types of bacteria make their own food through the process of photosynthesis as well. To unlock this lesson you must be a Study.com Member. The Process of PhotosynthesisThe prefix 'photo' means light, and 'synthesis' means to bring together. In other words, photosynthesis is the bringing together of molecules using light energy. Just what does the process of photosynthesis bring together to make sugar molecules? Two things: carbon dioxide and water. How this process works can be understood from two overarching perspectives: matter and energy. In terms of matter, photosynthesis takes smaller, simpler materials and assembles them into larger, more complex ones. In terms of energy, photosynthesis transforms light energy from the sun into a form living things can access: the stored chemical energy in food molecules. Technically, one round of photosynthesis requires six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water. From this, one molecule of glucose is produced along with six molecules of oxygen as a by-product. carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> oxygen and glucose, or more specifically: 6CO2 + 6H2 O + sunlight -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 The formula for photosynthesis includes water, sunlight and carbon dioxide as reactants, and glucose and oxygen as products Where Does Photosynthesis Occur?The first part of the process of photosynthesis is the light dependent reactions. As mentioned, sunlight is the energy source for this process. In terms of cellular structures, plants and other organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis must have certain specialized components. One component that photosynthetic organisms require is a pigment molecule, which is a special-colored substance that acts like an antenna capable of absorbing light energy. Pigment molecules channel the light energy into the right spot where the cell is carrying out photosynthesis. The most common pigment is chlorophyll, which is responsible for the widespread green color we all associate with plants. Plants contain their chlorophyll and pigments inside a type of organelle called a chloroplast, and it is within this structure that photosynthesis is carried out. Prokaryotic organisms that lack organelles simply carry out the food-making process in the cytoplasm, but still require pigment molecules to do so. Chloroplasts are organelles inside plant cells where photosynthesis is carried out Perhaps you have seen plants with red or yellow leaves, and not just in fall? These plants have other types of pigments in them instead of or in addition to chlorophyll. The Products of PhotosynthesisOne round of photosynthesis produces a single sugar molecule. The most common sugar made is glucose, which has the chemical formula C6 H12 O6. Like all molecules, glucose contains chemical potential energy. Living things can only access the energy needed to survive from food molecules. In other words, plants convert solar energy into a form of energy living things can be fueled by because, clearly, we cannot satisfy our hunger from taking in rays at the beach. Even plants themselves must break down the same food they make to access the energy they need, much like a farmer must eat even though s/he grows acres and acres of crops. In addition to sugar, photosynthesis releases six molecules of oxygen gas (O2). The chemical equation for photosynthesis Photosynthesis in Other OrganismsThere are other organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis aside from plants, such as certain types of bacteria and protists. To be fair to the bacteria, they are likely the ones who evolved the process in the first place. Any organism, plant or otherwise, carrying out photosynthesis would have to contain one of the pigment molecules, usually chlorophyll. Lesson SummaryPhotosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert light energy into sugar molecules. The equation for photosynthesis is: carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> oxygen and glucose 6CO2 + 6H2 O + sunlight -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 Photosynthesis starts with the light dependent reactions, which are the steps that use chlorophyll, a pigment molecule, to extract energy from light. The light dependent reactions power the next set of reactions that create the products of photosynthesis, oxygen and glucose, a single sugar molecule. Key Vocabulary Photosynthesis Photosynthesis equation Light dependent reactions Chlorophyll Chloroplasts Learning OutcomesThe process of learning these concepts about photosynthesis could prepare you to: Point out the reason plants conduct photosynthesis Understand the way in which photosynthesis works Describe the steps of photosynthesis Recognize the parts of the plant involved in photosynthesis Discuss the products of this process Note other organisms that can conduct photosynthesis Additional Info What Is Photosynthesis?Plants have a power we humans can only dream of - making food from sunlight.

From this, one molecule of glucose is produced along with six molecules of oxygen as a by-product. carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> oxygen and glucose, or more specifically: 6CO2 + 6H2 O + sunlight -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 The formula for photosynthesis includes water, sunlight and carbon dioxide as reactants, and glucose and oxygen as products Where Does Photosynthesis Occur?The first part of the process of photosynthesis is the light dependent reactions. As mentioned, sunlight is the energy source for this process. In terms of cellular structures, plants and other organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis must have certain specialized components. One component that photosynthetic organisms require is a pigment molecule, which is a special-colored substance that acts like an antenna capable of absorbing light energy. Pigment molecules channel the light energy into the right spot where the cell is carrying out photosynthesis. The most common pigment is chlorophyll, which is responsible for the widespread green color we all associate with plants. Plants contain their chlorophyll and pigments inside a type of organelle called a chloroplast, and it is within this structure that photosynthesis is carried out. Prokaryotic organisms that lack organelles simply carry out the food-making process in the cytoplasm, but still require pigment molecules to do so. Chloroplasts are organelles inside plant cells where photosynthesis is carried out Perhaps you have seen plants with red or yellow leaves, and not just in fall? These plants have other types of pigments in them instead of or in addition to chlorophyll. The Products of PhotosynthesisOne round of photosynthesis produces a single sugar molecule. The most common sugar made is glucose, which has the chemical formula C6 H12 O6. Like all molecules, glucose contains chemical potential energy. Living things can only access the energy needed to survive from food molecules. In other words, plants convert solar energy into a form of energy living things can be fueled by because, clearly, we cannot satisfy our hunger from taking in rays at the beach. Even plants themselves must break down the same food they make to access the energy they need, much like a farmer must eat even though s/he grows acres and acres of crops. In addition to sugar, photosynthesis releases six molecules of oxygen gas (O2). The chemical equation for photosynthesis Photosynthesis in Other OrganismsThere are other organisms capable of carrying out photosynthesis aside from plants, such as certain types of bacteria and protists. To be fair to the bacteria, they are likely the ones who evolved the process in the first place. Any organism, plant or otherwise, carrying out photosynthesis would have to contain one of the pigment molecules, usually chlorophyll. Lesson SummaryPhotosynthesis is the process that plants use to convert light energy into sugar molecules. The equation for photosynthesis is: carbon dioxide + water + sunlight -> oxygen and glucose 6CO2 + 6H2 O + sunlight -> C6 H12 O6 + 6O2 Photosynthesis starts with the light dependent reactions, which are the steps that use chlorophyll, a pigment molecule, to extract energy from light. The light dependent reactions power the next set of reactions that create the products of photosynthesis, oxygen and glucose, a single sugar molecule.

To get this energy, many organisms access stored energy by eating, that is, by ingesting other organisms. But where does the stored energy in food originate? All of this energy can be traced back to photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is essential to all life on earth; both plants and animals depend on it. It is the only biological process that can capture energy that originates in outer space (sunlight) and convert it into chemical compounds (carbohydrates) that every organism uses to power its metabolism. In brief, the energy of sunlight is captured and used to energize electrons, which are then stored in the covalent bonds of sugar molecules. How long lasting and stable are those covalent bonds? The energy extracted today by the burning of coal and petroleum products represents sunlight energy captured and stored by photosynthesis around 300 million years ago. Figure 1. Photoautotrophs including (a) plants, (b) algae, and (c) cyanobacteria synthesize their organic compounds via photosynthesis using sunlight as an energy source. Cyanobacteria and planktonic algae can grow over enormous areas in water, at times completely covering the surface. In a (d) deep sea vent, chemoautotrophs, such as these (e) thermophilic bacteria, capture energy from inorganic compounds to produce organic compounds. The ecosystem surrounding the vents has a diverse array of animals, such as tubeworms, crustaceans, and octopi that derive energy from the bacteria. (credit a: modification of work by Steve Hillebrand, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; credit b: modification of work by “eutrophication&hypoxia”/Flickr; credit c: modification of work by NASA; credit d: University of Washington, NOAA; credit e: modification of work by Mark Amend, West Coast and Polar Regions Undersea Research Center, UAF, NOAA) Figure 2. The energy stored in carbohydrate molecules from photosynthesis passes through the food chain. The predator that eats these deer receives a portion of the energy that originated in the photosynthetic vegetation that the deer consumed. (credit: modification of work by Steve VanRiper, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) Plants, algae, and a group of bacteria called cyanobacteria are the only organisms capable of performing photosynthesis (Figure 1). Because they use light to manufacture their own food, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, “self-feeders using light”). Other organisms, such as animals, fungi, and most other bacteria, are termed heterotrophs (“other feeders”), because they must rely on the sugars produced by photosynthetic organisms for their energy needs. A third very interesting group of bacteria synthesize sugars, not by using sunlight’s energy, but by extracting energy from inorganic chemical compounds; hence, they are referred to as chemoautotrophs. The importance of photosynthesis is not just that it can capture sunlight’s energy. A lizard sunning itself on a cold day can use the sun’s energy to warm up. Photosynthesis is vital because it evolved as a way to store the energy in solar radiation (the “photo” part) as high-energy electrons in the carbon-carbon bonds of carbohydrate molecules (the “synthesis” part). Those carbohydrates are the energy source that heterotrophs use to power the synthesis of ATP via respiration. Therefore, photosynthesis powers 99 percent of Earth’s ecosystems. When a top predator, such as a wolf, preys on a deer (Figure 2), the wolf is at the end of an energy path that went from nuclear reactions on the surface of the sun, to light, to photosynthesis, to vegetation, to deer, and finally to wolf. Learning Objectives Identify the reactants and products of photosynthesis Describe the visible and electromagnetic spectrums of light as they applies to photosynthesis Describe the light-dependent reactions that take place during photosynthesis Identify the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis Photosynthesis is a multi-step process that requires sunlight, carbon dioxide (which is low in energy), and water as substrates (Figure 3). After the process is complete, it releases oxygen and produces glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GA3P), simple carbohydrate molecules (which are high in energy) that can subsequently be converted into glucose, sucrose, or any of dozens of other sugar molecules. These sugar molecules contain energy and the energized carbon that all living things need to survive. Figure 3. Photosynthesis uses solar energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce energy-storing carbohydrates. Oxygen is generated as a waste product of photosynthesis. The following is the chemical equation for photosynthesis (Figure 4): Figure 4. The basic equation for photosynthesis is deceptively simple. In reality, the process takes place in many steps involving intermediate reactants and products. Glucose, the primary energy source in cells, is made from two three-carbon GA3Ps. Although the equation looks simple, the many steps that take place during photosynthesis are actually quite complex. Before learning the details of how photoautotrophs turn sunlight into food, it is important to become familiar with the structures involved. In plants, photosynthesis generally takes place in leaves, which consist of several layers of cells. The process of photosynthesis occurs in a middle layer called the mesophyll. The gas exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen occurs through small, regulated openings called stomata (singular: stoma), which also play roles in the regulation of gas exchange and water balance. The stomata are typically located on the underside of the leaf, which helps to minimize water loss. Each stoma is flanked by guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of the stomata by swelling or shrinking in response to osmotic changes. In all autotrophic eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place inside an organelle called a chloroplast. For plants, chloroplast-containing cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double membrane envelope (composed of an outer membrane and an inner membrane). Within the chloroplast are stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane is chlorophyll, a pigment (molecule that absorbs light) responsible for the initial interaction between light and plant material, and numerous proteins that make up the electron transport chain. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid lumen. As shown in Figure 5, a stack of thylakoids is called a granum, and the liquid-filled space surrounding the granum is called stroma or “bed” (not to be confused with stoma or “mouth,” an opening on the leaf epidermis). Practice Question Figure 5. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts, which have an outer membrane and an inner membrane. Stacks of thylakoids called grana form a third membrane layer. On a hot, dry day, plants close their stomata to conserve water. What impact will this have on photosynthesis? Show Answer Levels of carbon dioxide (a necessary photosynthetic substrate) will immediately fall. As a result, the rate of photosynthesis will be inhibited. The Two Parts of Photosynthesis Photosynthesis takes place in two sequential stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light independent-reactions. In the light-dependent reactions, energy from sunlight is absorbed by chlorophyll and that energy is converted into stored chemical energy. In the light-independent reactions, the chemical energy harvested during the light-dependent reactions drive the assembly of sugar molecules from carbon dioxide. Therefore, although the light-independent reactions do not use light as a reactant, they require the products of the light-dependent reactions to function. In addition, several enzymes of the light-independent reactions are activated by light. The light-dependent reactions utilize certain molecules to temporarily store the energy: These are referred to as energy carriers. The energy carriers that move energy from light-dependent reactions to light-independent reactions can be thought of as “full” because they are rich in energy. After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reaction to obtain more energy. Figure 6 illustrates the components inside the chloroplast where the light-dependent and light-independent reactions take place. Figure 6. Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, uses energy derived from these compounds to make GA3P from CO2. Photosynthesis at the Grocery Store Figure 7. Foods that humans consume originate from photosynthesis. (credit: Associação Brasileira de Supermercados) Major grocery stores in the United States are organized into departments, such as dairy, meats, produce, bread, cereals, and so forth. Each aisle (Figure 7) contains hundreds, if not thousands, of different products for customers to buy and consume. Although there is a large variety, each item links back to photosynthesis. Meats and dairy link because the animals were fed plant-based foods. The breads, cereals, and pastas come largely from starchy grains, which are the seeds of photosynthesis-dependent plants. What about desserts and drinks? All of these products contain sugar—sucrose is a plant product, a disaccharide, a carbohydrate molecule, which is built directly from photosynthesis. Moreover, many items are less obviously derived from plants: for instance, paper goods are generally plant products, and many plastics (abundant as products and packaging) can be derived from algae or from oil, the fossilized remains of photosynthetic organisms. Virtually every spice and flavoring in the spice aisle was produced by a plant as a leaf, root, bark, flower, fruit, or stem. Ultimately, photosynthesis connects to every meal and every food a person consumes. Spectrums of Light How can light be used to make food? When a person turns on a lamp, electrical energy becomes light energy. Like all other forms of kinetic energy, light can travel, change form, and be harnessed to do work. In the case of photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemical energy, which photoautotrophs use to build carbohydrate molecules. However, autotrophs only use a few specific components of sunlight. What Is Light Energy? The sun emits an enormous amount of electromagnetic radiation (solar energy). Humans can see only a fraction of this energy, which portion is therefore referred to as “visible light.” The manner in which solar energy travels is described as waves. Scientists can determine the amount of energy of a wave by measuring its wavelength, the distance between consecutive points of a wave. A single wave is measured from two consecutive points, such as from crest to crest or from trough to trough (Figure 8). Figure 8. The wavelength of a single wave is the distance between two consecutive points of similar position (two crests or two troughs) along the wave. Visible light constitutes only one of many types of electromagnetic radiation emitted from the sun and other stars. Scientists differentiate the various types of radiant energy from the sun within the electromagnetic spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible frequencies of radiation (Figure 9). The difference between wavelengths relates to the amount of energy carried by them. Figure 9. The sun emits energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. This radiation exists at different wavelengths, each of which has its own characteristic energy. All electromagnetic radiation, including visible light, is characterized by its wavelength. Each type of electromagnetic radiation travels at a particular wavelength. The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched out it appears in the diagram), the less energy is carried. Short, tight waves carry the most energy. This may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving a heavy rope. It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves. To make a rope move in short, tight waves, a person would need to apply significantly more energy. The electromagnetic spectrum (Figure 9) shows several types of electromagnetic radiation originating from the sun, including X-rays and ultraviolet (UV) rays. The higher-energy waves can penetrate tissues and damage cells and DNA, explaining why both X-rays and UV rays can be harmful to living organisms. Absorption of Light Light energy initiates the process of photosynthesis when pigments absorb the light. Organic pigments, whether in the human retina or the chloroplast thylakoid, have a narrow range of energy levels that they can absorb. Energy levels lower than those represented by red light are insufficient to raise an orbital electron to a populatable, excited (quantum) state. Energy levels higher than those in blue light will physically tear the molecules apart, called bleaching. So retinal pigments can only “see” (absorb) 700 nm to 400 nm light, which is therefore called visible light. For the same reasons, plants pigment molecules absorb only light in the wavelength range of 700 nm to 400 nm; plant physiologists refer to this range for plants as photosynthetically active radiation. The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal the colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum shows the rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths, and therefore higher energy. At the other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy (Figure 10). Figure 10. The colors of visible light do not carry the same amount of energy. Violet has the shortest wavelength and therefore carries the most energy, whereas red has the longest wavelength and carries the least amount of energy. (credit: modification of work by NASA) Understanding Pigments Different kinds of pigments exist, and each has evolved to absorb only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect or transmit the wavelengths they cannot absorb, making them appear in the corresponding color. Chlorophylls and carotenoids are the two major classes of photosynthetic pigments found in plants and algae; each class has multiple types of pigment molecules. There are five major chlorophylls: a, b, c and d and a related molecule found in prokaryotes called bacteriochlorophyll. Chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b are found in higher plant chloroplasts and will be the focus of the following discussion. With dozens of different forms, carotenoids are a much larger group of pigments. The carotenoids found in fruit—such as the red of tomato (lycopene), the yellow of corn seeds (zeaxanthin), or the orange of an orange peel (β-carotene)—are used as advertisements to attract seed dispersers. In photosynthesis, carotenoids function as photosynthetic pigments that are very efficient molecules for the disposal of excess energy. When a leaf is exposed to full sun, the light-dependent reactions are required to process an enormous amount of energy; if that energy is not handled properly, it can do significant damage. Therefore, many carotenoids reside in the thylakoid membrane, absorb excess energy, and safely dissipate that energy as heat. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is the absorption spectrum. The graph in Figure 11 shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and a type of carotenoid pigment called β-carotene (which absorbs blue and green light). Notice how each pigment has a distinct set of peaks and troughs, revealing a highly specific pattern of absorption. Chlorophyll a absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not green. Because green is reflected or transmitted, chlorophyll appears green. Carotenoids absorb in the short-wavelength blue region, and reflect the longer yellow, red, and orange wavelengths. Figure 11. (a) Chlorophyll a, (b) chlorophyll b, and (c) β-carotene are hydrophobic organic pigments found in the thylakoid membrane. Chlorophyll a and b, which are identical except for the part indicated in the red box, are responsible for the green color of leaves. β-carotene is responsible for the orange color in carrots. Each pigment has (d) a unique absorbance spectrum. Figure 12. Plants that commonly grow in the shade have adapted to low levels of light by changing the relative concentrations of their chlorophyll pigments. (credit: Jason Hollinger) Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; using them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity and quality decrease and change with depth. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees absorb most of the sunlight and scatter the remaining solar radiation (Figure 12). When studying a photosynthetic organism, scientists can determine the types of pigments present by generating absorption spectra. An instrument called a spectrophotometer can differentiate which wavelengths of light a substance can absorb. Spectrophotometers measure transmitted light and compute from it the absorption. By extracting pigments from leaves and placing these samples into a spectrophotometer, scientists can identify which wavelengths of light an organism can absorb. Additional methods for the identification of plant pigments include various types of chromatography that separate the pigments by their relative affinities to solid and mobile phases. Light-Dependent Reactions The overall function of light-dependent reactions is to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of NADPH and ATP. This chemical energy supports the light-independent reactions and fuels the assembly of sugar molecules. The light-dependent reactions are depicted in Figure 13. Protein complexes and pigment molecules work together to produce NADPH and ATP. Figure 13. A photosystem consists of a light-harvesting complex and a reaction center. Pigments in the light-harvesting complex pass light energy to two special chlorophyll a molecules in the reaction center. The light excites an electron from the chlorophyll a pair, which passes to the primary electron acceptor. The excited electron must then be replaced. In (a) photosystem II, the electron comes from the splitting of water, which releases oxygen as a waste product. In (b) photosystem I, the electron comes from the chloroplast electron transport chain discussed below. The actual step that converts light energy into chemical energy takes place in a multiprotein complex called a photosystem, two types of which are found embedded in the thylakoid membrane, photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI) (Figure 14). The two complexes differ on the basis of what they oxidize (that is, the source of the low-energy electron supply) and what they reduce (the place to which they deliver their energized electrons). Both photosystems have the same basic structure; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place. Each photosystem is serviced by the light-harvesting complex, which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids. The absorption of a single photon or distinct quantity or “packet” of light by any of the chlorophylls pushes that molecule into an excited state. In short, the light energy has now been captured by biological molecules but is not stored in any useful form yet. The energy is transferred from chlorophyll to chlorophyll until eventually (after about a millionth of a second), it is delivered to the reaction center. Up to this point, only energy has been transferred between molecules, not electrons. Practice Question Figure 14. The photosystem II (PSII) reaction center and the photosystem I (PSI). In the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, energy from sunlight is used to extract electrons from water. The electrons travel through the chloroplast electron transport chain to photosystem I (PSI), which reduces NADP+ to NADPH. The electron transport chain moves protons across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. At the same time, splitting of water adds protons to the lumen, and reduction of NADPH removes protons from the stroma. The net result is a low pH in the thylakoid lumen, and a high pH in the stroma. ATP synthase uses this electrochemical gradient to make ATP. What is the initial source of electrons for the chloroplast electron transport chain? water oxygen carbon dioxide NADPH Show Answer Water is the initial source. The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property. Those two chlorophylls can undergo oxidation upon excitation; they can actually give up an electron in a process called a photoact. It is at this step in the reaction center, that light energy is converted into an excited electron. All of the subsequent steps involve getting that electron onto the energy carrier NADPH for delivery to the Calvin cycle where the electron is deposited onto carbon for long-term storage in the form of a carbohydrate. PSII and PSI are two major components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, which also includes the cytochrome complex. The cytochrome complex, an enzyme composed of two protein complexes, transfers the electrons from the carrier molecule plastoquinone (Pq) to the protein plastocyanin (Pc), thus enabling both the transfer of protons across the thylakoid membrane and the transfer of electrons from PSII to PSI. The reaction center of PSII (called P680) delivers its high-energy electrons, one at the time, to the primary electron acceptor, and through the electron transport chain (Pq to cytochrome complex to plastocyanine) to PSI. P680’s missing electron is replaced by extracting a low-energy electron from water; thus, water is split and PSII is re-reduced after every photoact. Splitting one H2O molecule releases two electrons, two hydrogen atoms, and one atom of oxygen. Splitting two molecules is required to form one molecule of diatomic O2 gas. About 10 percent of the oxygen is used by mitochondria in the leaf to support oxidative phosphorylation. The remainder escapes to the atmosphere where it is used by aerobic organisms to support respiration. As electrons move through the proteins that reside between PSII and PSI, they lose energy. That energy is used to move hydrogen atoms from the stromal side of the membrane to the thylakoid lumen. Those hydrogen atoms, plus the ones produced by splitting water, accumulate in the thylakoid lumen and will be used synthesize ATP in a later step. Because the electrons have lost energy prior to their arrival at PSI, they must be re-energized by PSI, hence, another photon is absorbed by the PSI antenna. That energy is relayed to the PSI reaction center (called P700). P700 is oxidized and sends a high-energy electron to NADP+ to form NADPH. Thus, PSII captures the energy to create proton gradients to make ATP, and PSI captures the energy to reduce NADP+ into NADPH. The two photosystems work in concert, in part, to guarantee that the production of NADPH will roughly equal the production of ATP. Other mechanisms exist to fine tune that ratio to exactly match the chloroplast’s constantly changing energy needs. Generating an Energy Carrier: ATP As in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during cellular respiration, the buildup of hydrogen ions inside the thylakoid lumen creates a concentration gradient. The passive diffusion of hydrogen ions from high concentration (in the thylakoid lumen) to low concentration (in the stroma) is harnessed to create ATP, just as in the electron transport chain of cellular respiration. The ions build up energy because of diffusion and because they all have the same electrical charge, repelling each other. To release this energy, hydrogen ions will rush through any opening, similar to water jetting through a hole in a dam. In the thylakoid, that opening is a passage through a specialized protein channel called the ATP synthase. The energy released by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate group to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP (Figure 14). The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis because the ions move from an area of high to an area of low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.

Light-Independent Reactions After the energy from the sun is converted into chemical energy and temporarily stored in ATP and NADPH molecules, the cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term energy storage. The products of the light-dependent reactions, ATP and NADPH, have lifespans in the range of millionths of seconds, whereas the products of the light-independent reactions (carbohydrates and other forms of reduced carbon) can survive for hundreds of millions of years. The carbohydrate molecules made will have a backbone of carbon atoms. Where does the carbon come from? It comes from carbon dioxide, the gas that is a waste product of respiration in microbes, fungi, plants, and animals. In plants, carbon dioxide (CO2) enters the leaves through stomata, where it diffuses over short distances through intercellular spaces until it reaches the mesophyll cells. Once in the mesophyll cells, CO2 diffuses into the stroma of the chloroplast—the site of light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These reactions actually have several names associated with them. Another term, the Calvin cycle, is named for the man who discovered it, and because these reactions function as a cycle. Others call it the Calvin-Benson cycle to include the name of another scientist involved in its discovery. The most outdated name is dark reactions, because light is not directly required (Figure 15). However, the term dark reaction can be misleading because it implies incorrectly that the reaction only occurs at night or is independent of light, which is why most scientists and instructors no longer use it. Figure 15. Light reactions harness energy from the sun to produce chemical bonds, ATP, and NADPH. These energy-carrying molecules are made in the stroma where carbon fixation takes place. The light-independent reactions of the Calvin cycle can be organized into three basic stages: fixation, reduction, and regeneration. Stage 1: Fixation In the stroma, in addition to CO2, two other components are present to initiate the light-independent reactions: an enzyme called ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO), and three molecules of ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP), as shown in Figure 16. RuBP has five atoms of carbon, flanked by two phosphates. Practice Question Figure 16. The Calvin cycle has three stages. In stage 1, the enzyme RuBisCO incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule, 3-PGA. In stage 2, the organic molecule is reduced using electrons supplied by NADPH. In stage 3, RuBP, the molecule that starts the cycle, is regenerated so that the cycle can continue. Only one carbon dioxide molecule is incorporated at a time, so the cycle must be completed three times to produce a single three-carbon GA3P molecule, and six times to produce a six-carbon glucose molecule. Which of the following statements is true? In photosynthesis, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. GA3P and water are products. In photosynthesis, chlorophyll, water, and carbon dioxide are reactants. GA3P and oxygen are products. In photosynthesis, water, carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are reactants. RuBP and oxygen are products. In photosynthesis, water and carbon dioxide are reactants. GA3P and oxygen are products. Show Answer Answer d is true. RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO2 and RuBP. For each CO2 molecule that reacts with one RuBP, two molecules of another compound (3-PGA) form. PGA has three carbons and one phosphate. Each turn of the cycle involves only one RuBP and one carbon dioxide and forms two molecules of 3-PGA. The number of carbon atoms remains the same, as the atoms move to form new bonds during the reactions (3 atoms from 3CO2 + 15 atoms from 3RuBP = 18 atoms in 3 atoms of 3-PGA). This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is “fixed” from an inorganic form into organic molecules. Stage 2: Reduction ATP and NADPH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PGA into six molecules of a chemical called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). That is a reduction reaction because it involves the gain of electrons by 3-PGA. Recall that a reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. Six molecules of both ATP and NADPH are used. For ATP, energy is released with the loss of the terminal phosphate atom, converting it into ADP; for NADPH, both energy and a hydrogen atom are lost, converting it into NADP+. Both of these molecules return to the nearby light-dependent reactions to be reused and reenergized. Stage 3: Regeneration Interestingly, at this point, only one of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle and is sent to the cytoplasm to contribute to the formation of other compounds needed by the plant. Because the G3P exported from the chloroplast has three carbon atoms, it takes three “turns” of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P. But each turn makes two G3Ps, thus three turns make six G3Ps. One is exported while the remaining five G3P molecules remain in the cycle and are used to regenerate RuBP, which enables the system to prepare for more CO2 to be fixed. Three more molecules of ATP are used in these regeneration reactions. Click stage 1, stage 2, and then stage 3 to see G3P and ATP regenerate to form RuBP. Evolution of Photosynthesis Figure 17. The harsh conditions of the desert have led plants like these cacti to evolve variations of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. These variations increase the efficiency of water usage, helping to conserve water and energy. (credit: Piotr Wojtkowski) During the evolution of photosynthesis, a major shift occurred from the bacterial type of photosynthesis that involves only one photosystem and is typically anoxygenic (does not generate oxygen) into modern oxygenic (does generate oxygen) photosynthesis, employing two photosystems. This modern oxygenic photosynthesis is used by many organisms—from giant tropical leaves in the rainforest to tiny cyanobacterial cells—and the process and components of this photosynthesis remain largely the same. Photosystems absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy into the chemical energy of ATP and NADH. The subsequent light-independent reactions then assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy. Photosynthesis in desert plants has evolved adaptations that conserve water. In the harsh dry heat, every drop of water must be used to survive. Because stomata must open to allow for the uptake of CO2, water escapes from the leaf during active photosynthesis. Desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. A more efficient use of CO2 allows plants to adapt to living with less water. Some plants such as cacti (Figure 17) can prepare materials for photosynthesis during the night by a temporary carbon fixation/storage process, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures. In addition, cacti have evolved the ability to carry out low levels of photosynthesis without opening stomata at all, a mechanism to face extremely dry periods. Now that we’ve learned about the different pieces of photosynthesis, let’s put it all together. This video walks you through the process of photosynthesis as a whole: In Summary: An Overview of Photosynthesis The process of photosynthesis transformed life on Earth. By harnessing energy from the sun, photosynthesis evolved to allow living things access to enormous amounts of energy. Because of photosynthesis, living things gained access to sufficient energy that allowed them to build new structures and achieve the biodiversity evident today. Only certain organisms, called photoautotrophs, can perform photosynthesis; they require the presence of chlorophyll, a specialized pigment that absorbs certain portions of the visible spectrum and can capture energy from sunlight. Photosynthesis uses carbon dioxide and water to assemble carbohydrate molecules and release oxygen as a waste product into the atmosphere. Eukaryotic autotrophs, such as plants and algae, have organelles called chloroplasts in which photosynthesis takes place, and starch accumulates. In prokaryotes, such as cyanobacteria, the process is less localized and occurs within folded membranes, extensions of the plasma membrane, and in the cytoplasm. The pigments of the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions, absorb energy from sunlight. A photon strikes the antenna pigments of photosystem II to initiate photosynthesis. The energy travels to the reaction center that contains chlorophyll a to the electron transport chain, which pumps hydrogen ions into the thylakoid interior. This action builds up a high concentration of ions. The ions flow through ATP synthase via chemiosmosis to form molecules of ATP, which are used for the formation of sugar molecules in the second stage of photosynthesis. Photosystem I absorbs a second photon, which results in the formation of an NADPH molecule, another energy and reducing power carrier for the light-independent reactions.

Furthermore, most anaerobic respiration processes do not use sugars as a source of energy but rather other compounds, and so have no link to photosynthesis.1 commentComment on Alan's post “You've made an excellent ...”(9 votes)Upvote Button opens signup modalDownvote Button opens signup modalFlag Button opens signup modalmoreShow more...morewhat are photosystems I and II is it the same as light reaction and dark reactionAnswerButton navigates to signup page•CommentButton navigates to signup page(4 votes)Upvote Button opens signup modalDownvote Button opens signup modalFlag Button opens signup modalmoreAnswerShow previewShow formatting optionsPost answermoreyes the 1 and 2 are the same the first one is light reaction which is an independent light, it takes photons and takes water and spits out oxygen and also spits out NADPH and ATP and these are used in dark reaction. the dark reaction they dont need photons like the light reaction needs but they need the byproducts from the light reaction to occur.

Frankly, if this process didn't occur, we probably wouldn't have life on Earth, and I wouldn't be making this video for you, because there'd be no place for me to actually get food. And the process is called photosynthesis. And you're probably reasonably familiar with the idea. The whole idea is plants, and actually bacteria and algae and other things, but we normally associate it with plants. Let me make it in very simple terms. So we normally associate it with plants. And it's a process that plants use, and we might have learned this when we were very young. It's the process that plants use to take carbon dioxide plus some water plus some sunlight and turn it into some sugars or some maybe carbohydrates. Carbohydrates or sugars plus oxygen. Obviously, this has two very profound pieces to it for us as a living species. One, we need carbohydrates or we need sugars in order to fuel our bodies. You saw that in the cellular respiration videos. We generate all of our ATP by performing cellular respiration on glucose, which is essentially a byproduct, or a broken down carbohydrate. It's the simplest one for us to process in cellular respiration. And the second hugely important part is getting the oxygen. Once again, we need to breathe oxygen in order for us to break down glucose, in order to respire, in order to perform cellar respiration. So these two things are key for life, especially for life that breathes oxygen. So this process, other than the fact that it's interesting, that there are organisms around us, mostly plants, that are able to harness actual sunlight. You have these fusion reactions in the sun 93 million miles away, and it's releasing these photons, and some small subset of those photons reach the surface of Earth. They make their way through clouds and whatever else. And then these plants and bacteria and algae are able to harness that somehow and turn them into sugars that we can then eat or maybe the cow eats them and we eat the cow if we're not vegetarians, and we can then use that for energy. Not that the cow is all carbohydrates, but this is essentially what is used as the fuel or the energy for all of the other important compounds that we eat. This is where we get all of our fuel. So this is fuel for animals. Or you know, if you eat a potato directly, you are directly getting your carbohydrates. But anyway, this is a very simple notion of photosynthesis, but it's not incorrect. I mean, if you had to know one thing about photosynthesis, this would be it. But let's delve a little bit deeper and try to get into the guts of it and see if we can understand a little bit better how this actually happens. I find it amazing that somehow photons of sunlight are used to create these sugar molecules or these carbohydrates. So let's delve a little bit deeper. So we can write the general equation for photosynthesis. Well, I've almost written it here. But I'll write it a little bit more scientifically specific. You start off with some carbon dioxide. You add to that some water, and you add to that-- instead of sunlight, I'm going to say photons because these are what really do excite the electrons in the chlorophyll that go down, and you'll see this process probably in this video, and we'll go in more detail in the next few videos. But that excited electron goes to a high energy state, and as it goes to a lower energy state, we're able to harness that energy to produce ATPs, and you'll see NADPHs, and those are used to produce carbohydrates. But we'll see that in a little bit. But the overview of photosynthesis, you start off with these constituents, And then you end up with a carbohydrate. And a carbohydrate could be glucose, doesn't have to be glucose. So the general way we can write a carbohydrates is CH2O. And we'll put an n over here, that we could have n multiples of these, and normally, n will be at least three. In the case of glucose, n is 6. You have 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens and 6 oxygens. So this is a general term for carbohydrates, but you could have many multiples of that. You could have these long-chained carbohydrates, so you end up with a carbohydrate and then you end up with some oxygen. So this right here isn't so different than what I wrote up here in my first overview of how we always imagined photosynthesis in our heads. In order to make this equation balance-- let's see, I have n carbons so I need n carbons there. Let's see, I have two n hydrogens here. Two hydrogens and I have n there, so I need two n hydrogens here. So I'll put an n out there. And lets see how many oxygens. I have two n oxygens, plus another n, so I have three n oxygens. So let's see, I have one n, and you put an n here, and then I have two n, and I think this equation balances out. So this is a 30,000-foot view of what's going on in photosynthesis. But when you dig a little deeper, you'll see that this doesn't happen directly, that this happens through a bunch of steps that eventually gets us to the carbohydrate. So in general, we can break down photosynthesis. I'll rewrite the word. We can break down photosynthesis-- and we'll delve deeper into future videos, but I want to get you the overview first-- into two stages. We can call one the light reactions. Or sometimes they are called the light-dependent reactions, and that actually would probably be a better way to write it. Let me write it like that. Light dependent means that they need light to occur. Light-dependent reactions. And then you have something called the dark reactions, and that's actually a bad name, because it also occurs in the light. Dark reactions, I wrote in a slightly darker color. And the reason why I said it's a bad name is because it still occurs in the light. But the reason why they probably called it the dark reaction is that you don't need light, or that part of photosynthesis isn't dependent on photons to occur. So a better term for it would have been light-independent reaction. So just to be clear, the light reactions actually need sunlight. They actually need photons for them to proceed. The dark reactions do not need photons for them to happen, although they do occur when the sun is out. They don't need those photons, but they need the byproducts from the light reaction to occur, so that's why it's called the light-independent reaction. They occur while the sun is out, but they don't need the sun. This needs the sun, so let me make it very clear. So this requires sunlight. This requires photons. And let me just make a very brief overview of this. This'll maybe let us start building a scaffold from which we can dig deeper. So the light reactions need photons, and then it needs water. So water goes into the light reactions and out of the other side of the light reactions. We end up with some molecular oxygen. So that's what happens in the light reactions, and I'm going to go much deeper into what actually occurs. And what the light the actions produce is ATP, which we know is the cellular or the biological currency of energy. It produces ATP and it produces NADPH. Now, when we studied cellular respiration, we saw the molecule NADH. NADPH is very similar. You just have this P there. You just have this phosphate group there, but they really perform similar mechanisms. That this agent right here, this molecule right here, is able to give away-- now let's think about what this means-- it's able to give away this hydrogen and the electron associated with this hydrogen. So if you give away an electron to someone else or someone else gains an electron, that something else is being reduced. Let me write that down. This is a good reminder. OIL RIG. Oxidation is losing an electron. Reduction is gaining an electron. Your charge is reduced when you gain an electron. It has a negative charge. So this is a reducing agent. It gets oxidized by losing the hydrogen and the electron with it. I have a whole discussion on the biological versus chemistry view of oxidation, but it's the same idea. When I lose a hydrogen, I also lose the ability to hog that hydrogen's electron. So this right here, when it reacts with other things, it's a reducing agent. It gives away this hydrogen and the electron associated with it, and so the other thing gets reduced. So this thing is a reducing agent. And what's useful about it is when this hydrogen, and especially the electron associated with that hydrogen, goes from the NADPH to, say, another molecule and goes to a lower energy state, that energy can also be used in the dark reactions. And we saw in cellular respiration the very similar molecule, NADH, that through the Kreb Cycle, or actually more importantly, that through the electron transport chain, was able to help produce ATP as it gave away its electrons and they went to lower energy states. But I don't want to confuse you too much. So the light reactions, you take in photons, you take in water, it spits out oxygen, and it spits out ATP and NADPH that can then be used in the dark reactions. And the dark reactions, for most plants we talk about, it's called the Calvin Cycle. And I'll go into a lot more detail of what actually occurs in the Calvin Cycle, but it takes in the ATP, the NADPH, and it produces-- it doesn't directly produce glucose. It produces-- oh, you probably saw this. You could call it PGAL. You could call it G3P. These all stand for-- let me write these down-- this is phosphoglyceraldehyde. My handwriting broke down. Or you could call it glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. Same exact molecule. You can almost imagine it as-- this is a very gross oversimplification-- as three carbons with a phosphate group attached to it. But this can then be used to produce other carbohydrates, including glucose. If you have two of these, you can use those two to produce glucose. So let's just take a quick overview again because this is super important. I'm going to make videos on the light reactions and the dark reactions. Those will be the next two videos I make. So photosynthesis, you start with photons. All of these occur when the sun is out, but only the light reactions actually need the photons. The light reactions take photons-- we're going to go into more detail about what actually occurs-- and it takes in water. Oxygen gets spit out. ATP and NADPH get spit out, which are then used by the dark reaction, or the Calvin Cycle, or the light-independent reaction, because these still occur in the light. They just don't need photons. So they're the light-independent reaction. And it uses that in conjunction-- and we'll talk about other molecules that are used in conjunction. Oh, and I forgot a very important constituent of the dark reaction. It needs carbon dioxide. That's where you get your carbons to keep producing these phosphoglyceraldehydes, or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. So that's super important. It takes in the carbon dioxide, the products from the light reactions, and then uses that in the Calvin Cycle to produce this very simple building block of other carbohydrates. And if you remember from glycolysis, you might remember that this PGAL molecule, or this G3P-- same thing-- this was actually the first product when we split glucose in two when we performed the glycolysis. So now we're going the other way. We're building glucose so that we can split it later for energy. So this is an overview of photosynthesis, and in the next couple of videos, I'm actually going to delve a little bit deeper and tell you about the light reactions and the dark reactions and how they actually occur.Loading..."

Leegood, in , 2013Harvesting LightLight HarvestingThe first step in photosynthesis is light absorption by pigments. Besides various types of chlorophyll, these pigments include carotenoids, and open-chain tetrapyrrole bilin pigments found in, for example, cyanobacteria. Chlorophyll is a pigment based on a tetrapyrrole ring, rather like hemoglobin, except that it contains magnesium rather than iron. The ring is linked to a long side chain. Chlorophyll absorbs blue and red light, while it transmits in the green, and hence appears green. In plants, two types of chlorophyll, a and b, increase the range of wavelengths absorbed. The light energy absorbed by chlorophyll molecules either can be lost as heat or fluorescence, or can be transferred between adjacent chlorophyll molecules by resonance transfer. Chlorophyll and carotenoids associate with proteins in light-harvesting complexes. The light-harvesting complexes have been crystallized from both bacteria and plants. A light-harvesting complex acts like an antenna, similar to a satellite dish, feeding photons into the reaction centers, which contain a dimeric form of chlorophyll, where charge separation occurs. The concept of an antenna arose from the discovery in 1932, by Emerson and Arnold, that only one CO2 molecule was produced from about 2500 chlorophyll molecules after a short flash of light.At a higher level of organization, the leaf and its cells are also adapted to harvest light efficiently. In shade, the photosynthetic apparatus is spread out in large thin leaves, to increase the area of light capture and to allow light to penetrate adequately, and there is more light-harvesting chlorophyll per antenna. Within the leaf, epidermal cells can act to focus light, elongated palisade cells act as light guides, whereas mesophyll cells reflect light, acting like a hall of mirrors and increasing the distance that photons travel, thereby increasing the chance that they will be intercepted by an antenna complex.Energy CaptureReaction centers are multisubunit protein complexes situated in the photosynthetic membrane. These complexes contain the reaction center chlorophylls as well as other components involved in electron transfer. The reaction center is the core of the photosynthetic process, converting the energy of sunlight into a usable chemical form. Reaction centers carry out light-driven electron-transfer reactions that result in charge separation across the photosynthetic membrane. Rapid electron transfer to secondary acceptors is necessary to prevent recombination of these separated charges. There are two classes of reaction centers with different terminal electron acceptors, those with Fe4S4 clusters (type 1) and those with pheophytin/quinones (type 2). In plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria, both reaction centers are present (in photosystems 1 and 2, respectively), whereas photosynthetic bacteria have only one type of reaction center (e.g., type 1 in green sulfur bacteria and type 2 in purple bacteria). In plants, photosystem 2 contains a chlorophyll dimer which, when in the excited state (P680*), is an extremely strong reducing agent. An acceptor molecule, a quinone, Q, becomes reduced, leaving the positively charged chlorophyll dimer (P680+). This is an extremely strong oxidant, so strong that it can extract electrons from water.Water OxidationWater oxidation is a unique feature of photosystem 2. Water is the electron donor for photosynthetic electron transport. Each photon absorbed by P680 enables it to extract one electron from a manganese-containing enzyme, in an oxygen-evolving complex. Once four electrons have been extracted, this complex can, in turn, oxidize water, releasing O2 to the atmosphere, as well as releasing 4H+ to the thylakoid lumen. Photosynthetic bacteria utilize other sources, such as H2S or organic compounds, as electron donors.Energy Dissipation and Reactive Oxygen SpeciesAlthough light is required for photosynthesis, too much light can be harmful. The generation of highly reactive intermediates in oxygenic photosynthesis can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species. To protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative damage, photosynthetic systems possess antioxidant systems that scavenge reactive oxygen species, as well as mechanisms that regulate photosynthesis to minimize their production. These mechanisms are particularly important in high light, when the absorption of light energy exceeds a plant's capacity for CO2 fixation (e.g., when CO2 uptake is limited by stomatal closure brought about by water stress). For example, besides acting as accessory pigments in the antenna, carotenoids also have a photoprotective role. When there is an excess of light energy, carotenoids can quench the excited triplet state of chlorophyll before it reacts with oxygen, forming destructive singlet-state oxygen. Carotenoids can also regulate energy flow in the antenna by dissipating excitation of the chlorophylls as heat (nonphotochemical chlorophyll fluorescence quenching). Energy dissipation is associated with the accumulation of the carotenoid, zeaxanthin, which is interconverted with another carotenoid, violaxanthin, in the xanthophyll cycle. Physical changes, such as chloroplast movements within cells and heliotropic leaf movements, can also reduce or enhance light absorption, and photorespiration can dissipate excess photosynthetic energy.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123786302000499Darrell Fleischman, in , 2012IIB Bacterial Reaction CentersHigher plants are not the only organisms that perform photosynthesis. Algae also do, as do many bacteria. In all of them, the energy of light is converted to chemical energy in photosynthetic reaction centers. These are membrane-bound oligomeric protein complexes which contain a chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll dimer known as a special pair. The special pair donates an electron to an acceptor molecule following absorption of a photon. The reaction centers of plants, algae and photosynthetic bacteria resemble each other surprisingly closely. It has been suggested that they have evolved from a common ancestor. We will begin by describing bacterial reaction centers. Photosynthetic bacteria are described in more detail by Jones (2009) and Hunter et al. (2008) and reaction centers are discussed by Yocum (2008a).It has been possible to isolate many of the oligomeric protein complexes involved in photosynthesis by dissolving the membranes in detergent and purifying the complexes through chromatography and other techniques. The reaction centers of purple photosynthetic bacteria are embedded in the cell membrane or in the membranes of intracytoplasmic vesicles which are often called chromatophores. Hartmut Michel, Johann Deisenhofer and Robert Huber isolated reaction centers from the green-colored (!) purple bacterium Blastochloris viridis (formerly Rhodopseudomonas viridis), devised a way to crystallize them and determined their structure by x-ray diffraction (Diesenhofer and Michel, 1989). This was the first crystallization of a membrane protein and paved the way for determination of the structures of many prokaryotic and eukaryotic membrane proteins. In addition, the reaction center structure provided important insights into the general properties to be expected of integral membrane proteins. The Blc. viridis reaction center consists of four subunits. Subunits L and M have similar but not identical amino acid sequences. Each comprises five α-helices that cross the membrane. The co-factors that participate in electron transport are bound to the L and M subunits. Their arrangement is sketched in Fig. 51.2. The primary electron donor (known as P985 because a loss of optical density at 985 nm accompanies its photo-oxidation) is indeed a dimer, in this case of bacteriochlorophyll b. The reaction center also includes two additional molecules of bacteriochlorophyll b, two of bacteriopheophytin b, one molecule each of menaquinone, ubiquinone and carotenoid, and a non-heme ferrous iron ion. Bacteriopheophytin is similar to bacteriochlorophyll, but the Mg2+ is replaced by two protons. Surprisingly, the reaction center has approximate twofold symmetry. The electrons leaving P985 move down only the L side of the reaction center. The first electron transfer, to the accessory bacteriochlorophyll b, occurs within a few picoseconds (10−12 s). The electrons move to the bacteriopheophytin b associated with subunit L, to QA (menaquinone) and, finally, to QB (ubiquinone). Upon receiving two electrons (after two photoacts), the ubiquinone binds two protons from the periplasm as it is reduced to ubihydroquinone. The ubihydroquinone dissociates into the membrane and diffuses to a cytochrome bc1 complex, where it is re-oxidized. The reaction center also includes a cytochrome subunit containing four hemes, which is located on the periplasmic surface (facing the outside of the cell) of the membrane. The hemes donate electrons to oxidized P985. There is also an H subunit, which forms a sort of cap on the cytoplasmic side of the L and M subunits and is anchored to the membrane by a single membrane-spanning helix. Its function is not known. Purple bacterial reaction centers are embedded in the cytoplasmic membrane or in the membranes of intracellular vesicles which are often termed chromatophores.FIGURE 51.2. The arrangement of the co-factors in the Blastochloris viridis reaction center. The reaction center has approximate twofold (C2) symmetry, but electrons move only along the path indicated. After QB accepts two electrons, two protons from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane are bound. P985, the photochemically active bacteriochlorophyll b dimer; Bchl, bacteriochlorophyll b; BPheo, bacteriopheophytin b; QA, menaquinone; QB, ubiquinone; Fe, ferrous iron.Photosynthetic electron transport systems are capable of transporting electrons much more rapidly than photons of sunlight arrive at the special pairs. Therefore, reaction centers are accompanied by arrays of light-harvesting antenna pigments whose purpose is to capture photons and transfer the excitation energy to the special pairs. Purple bacterial reaction centers are surrounded by a “picket fence” of transmembrane dimers to which are bound bacteriochlorophyll and carotenoid molecules. The monomers, designated α and β, comprise the LH1 (light-harvesting 1) complex (Fig. 51.3). The carotenoids absorb photons in the middle of the visible spectrum and quickly pass the excitation to the bacteriochlorophyll. The bacteriochlorophyll absorbs photons in the blue, red and near-infrared regions of the spectrum. The excitations become delocalized within the circle of bacteriochlorophylls within femtoseconds (10−15 s) and are transferred to the special air in tens of picoseconds, faster than many can be lost as heat or fluorescence. Details of these processes are discussed by Blankenship (2002).FIGURE 51.3. Light absorption and the transfer and capture of excitation energy. Protein dimers to which BChl and carotenoid molecules are bound form a ring around the reaction center. (Higher plant light harvesting pigments have a quite different structure.) Light is absorbed by any bacteriochlorophyll molecule (dark rectangles). The excitation energy is then delocalized among the bacteriochlorophyll molecules and finally captured by a special bacteriochlorophyll pair in the reaction center (RC). The figure is based on the structure of the bacterial light-harvesting complex reported by Cogdell et al. (1999).Other purple bacterial reaction centers have the same basic structure, but with variations. Most have bacteriochlorophyll α, bacteriopheophytin α and only ubiquinone. Many lack a bound cytochrome subunit. Observation of their topography by atomic force microscopy has revealed a variety of arrangements of LH1, including reaction centers multimers surrounded by continuous LH1 complexes (Sturgis and Niederman, 2008). Many have peripheral light-harvesting complexes, designated LH2, LH3, etc. Like LH1, they are composed of α and β subunits arranged in cylinders. They transfer absorbed excitations to LH1.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123877383000512GEORGE N. AGRIOS, in , 2005EFFECT OF PATHOGENS ON PHOTOSYNTHESISPhotosynthesis is the basic function of green plants: it enables them to transform light energy into chemical energy, which they can utilize in all cell activities. Photosynthesis is the ultimate source of nearly all energy used in all living cells, plant or animal, as all activities of living cells, except photosynthesis, expend the energy provided by photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water from the soil are brought together in the chloroplasts of the green parts of plants and, in the presence of light, react to form glucose with a concurrent release of oxygen:6CO2+6H2OlightchlorophyllC6H12O6+6O2In view of the fundamental position of photosynthesis in the life of plants, it is apparent that any interference by pathogens with photosynthesis results in a diseased condition in the plant. That pathogens do interfere with photosynthesis is obvious from the chlorosis they cause on many infected plants, from the necrotic lesions or large necrotic areas they produce on green plant parts, and from the reduced growth and amounts of fruits produced by many infected plants.In leaf spot, blight, and other kinds of diseases in which there is destruction of leaf tissue, e.g., in cereal rusts and fungal leaf spots (Figs. 3-1A–3-1C), bacterial leaf spots (Fig. 3-1D), viral mosaics (Fig. 3-1E) and yellowing and stunting diseases (Fig. 3-1F), or in defoliations, photosynthesis is reduced because the photosynthetic surface of the plant is lessened. Even in other diseases, however, plant pathogens reduce photosynthesis, especially in the late stages of diseases, by affecting the chloroplasts and causing their degeneration. The overall chlorophyll content of leaves in many fungal and bacterial diseases is reduced, but the photosynthetic activity of the remaining chlorophyll seems to remain unaffected. In some fungal and bacterial diseases, photosynthesis is reduced because the toxins, such as tentoxin and tabtoxin, produced by these pathogens inhibit some of the enzymes that are involved directly or indirectly in photosynthesis. In plants infected by many vascular pathogens, stomata remain partially closed, chlorophyll is reduced, and photosynthesis stops even before the plant eventually wilts. Most virus, mollicute, and nematode diseases also induce varying degrees of chlorosis and stunting. In the majority of such diseases, the photosynthesis of infected plants is reduced greatly. In advanced stages of disease, the rate of photosynthesis is no more than one-fourth the normal rate.FIGURE 3-1.

Goldschmidt-Clermont, in , 2017AbstractPhotosynthesis, the use of light energy to drive carbon fixation and the synthesis of organic compounds, is a central process in the biosphere. In eukaryotes, photosynthesis takes place in a specialized organelle, the chloroplast, which has its own genetic system. The chloroplast genome contains only a small part of the genes required for photosynthesis; the others are encoded in the nuclear genome. As a consequence, the biogenesis of the photosynthetic machinery requires the coordinate expression of the two genomes. The genetics of photosynthesis addresses, first of all, the structural genes for the apoproteins of macromolecular complexes and enzymes that are required in the process. The genetic analysis also deals with genes for the synthesis of pigments and other cofactors, for the import of polypeptides in the chloroplast and targeting within the organelle, for the assembly and repair of the complexes, for the adaptation of photosynthesis to environmental conditions, and for many other facets. The genetics of photosynthesis also reveals loci required for the maintenance of the plastid, for the expression of the plastid genome, and for the regulation of plastid development.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128096338069028Sidney K. Pierce, Nicholas E. Curtis, in , 20122.4 Four levels of symbiotic plastid longevityPhotosynthesis, where ever it occurs, from bacteria to higher plants, including algae, requires at least the continuous replacement of chlorophyll and other pigments, as well as repair and replacement of the light-harvesting proteins (see, e.g., Beisel et al., 2010). So, while photosynthesis might continue for a while in the captured plastids on their own merits, continuation for many months to a year without extraplastid support seems impossible. Thus, from a functional perspective, four levels of chloroplast retention (described by Evertsen et al., 2007, but with homage paid to Clark et al., 1990) seem appropriate—(1) nonfunctional, the plastids are rapidly digested in the phagosome; (2) photosynthesis for less than a month; (3) photosynthesis for up to 3 months; and (4) photosynthesis for a year or more (Fig. 4.2). Whether or not photosynthesis occurs by the engulfed chloroplasts in the first level is likely merely a function of the process and rate of digestion by the phagosome in the particular species of slug, rather than any sort of biochemical accommodation on the part of the slug cell. The second level suggests the presence of some sort of a biochemically modified, nondigestive phagosome, but the captured plastid gradually uses up the resources brought with it from the algal cell and is degraded by the forces of harvesting light energy, without any input from the host cell. However, the two longer term levels suggest that at least a partial integration of the symbiotic plastid into the cell biology of the host cell has occurred. The chloroplasts ultimately fail even in the longest of the associations, and at least in E. chlorotica, the host cell degrades the plastid in a vacuole that takes on morphological characteristics of an apoptotic heterolysosome (Mondy and Pierce, 2003).Figure 4.2.

Cogdell, in , 2012AbstractPhotosynthesis begins when photons are absorbed by the light-harvesting system. The light-harvesting system then transfers the absorbed energy to the reaction center (RC), where it is trapped and initiates the primary redox reactions of photosynthesis. The light-harvesting system therefore acts to increase the effective cross-sectional area of each RC for light absorption. This means that RCs can be kept supplied with sufficient numbers of photons even when the incident light intensity is rather low. The size of the antenna system and the types of pigments that are used depend on the ecological niche in which the particular photosynthetic species lives.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123749208008080Rowan F. Sage, Tammy L. Sage, in , 2013AbstractC4 photosynthesis compensates for photosynthetic limitations imposed by low atmospheric CO2. C4 plants concentrate CO2 into the bundle sheath (BS) cells where Rubisco is localized. This leads to more efficient photosynthesis in warm climates and thus facilitates domination of open landscapes of low-to-mid latitude. C4 photosynthesis also allows exotic C4 grasses to become aggressive weeds. Where humans facilitate grass establishment, invasive C4 grasses can initiate autocatalytic grass-fire cycles that destroy tropical forests. Although exotic C4 grasses are expanding, much of the Earth's native C4 diversity is being degraded due to overexploitation of their habitat for agricultural purposes.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123847195001921U.M.N. Murthy, M.L. Ghirardi, in , 2013Reduced Antenna SizePhotosynthesis and H2 production in unicellular green algae can in principle operate with a nearly 100% photon utilization efficiency, making them potentially efficient biocatalysts for the generation of H2 from sunlight and water. However, green algal cultures show poor light utilization efficiency under direct sun light and can waste up to 80% of the absorbed irradiance. The reason for this is that green algal photosynthesis normally saturates at about one-fifth of full sunlight intensity or less. This optical property of the cells would further lower the productivity of a commercial hydrogen production. Enhanced hydrogen production may be achieved by engineering the antenna size to suppress fluorescence and heat dissipation that causes a reduction on antenna efficiency.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123786302004461M. Goldschmidt-Clermont, in , 2001PhotosynthesisPhotosynthesis can be described as the process that allows some living organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy, which is used to synthesize organic compounds. Photosynthesis directly supports plants, algae, and some prokaryotes, and also indirectly sustains most of life in the biosphere (setting aside the minor contribution from chemoautotrophic bacteria) by providing organic matter, food, and oxygen.Oxygenic photosynthesis, which will be the main focus of this discussion, is found in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria: CO2 is reduced to carbohydrate, water is oxidized, and oxygen is evolved. Overall, the whole process can be summarized as:CO2+H2O+light→CH2O+O2Photosynthesis comprises two phases: in the first set of reactions, light energy is absorbed and converted into chemical energy, which is then used in the second phase to reduce CO2 to carbohydrate. The chemical energy provided by photosynthesis is also used in other processes such as nitrogen or sulfur assimilation. The first phase takes place in the photosynthetic membrane and involves a series of large complexes, each containing multiple polypeptide subunits and a variety of pigments and cofactors. They form an extraordinarily sophisticated machinery which is both efficient and robust, capable of rapid dynamic adaptation to large changes in light intensity. In the case of oxygenic photosynthesis (Figure 1), photons are captured by the light-harvesting complexes (LHCII and LHCI) and their energy is used to drive redox reactions in the photosystems (PSII and PSI) and hence the flow of electrons along the electron transfer chain, from water to NADP. The cytochrome b6f complex lies in series between PSII and PSI. Water oxidation by PSII releases H+ ions, and electron transfer through the cytochrome b6f complex is coupled to H+ transfer across the photosynthetic membrane. The resulting H+ gradient is used by the ATP synthase complex to drive the phosphorylation of ADP. Cyclic electron flow, involving PSI and the cytochrome b6f complex but not PSII, contributes to the H+ gradient and thus to ATP synthesis, but not to the net production of NADPH. In the second phase of photosynthesis, NADPH and ATP participate in a series of enzymatic reactions (known as the Calvin cycle) for the reduction of CO2 to carbohydrate. In this phase light plays a regulatory role by activating enzymes of the Calvin cycle through a pathway that involves ferredoxin and thioredoxin. The enzyme Rubisco (ribulose-bis-phosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) plays a central role in CO2 fixation: it catalyzes the carboxylation of a sugar pentose to yield two molecules of triose. However Rubisco also catalyzes a side-reaction, oxygenation of the pentose which leads to photorespiration and ultimately loss of CO2.Figure 1. Simplified scheme of photosynthetic electron transport in the thylakoid membrane. Light energy captured by the antenna complex LHCII is transferred to the reaction center of photosystem II (PSII), where it induces charge separation. PSII thus catalyzes the light-driven reduction of plastoquinone and oxidation of water, with the release of oxygen and protons (H+) in the lumen. Reduced plastoquinone (PQH2), soluble in the membrane, transfers electrons to the cytochrome b6f complex. The b6f complex oxidizes PQH2 and releases protons in the lumen; one electron is transferred to plastocyanin while the other is used in the Q-cycle and returns to the plastoquinone pool. Plastocyanin (PC), a soluble protein of the lumen, transfers the electrons to photosystem I. Light energy, captured by the antenna complex of photosystem I (LHCI), drives charge separation in photosystem (PSI) so that plastocyanin is oxidized and ferredoxin is reduced. Ferredoxin (Fd) is a soluble protein of the stroma, which is oxidized by the enzyme ferredoxin NADP reductase (FNR) to reduce NADP to NADPH. The proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, generated by photosynthetic electron transport, is used by the ATP synthase complex to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi. In cyclic electron flow, electrons are returned to the b6f complex, favoring the formation of the proton gradient instead of the production of NADPH.The thick black arrows show the path of electrons from water to NADPH. The dotted gray arrow denotes cyclic electron flow.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0122270800016803K. Sudhakar, R. Mamat, in , 2019AbstractNatural photosynthesis is considered the most vital processes that endure life on Earth. Artificial photosynthesis is a concept attracting substantial recent interest for alternative energy harvesting and storage strategies. The artificial photosynthesis derives inspiration from nature for the conversion of solar light energy into electrical power. The “artificial leaf” concept aims to capture CO2 directly and convert it into liquid solar fuels or electricity. Engineering the natural photosynthetic process to produce energy represents the major challenge in the pursuit of the creation of an artificial leaf. The various aspects that are discussed in this modules are (1) natural versus artificial photosynthesis, (2) the components of an artificial leaf, (3) the possible approaches in developing an artificial leaf, (4) recent advancements and developments in artificial leaf, (5) the challenges of artificial leaf design. Finally, an outlook is presented on the future research direction of the solar leaf technology.URL: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124095489117993Recommended publicationsInfo iconJournalReference work • 2009We use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.

Oxygen is a product of photosynthesis and is needed for respiration. All organisms respire to release energy and to stay alive. Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would come to an end, as almost every food chain depends on it either directly or indirectly. Producers such as algae, seaweed, grasses and phytoplankton all require photosynthesis to make their own food.Photosynthesis brings about a balance in the ecosystem as it decreases the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Together with other processes such as respiration and combustion, it can help to maintain levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.Without photosynthesis we wouldn’t have fossil fuels such as coal and petroleum, as these were formed from photosynthetic processes. These non-renewable sources were made by the breakdown of older plants.Plant products such as timber, rubber and oil also require photosynthesis to be made.If a plant cannot photosynthesise, it will dieto-topBack to topPlants and animals working togetherThe composition of the atmosphere has changed since the Earth was formed 4.5 billion years ago. Natural processes, such as photosynthesis, have contributed to maintaining the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, required for survival.Plants release oxygen into the atmosphere as a by-product of photosynthesis and processes such as respiration and decomposition release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These processes work symbiotically, where plants and animals depend on each other to benefit from this. Plants need the carbon dioxide released by respiration and decomposition, whereas animals need the oxygen released by plants from photosynthesis. This cycle helps maintain the balance of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere.Video - Golden jellyfishProfessor Brian Cox sees photosynthesis in action, investigating a unique type of jellyfishVideo TranscriptupdownProfessor Brian Cox: All life depends on the flow of energy, which gets passed from one life-form to another. And there is one creature that embodies more than most just how that happens. This is the Golden Jellyfish.A unique subspecies only found in this one lake, on this one island, in the tiny Micronesian republic of Palau. Golden Jellyfish have evolved to do something that very few other animals can do.' It really is incredible. As far as you can see, all the way down, till the light vanishes, there are jellyfish. And you can see they've congregated in the sun. If you go over there, to where the lake's in shade there are just none. And then in this pool of light beneath the sun, there are millions of them. Beautifully elegant things just floating around.This lake is home to over 20 million jellyfish, whose success comes down to a remarkable adaptation. Their bodies play host to thousands of other organisms. Photosynthetic algae that harvest energy directly from sunlight. And once harvested, it's passed on to the jellyfish to use.The energy flows from sun, to algae, to jellyfish.' The ones at the surface are gently turning and, the reason they do that is to give all their algae an equal dose of sunlight. 'And it's not just their anatomy that's adapted to harvest solar energy. Every morning, as the sun rises the jellyfish begin to swim towards the east.' And as the sun tracks across the sky, they move back again towards the west where they spend their night. So, the jellyfish have this beautiful, intimate, and complex relationship with the position of the sun in the sky. 'As sunlight is captured by their algae it's converted into chemical energy. Energy they use to combine simple molecules, water and carbon dioxide, to produce a far more complex one: glucose. Once absorbed by the jellyfish, glucose, and other molecules, not only power their daily voyage across the lake, they provide the basic building blocks the jellyfish use to grow the elegant and complex structures of their bodies.So, the jellyfish, through their symbiotic algae, absorb the light, the energy, from the sun, and they use it to, well to live, to power their processes of life. And that's true, directly or indirectly, for every form of life on the surface of our planet. 'The sun's energy that bathes the Earth is harnessed by photosynthesis.Once transformed, it's passed on from one lifeform to another as food. The flow of energy animates all living things.The golden jellyfish has evolved to carry algae within their bodies and feed off the glucose the plants create.The jellyfish move towards the light of the Sun throughout the day to increase photosynthesis. The symbiotic relationship between the two species allows the jellyfish to live off the glucose the algae produce.to-topBack to topUses of glucoseGlucose is a useful molecule that is made during the process of photosynthesis. The initial use for glucose, when broken down during respiration, is to release energy. Glucose is a molecule that can be bonded together to make many types of carbohydrates including cellulose and starch (in plants) and glycogen (in animals). Think of it like each glucose molecule being an individual bead on a necklace and the entire necklace represents the carbohydrate molecule.Plants only photosynthesise and synthesise glucose during the day when there is sunlight, but they use glucose for respiration all the time, including during the night.CelluloseGlucose is used to make cellulose. Cellulose is an example of a natural polymer. Cellulose is the main component found in plant cell walls and this gives the plant cell strength and support. Humans cannot digest cellulose, but it is important in your diet as fibre. Fibre assists your digestive system, keeping food moving through the gut and pushing waste out of the body.StarchOther uses of glucose produced from photosynthesis is to make the insoluble storage molecule starch. Most plants including rice, potatoes and wheat store their energy as starch. Starch is also a polymer and can be converted back to glucose by the plant when it is needed, for example at night for respiration.Fats and oilsGlucose can also be converted to fats and oils such as olive oil. Fats and oils are also used by the plant as a storage form of energy.Amino acidsGlucose produced in photosynthesis can be used to help make amino acids. These amino acids are used by the plant to synthesise proteins. Minerals such as nitrate ions are also absorbed by the roots of the plants to help make these amino acids.

This is because what distinguishes living things from nonliving things is the presence of cells, and cells are nothing but bags of chemicals with a multitude of chemical reactions occurring inside them. And furthermore, all the metabolic activities in cells are being directed by a famous bunch of chemicals we refer to as DNA. Compounds, chemicals, chemical reactions ... these are what produce the structures & functions within the basic units of structure & function for living things (cells). Anyhoo ... our topic right now, namely photosynthesis, is arguably one of the most important chemical reactions occurring on the planet. Let's see why. Let's begin with some basic questions & answers about photosynthesis. QUESTION ANSWER What is photosynthesis? Photosynthesis is a chemical reaction in which light energy is converted to chemical energy in glucose. It is the means by which the energy in sunlight becomes usable to living things. Living things can eat glucose, we can't eat sunlight. Exactly why is photosynthesis so important? Two big reasons. One product of photosynthesis is glucose (sugar), which provides the basis for most food chains. The second product of photosynthesis is oxygen which comes in handy if your happen to be an aerobic organism that requires oxygen for survival. Where does photosythesis occur? This question can be answered on various levels. On the planetary level, most photosynthesis occurs in the oceans, because the oceans occupy the vast majority (70%) of the earth's surface. In terms of organisms, photosynthesis occurs in autotrophes that contain the green pigment chlorophyll. This would include the entire plant kingdom, ""half"" of the Protista (the algae), & ""half"" the Moneran Kingdom (the blue-green algae). On the multicellular level, photosynthesis occurs in the leaves of plants. We will take an up-close & personal look at these in a bit ... On the cellular level, the reactions for photosynthesis occur in organelles called chloroplasts (in eukaryotic cells). Blue-green algae (which are prokaryotic) carry-out the photosythesis reactions in the cytoplasm. What raw materials are needed for the process of photosynthesis? As mentioned in the above box, chlorophyll must be present. (Chlorophyll absorbs solar energy). Sunlight is necessary. That's why we call it PHOTOsynthesis. And from the environment, photosynthetic organisms must get water & carbon dioxide. To which ""life function"" is photosynthesis related? Photosynthesis falls under nutrition, autotrophic nutrition to be exact. Nutrition has to do with how organisms obtain the materials necessary for energy, growth, etc. We call these necessary materials nutients. ""Autotrophic"" means that the organism makes the nutrients on its own using materials in the environment (see the above box). How can we summarize photosynthesis ? In words, remember this: carbon dioixde + water + light energy ---> glucose + oxygen + water As a chemical reaction it's like so: CO2 + H2O + light energy ---> C6H12O6 + O2 + H2O We'll get back to this equation later ... What else should we remember about photosynthesis? Well, it's an important component of the Oxygen-Carbon Dioxide Cycle. Organisms that carry-out photosynthesis are like oxygen factories. At the same time they are removing CO2 from the atmosphere. Increasing levels of CO2 appear to go hand in hand with increasing global temperature (""Global Warming""). So damaging the ecosystems where photosynthesis occurs (i.e. the rainforests, the oceans) reduces the amount of oxygen being pumped into the air (that's a bad thing) & slows the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere (which also appears to be a bad thing). For the most part, when thinking of organisms that carry-out photosynthesis, it is safe to picture plants. It's not that we have any right to ignore the photosynthetic Protists & Monerans, but, well, it sure is easier to picture a tree than a Euglena. Don't you agree? Remember, it turns out that most photosynthesis on Earth is occurring in the oceans, & the organisms in the oceans doing the job happen to be classified into the Protist Kingdom --- algae (seaweeds), diatoms, etc. So let's not forget them completely. Having said that, let's take a look at plants & how they are adapted for photosynthesis. The leaves of plants are the photosynthesis factories. The structure of a ""typical"" leaf is illustrated in the following table. LEAF LAYERS This pic shows a leaf cross section with only the layers labelled. Please note that each roundish shape is a single plant cell. So each layer is a plant tissue (a group of cells). The top & bottom layers are both referred to as an epidermis (outer layer). The upper epidermis (colored purple) & the lower epidermis (colored red) basically are protective layers. They are coated with a waxy surface, the cuticle, which further protects the leaf & prevents excess water loss. The area sandwiched in the middle of the leaf is referred to as ""mesophyll"". There are two layers in the mesophyll: 1) the palisade layer - packed tight w/ oval cells 2) the spongy layer - this area contains circular cells that are spread out --- allowing gases to circulate within the leaf THE VASCULAR BUNDLE (VEIN) If you've ever looked closely at a leaf you've noticed some pattern of lines running through it. These lines are veins, or ""vascular bundles"" (the side of one bundle is colored light green). Inside the vascular bundle are tubes that transport materials from place to place in the plant. The xylem (colored blue) transport water & minerals from the roots, through the stem, & into the leaves (remember ... we need water for photosynthesis). Phloem (colored orange) are tubes that transport ""food"" through the plant. This ""food"" is basically sugary water (sap). The sugars are synthesized (made) during photosynthesis. STOMATES & GUARD CELLS Scattered about the lower epidermis are small openings called stomata. It is through these holes that carbon dioxide enters the leaf, & oxygen & water vapor exit. Each stomate is surrounded by a pair of guard cells. When guard cells swell, the stomates close, when the guard cells shrink, the stomates are open. Plants respond to changes in temperature & humidity by opening or closing their stomata (an example of maintaining ... homeostasis). CHLOROPLASTS All of the ""black dots"" in the picture represent chloroplasts, which are the cell organelles in plant cells where the chemical reactions of photosynthesis take place. You should notice that the vast majority of chloroplasts are found in the cells of the mesophyll. Even more specifically, the palisade layer has the most chloroplasts, so the greatest amount of photosynthesis occurs in that leaf layer. Now let's revisit the summary equation for photosynthesis & note how each of the raw materials end up in the chloroplasts so that the whole photosynthesis deal can go down. Now let's do the same, except pay attention to what happens to the products of photosynthesis. I should mention that glucose may be used for things other than energy. For example, a whole bunch of glucoses could be combined (by dehydration synthesis) to form cellulose, which is the structural material of the cell wall surrounding plant cells. It could also be converted to starch (again by dehydration synthesis) & stored by the plant for future use. Alright, that is ""the big picture"" --- what photosynthesis is, why it's important, & how plants are adapted to carry it out. I'm afraid there is more chemistry to it, I have placed that info on a separate page, the ""yucky chemistry details"". Check it out when you have a chance, but not on a full stomach.

Have you ever noticed that plants need sunlight to live? It seems sort of strange doesn't it? How can sunlight be a type of food? Well, sunlight is energy and photosynthesis is the process plants use to take the energy from sunlight and use it to convert carbon dioxide and water into food. Three things plants need to live Plants need three basic things to live: water, sunlight, and carbon dioxide. Plants breathe carbon dioxide just like we breathe oxygen. When plants breathe carbon dioxide in, they breathe out oxygen. Plants are the major source of oxygen on planet Earth and help keep us alive. We know now that plants use sunlight as energy, they get water from rain, and they get carbon dioxide from breathing. The process of taking these three key ingredients and making them into food is called photosynthesis. How do plants capture sunlight? Plants capture sunlight using a compound called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is green, which is why so many plants appear green. You might think at first that it's green because it wants to absorb and use green light. However, from our study of light, we know that the color we see is actually the color of light that is reflected. So chlorophyll actually reflects green light and absorbs blue and red light. More details on Photosynthesis Inside a plant's cells are structures called chloroplasts. It's in these structures where the chlorophyll resides. There are two main phases to the process of photosynthesis. In the first phase, sunlight is captured by the chloroplasts and the energy is stored in a chemical called ATP. In the second phase, the ATP is used to create sugar and organic compounds. These are the foods plants use to live and grow. The first phase of the process must have sunlight, but the second phase can happen without sunlight and even at night. The second phase is called the Calvin Cycle because it was discovered and described by scientist Melvin Calvin. Even though plants need sunlight and water to live, different plants need different amounts of each. Some plants need just a little water while others need a lot. Some plants like to be in the direct sunlight all day, while others prefer the shade. Learning about the needs of plants can help you learn where to plant them in your yard and how best to water them so they will flourish. Summary Now we know that plants need sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to live. They take these three components and use chlorophyll to help convert them into food, which they use for energy, and oxygen, which they breathe out and we use to live. All plants use photosynthesis, so they all need some sunlight. Activities Take a ten question about this page.

Photosynthesis is defined as the process, utilized by green plants and photosynthetic bacteria, where electromagnetic radiation is converted into chemical energy and uses light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen. Image created using . The carbohydrates formed from photosynthesis provide not only the necessary energy form the energy transfer within ecosystems, but also the carbon molecules to make a wide array of biomolecules. Photosynthesis is a light-driven oxidation-reduction reaction where the energy from the light is used to oxidize water, releasing oxygen gas and hydrogen ions, followed by the transfer of electrons to carbon dioxide, reducing it to organic molecules. Photosynthetic organisms are called autotrophs because they can synthesize chemical fuels such as glucose from carbon dioxide and water by utilizing sunlight as an energy source. Other organisms that obtain energy from other organisms also ultimately depend on autotrophs for energy. One of the essential requirements for photosynthesis is the green pigment ‘chlorophyll’ which is present in the chloroplasts of green plants and some bacteria. The pigment is essential for ‘capturing’ sunlight which then drives the overall process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis equations/reactions/formula The process of photosynthesis differs in green plants and sulfur bacteria. In plants, water is utilized along with carbon dioxide to release glucose and oxygen molecules. In the case of sulfur bacteria, hydrogen sulfide is utilized along with carbon dioxide to release carbohydrates, sulfur, and water molecules. Oxygenic Photosynthesis The overall reaction of photosynthesis in plants is as follows: Carbon dioxide + Water + solar energy → Glucose + Oxygen 6CO2 + 6H2O + solar energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 OR Carbon dioxide + Water + solar energy → Glucose + Oxygen + Water 6CO2 + 12H2O+ solar energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 + 6H2O Anoxygenic Photosynthesis The overall reaction of photosynthesis in sulfur bacteria is as follows: CO2 + 2H2S + light energy → (CH2O) + H2O + 2S Video Animation: Photosynthesis (Crash Course) Photosynthetic pigments Photosynthetic pigments are the molecules involved in absorbing electromagnetic radiation, transferring the energy of the absorbed photons to the reaction center, resulting in photochemical reactions in the organisms capable of photosynthesis. The molecules of photosynthetic pigments are quite ubiquitous and are always composed of chlorophylls and carotenoids. In addition to chlorophyll, photosynthetic systems also contain another pigment, pheophytin (bacteriopheophytin in bacteria), which plays a crucial role in the transfer of electrons in photosynthetic systems. Moreover, other pigments can be found in particular photosynthetic systems, such as xanthophylls in plants. Image Source: . Chlorophyll Chlorophyll is the pigment molecule, which is the principal photoreceptor in the chloroplasts of most green plants. Chlorophylls consist of a porphyrin ring, which is bounded to an ion Mg2+, attached to a phytol chain. Chlorophylls are very effective photoreceptors because they contain networks of alternating single and double bonds. In chlorophyll, the electrons are not localized to a particular atomic nucleus and consequently can more readily absorb light energy. In addition, chlorophylls also have solid absorption bands in the visible region of the spectrum. Chlorophylls are found either in the cytoplasmic membranes of photosynthetic bacteria, or thylakoid membranes inside plant chloroplasts. Bacteriorhodopsin Bacteriorhodopsin is another class of photosynthetic pigment that exists only in halobacteria. It is composed of a protein attached to a retinal prosthetic group. This pigment is responsible for the absorption of light photons, leading to a conformational change in the protein, which results in the expulsion of the protons from the cell. Phycobilins Cyanobacteria and red algae employ phycobilins such as phycoerythrobilin and phycocyanobilin as their light-harvesting pigments. These open-chain tetrapyrroles have the extended polyene system found in chlorophylls, but not their cyclic structure or central Mg2+. Phycobilins are covalently linked to specific binding proteins, forming phycobiliproteins, which associate in highly ordered complexes called phycobilisomes that constitute the primary light-harvesting structures in these microorganisms. Carotenoids In addition to chlorophylls, thylakoid membranes contain secondary light-absorbing pigments, or accessory pigments, called carotenoids. Carotenoids may be yellow, red, or purple. The most important are β-carotene, which is a red-orange isoprenoid, and the yellow carotenoid lutein. The carotenoid pigments absorb light at wavelengths not absorbed by the chlorophylls and thus are supplementary light receptors. Factors affecting photosynthesis Blackman formulated the Law of limiting factors while studying the factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis. This Law states that the rate of a physiological process will be limited by the factor which is in the shortest supply. In the same way, the rate of photosynthesis is also affected by a number of factors, which are namely; Light As the intensity of light increases, the rate of light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis and in turn, the rate of photosynthesis increases. With increased light intensity, the number of photons falling on a leaf also increases. As a result, more chlorophyll molecules are ionized, and more ATPs and NADH are generated. After a point, however, the rate of photosynthesis remains constant as the light intensity increases. At this point, photosynthesis is limited by some other factors. Besides, the wavelength of light also affects the rate of photosynthesis. Different photosynthetic systems absorb light energy more effectively at different wavelengths. Carbon dioxide An increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide increases the rate at which carbon is incorporated into carbohydrates in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis. Thus, increasing the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rapidly increases the rate of photosynthesis up to a point after which it is limited by some other factors. Temperature The light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are affected by changes in temperature as they are catalyzed by enzymes, whereas the light-dependent reactions are not. The rate of the reactions increases as the enzymes reach their optimum temperature, after which the rate begins to decrease as the enzymes tend to denature. Process/ Steps of Photosynthesis The overall process of photosynthesis can be objectively divided into four steps/ process: 1. Absorption of light The first step in photosynthesis is the absorption of light by chlorophylls that are attached to the proteins in the thylakoids of chloroplasts. The light energy absorbed is then used to remove electrons from an electron donor like water, forming oxygen. The electrons are further transferred to a primary electron acceptor, quinine (Q) which is similar to CoQ in the electron transfer chain. 2. Electron Transfer The electrons are now further transferred from the primary electron acceptor through a chain of electron transfer molecules present in the thylakoid membrane to the final electron acceptor, which is usually NADP+. As the electrons are transferred through the membrane, protons are pumped out of the membrane, resulting in the proton gradient across the membrane. 3. Generation of ATP The movement of protons from the thylakoid lumen to the stroma through the F0F1 complex results in the generation of ATP from ADP and Pi. This step is identical to the step of the generation of ATP in the . 4. Carbon Fixation The NADP and ATP generated in steps 2 and 3 provide energy, and the electrons drive the process of reducing carbon into six-carbon sugar molecules. The first three steps of photosynthesis are directly dependent on light energy and are thus, called light reactions, whereas the reactions in this step are independent of light and thus are termed dark reactions. Types/ Stages/ Parts of photosynthesis Figure: Photosynthesis takes place in two stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Light-dependent reactions, which take place in the thylakoid membrane, use light energy to make ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, uses energy derived from these compounds to make GA3P from CO2. Image Source: . Photosynthesis is divided into two stages based on the utilization of light energy: 1. Light-dependent reactions The light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis only take place when the plants/ bacteria are illuminated. In the light-dependent reactions, chlorophyll and other pigments of photosynthetic cells absorb light energy and conserve it as ATP and NADPH while simultaneously, evolving O2 gas. In the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, the chlorophyll absorbs high energy, short-wavelength light, which excites the electrons present inside the thylakoid membrane. The excitation of electrons now initiates the transformation of light energy into chemical energy. The light reactions take in two photosystems that are present in the thylakoid of chloroplasts. Figure: Light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis in the thylakoid membrane of plant cells. Image Source: . Photosystem II Photosystem II is a group of proteins and pigments that work together to absorb light energy and transfer electrons through a chain of molecules until it finally reaches an electron acceptor. Photosystem II has a pair of chlorophyll molecules, also known as P680 as the molecules best absorb light of the wavelength 680 nm. The P680 donates a pair of electrons after absorbing light energy, resulting in an oxidized form of P680. Finally, an enzyme catalyzes the splitting of a water molecule into two electrons, two hydrogen ion, and oxygen molecules. This pair of electrons then are transferred to P680, causing it to return to its initial stage. Photosystem I Photosystem I is a similar complex like photosystem II except for that photosystem I have a pair of chlorophyll molecules known as P700 as they best absorb the wavelength of 700 nm. As photosystem I absorb light energy, it also becomes excited and transfers electrons. The now oxidized form of P700 then accepts an electron from photosystem II, restring back to its initial stage. The electrons from photosystem I are then passed in a series of redox reactions through the protein ferredoxin. The electrons finally reach NADP+, reducing them to NADPH. Reaction 2 H2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 ADP + 3 Pi + light → 2 NADPH + 2 H+ + 3 ATP + O2 Video Animation: The Light Reactions of Photosynthesis (Ricochet Science) 2. Light independent reactions (Calvin cycle) Light independent reactions of photosynthesis are anabolic reactions that lead to the formation of a sex-carbon compound, glucose in plants. The reactions in this stage are also termed dark reactions as they are not directly dependent on the light energy but do require the products formed from the light reactions. Figure: Overview of the Calvin cycle pathway. Image Source: . This stage consists of 3 further steps that lead to carbon fixation/ assimilation. Step 1: Fixation of CO2 into 3-phosphoglycerate In this step, one CO2 molecule is covalently attached to the five-carbon compound ribulose 1,5-biphosphate catalyzed by the enzyme ribulose 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase, also called rubisco. The attachment results in the formation of an unstable six-carbon compound that is then cleaved to form two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. Step 2: Conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate The 3-phosphoglycerate formed in step 1 is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate by two separate reactions. At first, enzyme 3-phosphoglycerate kinase present in the stroma catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from ATP to 3-phosphoglycerate, yielding 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. Next, NADPH donates electrons in a reaction catalyzed by the chloroplast-specific isozyme of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, producing glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and phosphate (Pi). Most of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate thus produced is used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The rest of the glyceraldehyde is either converted to starch in the chloroplast and stored for later use or is exported to the cytosol and converted to sucrose for transport to growing regions of the plant. Step 3: Regeneration of ribulose 1,5-biphosphate from triose phosphates The three-carbon compounds formed in the previous steps are then converted into the five-carbon compound, ribulose 1,5-biphosphate through a series of transformations with intermediates of three-, four,-, five-, six-, and seven-carbon sugar. As the first molecules in the process, if regenerated, this stage of photosynthesis results in a cycle (Calvin cycle). Reaction 3 CO2 + 9 ATP + 6 NADPH + 6 H+ → glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) + 9 ADP + 8 Pi + 6 NADP+ + 3 H2O A G3P molecule contains three fixed carbon atoms, so it takes two G3Ps to build a six-carbon glucose molecule. It would take six turns of the cycle to produce one molecule of glucose. Video Animation: The Calvin Cycle (Ricochet Science) Products of Photosynthesis The outcomes of light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis are: ATP NADPH O2 H+ ions The products of light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) of photosynthesis are: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) / Glucose (carbohydrates) H+ ions The overall products of photosynthesis are: Glucose (carbohydrates) Water Oxygen Sulfur (in photosynthetic sulfur bacteria) Photosynthesis examples Photosynthesis in green plants or oxygenic bacteria In plants and oxygenic bacteria like cyanobacteria, photosynthesis takes place in the presence of green pigment, chlorophyll. It takes place in the thylakoids of the chloroplasts, resulting in products like oxygen gas, glucose, and water molecules. Most of the glucose units in plants are linked to form starch or fructose or even sucrose. Photosynthesis in sulfur bacteria In purple sulfur bacteria, photosynthesis takes place in the presence of hydrogen sulfur rather than water. Some of these bacteria like green sulfur bacteria have chlorophyll whereas other purple sulfur bacteria have carotenoids as photosynthetic pigments. The result of photosynthesis in these bacteria are carbohydrates (not necessarily glucose), sulfur gas, and water molecules. Importance of photosynthesis Photosynthesis is the primary source of energy in autotrophs where they make their food by utilizing carbon dioxide, sunlight, and photosynthetic pigments. Photosynthesis is equally essential for heterotrophs, as they derive their energy from the autotrophs. Photosynthesis in plants is necessary to maintain the oxygen levels in the atmosphere. Besides, the products of photosynthesis contribute to the carbon cycle occurring in the oceans, land, plants, and animals. Similarly, it also helps maintain a symbiotic relationship between plants, animals, and humans. Sunlight or solar energy is the primary source of all other forms of energy on earth, which is utilized through the process of photosynthesis. Artificial photosynthesis Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that mimics the biological process of utilization of sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. Image Source: . In artificial photosynthesis, photocatalysts are utilized that are capable of replicating the oxidation-reduction reactions taking place during natural photosynthesis. The main function of artificial photosynthesis is to produce solar fuel from sunlight that can be stored and used under conditions, where sunlight is not available. As solar fuels are prepared, artificial photosynthesis can be used to produce just oxygen from water and sunlight, resulting in clean energy production. The most important part of artificial photosynthesis is the photocatalytic splitting of a water molecule, resulting in oxygen and large quantities of hydrogen gas. Further, light-driven carbon reduction can also be performed to replicate the process of natural carbon fixation, resulting in carbohydrates molecules. Thus, artificial photosynthesis has applications in the production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry, engineering of enzymes, and photoautotrophic microorganisms for the production of microbial biofuel and biohydrogen from sunlight.

0,life.illinois,How plants make food from sunlight and air - Times of India,https://www.life.illinois.edu/govindjee/encyc/encarta.htm,"Photosynthesis article provided by Encarta Encyclopedia 2000 PHOTOSYNTHESIS INTRODUCTION Photosynthesis, process by which green plants and certain other organisms use the energy of light to convert carbon dioxide and water into the simple sugar glucose. In so doing, photosynthesis provides the basic energy source for virtually all organisms. An extremely important byproduct of photosynthesis is oxygen, on which most organisms depend. Photosynthesis occurs in green plants, seaweeds, algae, and certain bacteria. These organisms are veritable sugar factories, producing millions of new glucose molecules per second. Plants use much of this glucose, a carbohydrate, as an energy source to build leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. They also convert glucose to cellulose, the structural material used in their cell walls. Most plants produce more glucose than they use, however, and they store it in the form of starch and other carbohydrates in roots, stems, and leaves. The plants can then draw on these reserves for extra energy or building materials. Each year, photosynthesizing organisms produce about 170 billion metric tons of extra carbohydrates, about 30 metric tons for every person on earth. Photosynthesis has far-reaching implications. Like plants, humans and other animals depend on glucose as an energy source, but they are unable to produce it on their own and must rely ultimately on the glucose produced by plants. Moreover, the oxygen humans and other animals breathe is the oxygen released during photosynthesis. Humans are also dependent on ancient products of photosynthesis, known as fossil fuels, for supplying most of our modern industrial energy. These fossil fuels, including natural gas, coal, and petroleum, are composed of a complex mix of hydrocarbons, the remains of organisms that relied on photosynthesis millions of years ago. Thus, virtually all life on earth, directly or indirectly, depends on photosynthesis as a source of food, energy, and oxygen, making it one of the most important biochemical processes known. WHERE PHOTOSYNTHESIS OCCURS Plant photosynthesis occurs in leaves and green stems within specialized cell structures called chloroplasts. One plant leaf is composed of tens of thousands of cells, and each cell contains 40 to 50 chloroplasts. The chloroplast, an oval-shaped structure, is divided by membranes into numerous disk-shaped compartments. These disklike compartments, called thylakoids, are arranged vertically in the chloroplast like a stack of plates or pancakes. A stack of thylakoids is called a granum (plural, grana); the grana lie suspended in a fluid known as stroma. Embedded in the membranes of the thylakoids are hundreds of molecules of chlorophyll, a light-trapping pigment required for photosynthesis. Additional light-trapping pigments, enzymes (organic substances that speed up chemical reactions), and other molecules needed for photosynthesis are also located within the thylakoid membranes. The pigments and enzymes are arranged in two types of units, Photosystem I and Photosystem II. Because a chloroplast may have dozens of thylakoids, and each thylakoid may contain thousands of photosystems, each chloroplast will contain millions of pigment molecules. HOW PHOTOSYNTHESIS WORKS Photosynthesis is a very complex process, and for the sake of convenience and ease of understanding, plant biologists divide it into two stages. In the first stage, the light-dependent reaction, the chloroplast traps light energy and converts it into chemical energy contained in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), two molecules used in the second stage of photosynthesis. In the second stage, called the light-independent reaction (formerly called the dark reaction), NADPH provides the hydrogen atoms that help form glucose, and ATP provides the energy for this and other reactions used to synthesize glucose. These two stages reflect the literal meaning of the term photosynthesis, to build with light. AThe Light-Dependent Reaction Photosynthesis relies on flows of energy and electrons initiated by light energy. Electrons are minute particles that travel in a specific orbit around the nuclei of atoms and carry a small electrical charge. Light energy causes the electrons in chlorophyll and other light-trapping pigments to boost up and out of their orbit; the electrons instantly fall back into place, releasing resonance energy, or vibrating energy, as they go, all in millionths of a second. Chlorophyll and the other pigments are clustered next to one another in the photosystems, and the vibrating energy passes rapidly from one chlorophyll or pigment molecule to the next, like the transfer of energy in billiard balls. Light contains many colors, each with a defined range of wavelengths measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. Certain red and blue wavelengths of light are the most effective in photosynthesis because they have exactly the right amount of energy to energize, or excite, chlorophyll electrons and boost them out of their orbits to a higher energy level. Other pigments, called accessory pigments, enhance the light-absorption capacity of the leaf by capturing a broader spectrum of blue and red wavelengths, along with yellow and orange wavelengths. None of the photosynthetic pigments absorb green light; as a result, green wavelengths are reflected, which is why plants appear green. Photosynthesis begins when light strikes Photosystem I pigments and excites their electrons. The energy passes rapidly from molecule to molecule until it reaches a special chlorophyll molecule called P700, so named because it absorbs light in the red region of the spectrum at wavelengths of 700 nanometers. Until this point, only energy has moved from molecule to molecule; now electrons themselves transfer between molecules. P700 uses the energy of the excited electrons to boost its own electrons to an energy level that enables an adjoining electron acceptor molecule to capture them. The electrons are then passed down a chain of carrier molecules, called an electron transport chain. The electrons are passed from one carrier molecule to another in a downhill direction, like individuals in a bucket brigade passing water from the top of a hill to the bottom. Each electron carrier is at a lower energy level than the one before it, and the result is that electrons release energy as they move down the chain. At the end of the electron transport chain lies the molecule nicotine adenine dinucleotide (NADP+). Using the energy released by the flow of electrons, two electrons from the electron transport chain combine with a hydrogen ion and NADP+ to form NADPH. When P700 transfers its electrons to the electron acceptor, it becomes deficient in electrons. Before it can function again, it must be replenished with new electrons. Photosystem II accomplishes this task. As in Photosystem I, light energy activates electrons of the Photosystem II pigments. These pigments transfer the energy of their excited electrons to a special Photosystem II chlorophyll molecule, P680, that absorbs light best in the red region at 680 nanometers. Just as in Photosystem I, energy is transferred among pigment molecules and is then directed to the P680 chlorophyll, where the energy is used to transfer electrons from P680 to its adjoining electron acceptor molecule. From the Photosystem II electron acceptor, the electrons are passed through a different electron transport chain. As they pass along the cascade of electron carrier molecules, the electrons give up some of their energy to fuel the production of ATP, formed by the addition of one phosphorous atom to adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Eventually, the electron transport carrier molecules deliver the Photosystem II electrons to Photosystem I, which uses them to maintain the flow of electrons to P700, thus restoring its function. P680 in Photosystem II is now electron deficient because it has donated electrons to P700 in Photosystem I. P680 electrons are replenished by the water that has been absorbed by the plant roots and transported to the chloroplasts in the leaves. The movement of electrons in Photosystems I and II and the action of an enzyme split the water into oxygen, hydrogen ions, and electrons. The electrons from water flow to Photosystem II, replacing the electrons lost by P680. Some of the hydrogen ions may be used to produce NADPH at the end of the electron transport chain, and the oxygen from the water diffuses out of the chloroplast and is released into the atmosphere through pores in the leaf. The transfer of electrons in a step-by-step fashion in Photosystems I and II releases energy and heat slowly, thus protecting the chloroplast and cell from a harmful temperature increase. It also provides time for the plant to form NADPH and ATP. In the words of American biochemist and Nobel laureate Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, ""What drives life is thus a little electric current, set up by the sunshine."" BThe Light-Independent Reaction The chemical energy required for the light-independent reaction is supplied by the ATP and NADPH molecules produced in the light-dependent reaction. The light-independent reaction is cyclic, that is, it begins with a molecule that must be regenerated at the end of the reaction in order for the process to continue. Termed the Calvin cycle after the American chemist Melvin Calvin who discovered it, the light-independent reactions use the electrons and hydrogen ions associated with NADPH and the phosphorous associated with ATP to produce glucose. These reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid in the chloroplast surrounding the thylakoids, and each step is controlled by a different enzyme. The light-independent reaction requires the presence of carbon dioxide molecules, which enter the plant through pores in the leaf, diffuse through the cell to the chloroplast, and disperse in the stroma. The light-independent reaction begins in the stroma when these carbon dioxide molecules link to sugar molecules called ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) in a process known as carbon fixation. With the help of an enzyme, six molecules of carbon dioxide bond to six molecules of RuBP to create six new molecules. Several intermediate steps, which require ATP, NADPH, and additional enzymes, rearrange the position of the carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in these six molecules, and when the reactions are complete, one new molecule of glucose has been constructed and five molecules of RuBP have been reconstructed. This process occurs repeatedly in each chloroplast as long as carbon dioxide, ATP, and NADPH are available. The thousands of glucose molecules produced in this reaction are processed by the plant to produce energy in the process known as aerobic respiration, used as structural materials, or stored. The regenerated RuBP is used to start the Calvin cycle all over again. PHOTOSYNTHESIS VARIATIONS A majority of plants use these steps in photosynthesis. Plants such as corn and crabgrass that have evolved in hot, dry environments, however, must overcome certain obstacles to photosynthesis. On hot days, they partially close the pores in their leaves to prevent the escape of water. With the pores only slightly open, adequate amounts of carbon dioxide cannot enter the leaf, and the Calvin cycle comes to a halt. To get around this problem, certain hot-weather plants have developed a way to keep carbon dioxide flowing to the stroma without capturing it directly from the air. They open their pores slightly, take in carbon dioxide, and transport it deep within the leaves. Here they stockpile it in a chemical form that releases the carbon dioxide slowly and steadily into the Calvin cycle. With this system, these plants can continue photosynthesis on hot days, even with their pores almost completely closed. A field of corn thus remains green on blistering days when neighboring plants wither, and crabgrass thrives in lawns browned by the summer sun. Bacteria lack chloroplasts, and instead use structures called chromatophores-membranes formed by numerous foldings of the plasma membrane, the membrane surrounding the fluid, or cytoplasm, that fills the cell. The chromatophores house thylakoids similar to plant thylakoids, which in some bacteria contain chlorophyll. For these bacteria, the process of photosynthesis is similar to that of plants, algae, and seaweed. Many of these chlorophyll-containing bacteria are abundant in oceans, lakes, and rivers, and the oxygen they release dissolves in the water and enables fish and other aquatic organisms to survive. Certain archaebacteria, members of a group of primitive bacteria-like organisms, carry out photosynthesis in a different manner. The mud-dwelling green sulfur and purple sulfur archaebacteria use hydrogen sulfide instead of water in photosynthesis. These archaebacteria release sulfur rather than oxygen, which, along with hydrogen sulfide, imparts the rotten egg smell to mudflats. Halobacteria, archaebacteria found in the salt flats of deserts, rely on the pigment bacteriorhodopsin instead of chlorophyll for photosynthesis. These archaebacteria do not carry out the complete process of photosynthesis; although they produce ATP in a process similar to the light-dependent reaction and use it for energy, they do not produce glucose. Halobacteria are among the most ancient organisms, and may have been the starting point for the evolution of photosynthesis. While it may seem that we understand photosynthesis in detail, decades of experiments have given us only a partial understanding of this important process. A more thorough understanding of the details of photosynthesis may pave the way for development of crops that are more efficient at using the sun's energy, producing food for increasingly bountiful harvests.

0,canr.msu,How plants make food from sunlight and air - Times of India,https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_important_role_of_photosynthesis,"The important role of photosynthesis - MSU Extension Search Search The important role of photosynthesis Bill Cook, - April 09, 2013 Photosynthesis is not just about oxygen production it is also about energy production. Most people would agree that photosynthesis is a great thing. I’ve never heard anyone argue against it. However, some folks have missed the purpose of photosynthesis. It’s not oxygen production. The primary function of photosynthesis is to convert solar energy into chemical energy and then store that chemical energy for future use. For the most part, the planet’s living systems are powered by this process. It’s not particularly efficient by human engineering standards, but it does the job. Photosynthesis happens in regions of a cell called chloroplasts. The chemistry and physics are complex. It’s a bit humbling to consider that the energy in our bodies travels 93 million miles in a little more than eight minutes, and that life has tapped into that energy stream. For a short time that energy is tied up in biological systems before it continues on its merry way into the dark of space. In essence, green plants take carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from the molecules of carbon dioxide and water, and then recombine them into a new molecule called glucose. This happens in the presence of sunlight, of course. Energy is stored in the bonds of the glucose molecule. Glucose is a fairly simple sugar, easy to break down. Ever wonder why kids bounce off the walls and ceilings soon after a good dose of sugar? Chemically speaking, the inputs to photosynthesis are six carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms and 18 oxygen atoms. Glucose uses six carbon, 12 hydrogen, and six oxygen molecules. Simple math shows 12 leftover oxygen atoms, or six oxygen molecules. Oxygen atoms prefer mates. Interestingly, and not coincidentally, the process of respiration breaks apart the glucose molecule. Respiration occurs in the cells of nearly all living things. The released energy is then used for all sorts of metabolic activity, including the energy that you are using to read this article. Respiration happens in regions of a cell called mitochondria. The chemical reactions are the reverse of photosynthesis, using a glucose molecule and six oxygen molecules (12 atoms) as inputs. Energy is released along with some carbon dioxide and water. But this is enough chemistry. Trees and other green plants practice respiration, too, just like animals, but they also practice photosynthesis. This is why ecologists categorize green plants as “producers” and most every other life form as a “consumer.” It’s about the energy. OK, there are decomposers, too, but that’s another story and they’re still dependent upon the energy captured by the producers. Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis and, correspondingly, carbon dioxide the byproduct of respiration. Trees are often credited as the major oxygen generator for the planet, but that would be false. Most of the planet is covered with water and the collective photosynthesis of lowly algae is the true oxygen machine. Nevertheless, trees and forests are, indeed, significant oxygen producers. However, if oxygen was the only benefit of trees and forests, we could easily live without them. And some forests actually produce more carbon dioxide than oxygen. Fortunately, the benefits of both trees and forests extend far beyond something as narrow as oxygen production. Much of the basic structural material of plants and wood is cellulose, which is an especially complex sugar. The constituent molecules of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen can be recombined to form lots of useful chemicals such as ethanol, perfumes, bioplastics, clothing fabrics and a range of industrial ingredients. It’s generally agreed that sources from within renewable living ecosystems have distinct advantages over using the ancient materials that make up fossil fuels. Plants and photosynthesis are the basis of fossil fuels, too, but from millions and millions of years ago. Bringing huge volumes of those molecules back into living ecosystems has a few drawbacks that science has gotten pretty good at measuring and describing. Trees, forests, forest soils and forest products are mighty important in the cycling of carbon and the relative size of various carbon pools. There are other elements that also cycle through forests. Science has a pretty good handle on these relationships, too. Michigan residents might do well to place a bit more weight on these service benefits of trees, forests, and forest management. As for photosynthesis itself, maybe it’s better if we think more about the energy capture and less about the oxygen production. This article was published by . For more information, visit .

Less well-known but equally important are algae, which also perform the important task of changing carbon dioxide to oxygen. Plant-like protists, one-celled organisms containing chloroplasts, make their own contribution to the food chain and the conversion of carbon dioxide to oxygen. What do these organisms have in common? They all perform photosynthesis. The Photosynthesis Process The photosynthesis process uses the sun's energy to combine carbon dioxide and water to form glucose, a sugar. Carbon dioxide enters plants through tiny pores in the bottoms of leaves or by diffusion through cell membranes in the case of algae and protists. Water enters by a variety of means, usually roots, but also by osmosis, which lets water pass through the cell membranes. The sun's energy, absorbed by the green chemical chlorophyll, fuels the chemical reaction that combines the carbon dioxide molecules with the water molecules to form glucose, one type of sugar, and release oxygen as a waste product. The glucose can be stored in fruits, roots and stems of plants and released through the reverse process of respiration, where oxygen is used to break the glucose down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing the stored energy. The Equation for Photosynthesis The photosynthesis equation is written as: 6H2O + 6CO2 → C6H12O6 + 6O2 and is explained in words as the reaction of six water molecules with six carbon dioxide molecules yielding one glucose molecule and six oxygen molecules. Note that one oxygen molecule contains a pair of oxygen atoms. Photosynthesis Definition The word photosynthesis literally breaks down into ""photo,"" Greek for ""light,"" and ""synthesis,"" a Greek word meaning ""composition"" or putting together. So, photosynthesis actually means to put together using light. Plants, algae and plant-like protists use sunlight to put together carbon dioxide and water to make sugar. Importance of Photosynthesis A chemical explanation of photosynthesis doesn't begin to convey the importance of this process. Earth's early atmosphere, composed of carbon dioxide and other gases spewed out of volcanoes, gradually changed to the modern oxygen-rich atmosphere by photosynthesizing blue-green algae. The conversion of carbon dioxide and water to sugar provides food not only for the plant but also for almost all animal life. While plants provide most of the food on land, algae and plant-like protists provide food for most aquatic food chains. Over time, many interdependent relationships between plants and animals have developed, like the pollination of plants by insects, birds or bats. Ultimately, however, many plants would survive without animals, but most animals cannot live without plants or other photosynthesizing organisms. Photosynthesis vs. Chemosynthesis It is hard to explain photosynthesis without a brief note regarding chemosynthesis. Chemosynthesis uses chemical reactions to release energy and form sugars. While photosynthetic reactions only have one equation, chemosynthetic reactions vary depending on the organism. One chemosynthetic reaction, performed by bacteria at deep-sea hydrothermal vents, combines hydrogen sulfide, oxygen and carbon dioxide to form formaldehyde (H-CHO, sometimes written as CH2O) and release sulfur and water. Other chemosynthetic bacteria oxidize methane or reduce sulfides to release energy. Chemosynthetic bacteria form the base of the food chain in deep ocean communities where sunlight doesn't penetrate. Chemosynthetic bacteria also occur in some hot springs on land. Related Articles References About the Author Karen earned her Bachelor of Science in geology.

Using just three simple ingredients (carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight) plants and bacteria are able to make their own food. Early forms of algae and bacteria were the first organisms to photosynthesize. Scientists estimate that it takes approximately 2,000 years of photosynthetic activity to ""turn over"" or replenish all the oxygen in the earth's biosphere. Fortunately for all animals, including humans and fish, oxygen is a by-product of this process. As long as photosynthesis is occurring, oxygen is continuously being released into the air and into the world's lakes, oceans, rivers, and ponds. Photosynthesis by algae, bacteria, and plants provides the air that humans breathe. The Basics of Photosynthesis Without photosynthesis, life as we know it would not be possible In most plants, photosynthesis occurs in special cells known as chloroplasts. The green hue we see in plants is the result of tiny grains of green pigment (light-absorbing molecules) inside the chloroplasts. These pigments are commonly known as chlorophyll (chloro=green; phyll=leaf). Different types of plants use different forms of chlorophyll for photosynthesis. Chlorophyll a is the pigment directly responsible for transforming light energy (sunlight) into chemical energy (carbohydrates). Many plants also contain chlorophyll b and chlorophyll c, pigments which help carry out other chemical processes. Aquatic Plants and Photosynthesis Plants, including aquatic plants, produce oxygen, and they also use oxygen. Here's how these processes work: During a sunny day, dissolved oxygen in water is generally plentiful because photosynthesizing algae and aquatic plants are constantly releasing it into the water. Even though many other organisms are using the oxygen, there is an oxygen surplus. After sundown, without sunlight, photosynthesis slows considerably, or even stops. So, in addition to the usual oxygen demands (from fish, macro-invertebrates, tadpoles, etc.), algae and plants are also pulling oxygen from the water. Too many plants or animals using the oxygen in the system can deplete it and create the potential for a , especially after several days of cloudy weather or low light when less photosynthesis takes place. Factors that Influence the Rate of Photosynthesis and Oxygen Production in Aquatic Plants Water Color Dissolved substances in the water, such as naturally-occurring tea-colored tannins, can prevent sunlight from penetrating down into the water column. This is one reason that many red-water or black-water lakes have few submersed plants. There isn't enough light to allow photosynthesis below a certain depth. These lakes can support emersed or floating-leaved plants which are in direct contact with the sunlight. Turbidity An abundance of suspended clay, silt, or phytoplankton (free-floating algae) can also make a lake turbid or murky, which may slow or prevent submersed plant photosynthesis and growth because of low-light conditions. Florida's Lake Apopka is a good example of the cycle that can occur in a turbid lake. Because of an abundance of algae and suspended sediments in the water that block, scatter or absorb sunlight, submersed plant communities have not been able to re-establish. Without sufficient soil-anchoring plants on the bottom, sediments continue to be re-suspended by wind and wave action, furthering the turbidity problem. Cloudy Weather Several days of cloudy weather can slow the rate of photosynthesis, resulting in lower oxygen production within a waterbody. If you have a small fish pond with an aerator, turn it on during cloudy weather. To learn more, read . Day Length Fewer daylight hours (during autumn and winter) also influence photosynthesis, as well as temperature and humidity. Leaf Characteristics Changes in the condition of a leaf (aging, tearing, etc.), the arrangement of leaves on a branch, even the shape and size of a leaf affects the amount of photosynthesis that occurs in a plant; so much so that two different types of plants have developed over time, based on their tolerance for light. ""Sun plants"" experience an increased rate of photosynthesis as light intensity increases. Leaves on a ""sun plant"" tend to be smaller and thicker, with more pronounced lobes than shade plant leaves. Special cells in these leaves allow higher rates of photosynthesis. ""Shade plants"" photosynthesize at a lower rate, even if a lot of light is available. Their leaves tend to be thinner and longer, with fewer chlorophyll cells, making it easier to photosynthesize under low light conditions. Differences in Photosynthetic Processes While photosynthesis is similar in both aquatic and terrestrial plants, there are a few important differences. For example, emersed plants, floating-leaved plants, and terrestrial plants extract carbon dioxide from the air, while submersed plants extract it from the water. Also, submersed plants have a harder time obtaining carbon dioxide (C02) from the aquatic environment because it has a lower exchange rate of gases. (The diffusion of gases in water is 104 times slower than in air.) To compensate, some plants have leaves that grow above the water, allowing them to also extract C02 from the air. Some aquatic plants such as can live in low light conditions. This means they can grow in deeper water and colonize much earlier in the growing season than other plants. Hydrilla can also become established in lakes with high turbidity when others cannot. No wonder hydrilla has become the most invasive aquatic plant in Florida. Light Attenuation and Photosynthesis Plants use the same visible light spectrum as humans (wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers). However, submersed aquatic plants have a harder time getting the light they need for photosynthesis; suspended particles, dissolved substances and water depth restrict the amount of light that penetrates the water. There are at least two ways to estimate light reduction (or attenuation) in water depth. Secchi disk: The easiest and cheapest method to measure light reduction involves the use of a Secchi disk. The black-and-white disk is lowered into the water and where it becomes invisible is the Secchi depth or Secchi transparency. Once this measurement is obtained, you can multiply it by two to obtain a light attenuation estimate. For example, if a Secchi depth reading for your lake is 5 feet, then multiply it by 2 to get a light attenuation estimate of 10 feet. 2 x 5-foot Secchi depth = 10 feet of light attenuation This means that if your lake is 8 feet deep and the Secchi depth is 5 feet, light is probably reaching the bottom of the lake, and submersed plants can be expected to grow on the bottom. However, if the Secchi disk reading is only 3 feet and the lake depth is 8 feet, light is probably not penetrating to the bottom (2 x 3-foot Secchi depth = 6 feet of light attenuation). In this case, submersed plants are probably not going to grow on the bottom. Most people think of a Secchi disk as a tool for measuring water clarity. However, it can also be used to predict the abundance and type of submersed plants we would expect to find growing in a specific waterbody. Electronic light meter: The second method for measuring light attenuation involves an electronic light meter. A reading is taken immediately below the surface and also at different depths. The readings are used in the following formula to calculate light attenuation: Iz = I0 e-kz Where Iz is the intensity of light at depthI0 is the intensity of light immediately below the surface of the watere is the natural logarithmk is the vertical attenuation (reduction) co-efficient for the downward penetration of light (or ""irradiance"").
