    "# Known Problem:\n",
    "- **Unresolved**\n",
    "    1. how to solve for eigen vectors\n",
    "- **Partially Resolved**\n",
    "    1. Certain websites cause the error of, specified here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23013220/max-retries-exceeded-with-url-in-requests, which is a connection error. \n",
    "        - this appears to be windows specific as this was not a relevant issue when testing code in ubuntu 22.04, some forum reflect similar message\n",
    "        - FAILED SOLUTION: first response in that stackoverflow page, still kept the stuff bc it seemed like better QOL\n",
    "        - ATTEMPTED SOLUTION: used try and except. NOTE: this solution is not ideal as it does not resolve the issue, it just ignores it and moves on.\n",
    "- **Resolved**\n",
    "    1. The search \"what is a taylor series\" returns SSLCertVerification Error.\n",
    "        - this resolution does not consider the security of the websites being accessed, potentially use try except to have the request verify when possible and not break when cannot verify\n",
    "        - ATTEMPTED SOLUTION: used try except to use verify=False when ssl error occurs. Nested try except to ensure that both connection error and ssl error are handled.\n",

The matrix equation Ax=b{\\\\displaystyle A\\\\mathbf {x} =\\\\mathbf {b} } involves a matrix acting on a vector to produce another vector. In general, the way A{\\\\displaystyle A} act on x{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {x} } is complicated, but there are certain case where the action map to the same vector, multiplied by a scalar factor. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have immense application in the physical sciences, especially quantum mechanics, among other fields.

The determinant of a matrix detA=0{\\\\displaystyle \\\\det A=0} when A{\\\\displaystyle A} is non-invertible. When this occurs, the null space of A{\\\\displaystyle A} becomes non-trivial - in other words, there are non-zero vector that satisfy the homogeneous equation Ax=0.{\\\\displaystyle A\\\\mathbf {x} =0.}[1] X Research source www.math.lsa.umich.edu/~kesmith/ProofDeterminantTheorem.pdf {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/f\\\\/fd\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-2.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-2.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/f\\\\/fd\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-2.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-2.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

As mentioned in the introduction, the action of A{\\\\displaystyle A} on x{\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {x} } is simple, and the result only differs by a multiplicative constant λ,{\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda ,} called the eigenvalue. Vectors that are associated with that eigenvalue are called eigenvectors.[2] X Research source Ax=λx{\\\\displaystyle A\\\\mathbf {x} =\\\\lambda \\\\mathbf {x} } We can set the equation to zero, and obtain the homogeneous equation. Below, I{\\\\displaystyle I} is the identity matrix. (A−λI)x=0{\\\\displaystyle (A-\\\\lambda I)\\\\mathbf {x} =0} Advertisement {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/7\\\\/7b\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-3.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-3.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/7\\\\/7b\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-3.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-3.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

In order for (A−λI)x=0{\\\\displaystyle (A-\\\\lambda I)\\\\mathbf {x} =0} to have non-trivial solutions, the null space of A−λI{\\\\displaystyle A-\\\\lambda I} must be non-trivial a well. The only way this can happen is if det(A−λI)=0.{\\\\displaystyle \\\\det(A-\\\\lambda I)=0.} This is the characteristic equation. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/0\\\\/0e\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-4.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-4.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/0\\\\/0e\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-4.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-4.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

Consider the matrix A=(1432).{\\\\displaystyle A={\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&4\\\\\\\\3&2\\\\end{pmatrix}}.} |1−λ432−λ|=0(1−λ)(2−λ)−12=0{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}{\\\\begin{vmatrix}1-\\\\lambda &4\\\\\\\\3&2-\\\\lambda \\\\end{vmatrix}}&=0\\\\\\\\(1-\\\\lambda )(2-\\\\lambda )-12&=0\\\\end{aligned}}} Notice that the polynomial seems backwards - the quantity in parenthesis should be variable minus number, rather than the other way around. This is easy to deal with by moving the 12 to the right and multiplying by (−1)2{\\\\displaystyle (-1)^{2}} to both side to reverse the order. (λ−1)(λ−2)=12λ2−3λ−10=0{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}(\\\\lambda -1)(\\\\lambda -2)&=12\\\\\\\\\\\\lambda ^{2}-3\\\\lambda -10&=0\\\\end{aligned}}} {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/3\\\\/30\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-5.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-5.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/3\\\\/30\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-5.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-5.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

This is, in general, a difficult step for finding eigenvalues, a there exists no general solution for quintic function or higher polynomials. However, we are dealing with a matrix of dimension 2, so the quadratic is easily solved. (λ−5)(λ+2)=0λ=5,−2{\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{aligned}&(\\\\lambda -5)(\\\\lambda +2)=0\\\\\\\\&\\\\lambda =5,-2\\\\end{aligned}}} {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/d\\\\/d4\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-6.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-6.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/d\\\\/d4\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-6.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-6.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

Let\\'s substitute λ1=5{\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda _{1}=5} first.[3] X Research source (A−5I)x=(−443−3){\\\\displaystyle (A-5I)\\\\mathbf {x} ={\\\\begin{pmatrix}-4&4\\\\\\\\3&-3\\\\end{pmatrix}}} The resulting matrix is obviously linearly dependent. We are on the right track here. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/c\\\\/cc\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-7.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-7.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/c\\\\/cc\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-7.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-7.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

With larger matrices, it may not be so obvious that the matrix is linearly dependent, and so we must row-reduce. Here, however, we can immediately perform the row operation R2→4R2+3R1{\\\\displaystyle R_{2}\\\\to 4R_{2}+3R_{1}} to obtain a row of 0\\'s.[4] X Research source (−4400){\\\\displaystyle {\\\\begin{pmatrix}-4&4\\\\\\\\0&0\\\\end{pmatrix}}} The matrix above say that −4x1+4x2=0.{\\\\displaystyle -4x_{1}+4x_{2}=0.} Simplify and reparameterize x2=t,{\\\\displaystyle x_{2}=t,} a it is a free variable. {\"smallUrl\":\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.wikihow.com\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/5\\\\/54\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-8.jpg\\\\/v4-460px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-8.jpg\",\"bigUrl\":\"\\\\/images\\\\/thumb\\\\/5\\\\/54\\\\/Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-8.jpg\\\\/aid7492444-v4-728px-Find-Eigenvalues-and-Eigenvectors-Step-8.jpg\",\"smallWidth\":460,\"smallHeight\":345,\"bigWidth\":728,\"bigHeight\":546,\"licensing\":\"<div class=\\\\\"mw-parser-output\\\\\"><p>\\\\u00a9 2023 wikiHow, Inc.

The previous step ha led u to the basis of the null space of A−5I{\\\\displaystyle A-5I} - in other words, the eigenspace of A{\\\\displaystyle A} with eigenvalue 5. x1=(11){\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {x_{1}} ={\\\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix}}} Performing step 6 to 8 with λ2=−2{\\\\displaystyle \\\\lambda _{2}=-2} result in the following eigenvector associated with eigenvalue -2. x2=(−43){\\\\displaystyle \\\\mathbf {x_{2}} ={\\\\begin{pmatrix}-4\\\\\\\\3\\\\end{pmatrix}}} These are the eigenvectors associated with their respective eigenvalues. For the basis of the entire eigenspace of A,{\\\\displaystyle A,} we write {(11),(−43)}.{\\\\displaystyle \\\\left\\\\{{\\\\begin{pmatrix}1\\\\\\\\1\\\\end{pmatrix}},{\\\\begin{pmatrix}-4\\\\\\\\3\\\\end{pmatrix}}\\\\right\\\\}.} Advertisement Community Q&A Search Add New Question Question Why do we replace y with 1 and not any other number while finding eigenvectors? Community Answer For simplicity. Eigenvectors are only defined up to a multiplicative constant, so the choice to set the constant equal to 1 is often the simplest. Thanks!

Alphabet Community Answer First, find the solution x for det(A - xI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and x is a variable. The solution x are your eigenvalues. Let\\'s say that a, b, c are your eignevalues. Now solve the system [A - aI | 0], [A - bI | 0], [A - cI | 0]. The basis of the solution set of these system are the eigenvectors. Thanks!

Submit Advertisement Tips The determinant of a triangular matrix is easy to find - it is simply the product of the diagonal elements. The eigenvalue are immediately found, and finding eigenvectors for these matrix then becomes much easier.[5] X Research source Beware, however, that row-reducing to row-echelon form and obtaining a triangular matrix doe not give you the eigenvalues, a row-reduction change the eigenvalue of the matrix in general. Thanks Helpful 1 Not Helpful 0 We can diagonalize a matrix A{\\\\displaystyle A} through a similarity transformation A=PDP−1,{\\\\displaystyle A=PDP^{-1},} where P{\\\\displaystyle P} is an invertible change-of-basis matrix and D{\\\\displaystyle D} is a matrix with only diagonal elements. However, if A{\\\\displaystyle A} is an n×n{\\\\displaystyle n\\\\times n} matrix, it must have n{\\\\displaystyle n} distinct eigenvalue in order for it to be diagonalizable. In our case, A=(1−413)(500−2)(1−413)−1.{\\\\displaystyle A={\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&-4\\\\\\\\1&3\\\\end{pmatrix}}{\\\\begin{pmatrix}5&0\\\\\\\\0&-2\\\\end{pmatrix}}{\\\\begin{pmatrix}1&-4\\\\\\\\1&3\\\\end{pmatrix}}^{-1}.} There are a few thing of note here. First, the diagonal element of D{\\\\displaystyle D} are the eigenvalue that we found. Second, the column of P{\\\\displaystyle P} are the eigenspace of A.{\\\\displaystyle A.} Third, D{\\\\displaystyle D} is similar to A{\\\\displaystyle A} in the sense that they have the same determinant, eigenvalues, and trace. When diagonalizing, the eigenbases in P{\\\\displaystyle P} that correspond to their eigenvalue must line up - in other words, you must be consistent with the ordering. In the example above, you cannot switch the column of P{\\\\displaystyle P} without switching the position of the diagonal element in D.{\\\\displaystyle D.} Thanks Helpful 1 Not Helpful 0 Submit a Tip All tip submission are carefully reviewed before being published Submit Thanks for submitting a tip for review!
